He then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers for \u00a350,000. Kostrzewa was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police.", "article": "Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files. A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for \u00a350,000, a court heard today. Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer\u2019s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard. They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer\u2019s door to complain about noise - but he became \u2018infatuated\u2019 with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as \u2018spy games\u2019, \u2018spies\u2019 and \u2018secret documents\u2019 - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took \u2018sensitive or secret material\u2019 and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent. Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive. The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines. Base: Mr Spencer is an engineer on submarines in the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told. Mr Spencer\u2019s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was \u2018infatuated with Shane\u2019. Mr Chalk said: \u2018He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.\u2019 That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen. Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa\u2019s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying \u2018you reject me, you reject me\u2019. The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour\u2019s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had \u2018lost\u2019 Mr Spencer. Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told the Polish man took'sensitive or secret material' and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Miss Berriman also found that she had lost her key to her boyfriend\u2019s flat and Kostrzewa let her into the shared entrance - and then allegedly said he had found her key on the floor of a Co-op store. She was surprised that the key had fallen off the tight-fitting keyring. In the covert recording with the agent Alex, the defendant allegedly said he had \u2018acquired keys to Shane Spencer\u2019s flat\u2019. Mr Chalk said on various dates in March 2014, Kostrzewa used search engines on his computer, entering words including \u2018spy games, secret documents, spies, consulate Republic of Poland\u2019. Mr Spencer went to Gibraltar to work from March 19 to 25. The prosecutor said: \u2018He then offered to sell off the documents relating to UK submarines to the Polish government.\u2019 In April agent Alex rang the Pole and they met on April 10 in Plymouth, going to a hotel room which was rigged up with hidden recording gear. He allegedly said he found a key to access the flat and stole the relevant papers and planned to copy Mr Spencer\u2019s hard drive - and wanted \u00a350,000 for the information. Alex said he 'needed time to consider the documents'. In the recorded conversation, the defendant said \u2018this is only the beginning\u2019. Aerial view: The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer at Devonport (above) and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines.

Celtic's Scott Brown has been cleared of any retrospective punishment for his tackle on Dundee United's Nadir Ciftci, who is facing a two-match ban for violent conduct.

The Englishman escaped a red card after referee Craig Thomson sent off team-mate Paul Paton instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final. That decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on Wednesday, when Celtic will also challenge the red administered to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. Celtic have slammed the SFA\u2019s decision to let Dundee United's Calum Butcher play in the League Cup final. Celtic will challenge the red shown to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. United\u2019s Nadir Ciftci \u2013 already banned from the Hampden showpiece \u2013 faces a further two-match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at Parkhead skipper Scott Brown. But Celtic are furious that Butcher will be free to play in the final, even if Paton is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice. A club statement read: \u2018It seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that, in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed, the Dundee United player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer \u2013 and would be available to play in the League Cup Final and the Scottish Cup replay between the teams \u2013 while Celtic\u2019s player (van Dijk) may potentially miss both of those matches. \u2018Celtic and Virgil van Dijk maintain their position that no red-card offence was committed by Virgil. Virgil will appear at Hampden to put his case on Thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal.\u2019 United refused to comment publicly on Tuesday night, but are privately furious at some of Celtic\u2019s comments. Brown, meanwhile, has escaped retrospective punishment for his tackle on Ciftci. The United striker lashed out in retaliation at the Scotland midfielder before van Dijk and United\u2019s Paton were controversially dismissed by Thomson on the advice of assistant Graham Chambers. Celtic's Scott Brown  accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head. There will be no SFA action against Tannadice winger Aiden Connolly, however, despite claims by Celtic the youngster dived to win a penalty in the Scottish Cup stalemate. Expressing relief that Brown has been cleared to play on Sunday, team-mate Stefan Johansen said the SFA had reached the right decision in that regard. \u2018I saw the tackle from Broony,\u2019 said the Norwegian. \u2018It was just a tackle and everything else was just a lot of players around it. \u2018He would have been a big loss - but I didn\u2019t think that was going to happen. He is the captain and means a lot to the team. We could see how important he is to the team when he was out at the start of the season. He\u2019s a great player and a fantastic captain. He gives it out but he takes it back. That is part of his game. It\u2019s not only him in this league who makes hard tackles.\u2019 The failure to penalise Brown\u2019s challenge was blamed by United boss Jackie McNamara for sparking the incident which saw Ciftci lash out with his boot. Offered a fast-track two-match ban by the SFA compliance officer, Ciftci has until 3pm today to respond to the complaint. If he declines, a Fast Track Tribunal will convene tomorrow. Failure to win his appeal would see the striker miss the Scottish Cup replay with Celtic and the subsequent Premiership clash between the sides. Despite rising tensions, Johansen believes the League Cup final will not go the same way as the Scottish Cup tie \u2013 which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period. \u2018It was a weird game, with three red cards and two penalties,\u2019 he said. \u2018It affects the game, of course, but I think it will be different this time. I don\u2019 t think what happened on Sunday will affect the final. It\u2019s a new game and a trophy is at stake for the winners. \u2018I am just focusing on ourselves.

A daughter who stole almost \u00a370,000 by collecting her dead mother's pension for  17 years has been spared jail. Patricia Baines failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986. Officers found \u00a36,000 of the cash hidden in the 62-year-old's shed during a police search, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Baines, of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, on Friday after pleading guilty to theft earlier this year. An investigation is now under way to establish where the rest of the money is. Recorder David Chinery said he took account of her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold. He said: 'I think you are a vulnerable lady and I am comforted to hear you now have support and are prepared to let people assist you.'

Macmillan Cancer Support has described the situation as 'shameful', and experts believe this is due to late diagnosis, lack of access to the newest drugs and procedures, and the NHS's inability to cope with the increasing numbers of cancer diagnoses. Despite billions of pounds being spent to improve cancer survival rates, Britain has not seen any improvement.", "article": "Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, experts warn. Even for breast cancer \u2013 one of the most treatable forms of the disease \u2013 the figures are still well below those reached by France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s. For lung cancer, the rates are so far behind that patients in Britain are now half as likely to survive as those living in Austria. Macmillan Cancer Support has described the situation as \u2018shameful\u2019 and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in Europe. Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the UK's survival rates (file picture, posed by models) And despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years \u2013 \u00a3640million invested by Labour in the early 2000s and \u00a3750million by the Tories \u2013 Britain does not appear to have gained any ground. In 2002 Labour increased National Insurance tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then Chancellor Gordon Brown specifically to pay for major improvements in the NHS, notably cancer care. But only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by MPs warned of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 variation in care. Data analysed by Macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in Britain survive five years. This is a lower rate than France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s, when the figure was 83 per cent. In these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher. For bowel cancer, 54 per cent of Britons can expect to survive five years, whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in Finland and 55 per cent in Norway, the Netherlands and France. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries, including Austria, Germany and Italy, it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u2018Frankly, this is shameful. What we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable. \u2018If countries like Sweden, France, Finland and Austria can achieve these rates, then the UK can, and should, bridge the gap.\u2019 Experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough, before it has spread to other organs. It may also be down to patients not being offered the newest, most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures, which are routinely available in other countries. This is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail. Experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the NHS cannot cope with the ever-increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer. It is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes. The figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of European countries carried out by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, known as the \u2018Concord programme\u2019. Meanwhile, the latest monthly NHS statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as X-rays, CT scans or ultrasounds \u2013 up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since February 2008. It follows a report by MPs warning of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and \u2018unexplained\u2019 variation in cancer detection and treatment across England \u2013 particularly for the elderly.

{"abstract": "Gillette principal scientist Kristina Vanoosthuyze has revealed the science behind shaving, including why washing the skin is important and why you should never tap your razor on the sink. She recommends showering before shaving to hydrate the hair and reduce the force needed to cut it. Scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin.", "article": "When it comes to shaving, boys are normally taught the art by their fathers or older brothers. But this means bad habits can also be passed down through generations. Now a principal scientist from Gillette has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave, why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink. She also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain. Scroll down for video. Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns in diameter (left) but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. Washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said Gillette principal scientist Kristina Vanoosthuyze. Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze has worked in the Gillette Shaving Technology area at the Innovation Centre in Reading for the past nine years. Every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses, high-speed  cameras and special high-intensity lighting. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair, and in the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade   pulls the hair up,  the second cuts it, the third blade acts in a similar way to the first, and so on. In some of their products, Gillette also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades. This footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair. Every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high-speed cameras. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair. In the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade pulls the hair up, the second cuts it, the third blade pulls and so on. When hydrated, skin is also tighter (an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right). This exposes more of the hair's surface area to the blade. \u00a0As a result Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round. This image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin. Dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut.\u00a0Additionally, the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving glide. Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. This increases the surface area that the blades can cut through, and when hydrated, skin is plumper, which reveals more of the hair. Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull:\u00a0The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave:\u00a0This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. As a result it makes more sense to shower before shaving and not the other way round. 'Allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut,' explained Dr Vanoosthuyze. 'In fact, dry hair can have the strength of copper wire. When hair hydrates, it swells and becomes easier to cut. 'So, men should wash the face and neck with a mild cleanser before the shave. Or at least take a shower before the shave and not the other way around. 'Additionally, the lubricating ingredients formulated in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience.' Scanning electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin, for example. On the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg, while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top. The hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust. The skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on", "candidates": [["Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze, a principal scientist from Gillette, has revealed the science behind shaving, including how hairs behave, why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never tap your razor on the sink.

The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal shot at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent. The year nine student then underwent emergency brain surgery for 'potentially fatal' injuries after fragments of skull went into the teenager's brain. A top grammar school has been fined \u00a310,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries.\u00a0The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal ball at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent. The boy, who was formerly a keen rugby player, has been told he will never play again. The victim had been part of a class of 24 Year nine pupils taking part in a multi-sports PE lesson on June 20 last year hugely over-subscribed grammar school. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. The pupil suffered a severely fractured skull and was rushed to Kings College Hospital in London. He was due to have an operation to alleviate the swelling in his brain but it was decided the surgery could have worsened his condition. A few days later his condition deteriorated and he underwent emergency brain surgery to remove fluid from the brain. The school's governing body was hauled in front of Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court today charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. Prosecuting, Kevin Golding said: 'It's unclear what the long term impact will be. 'He has recovered sufficiently to return to school but we don't yet know the long term impact on his memory, intellect, mood, personality and his future employment prospects.' The court heard the teacher in charge, David Joseph, has taught at Judd for 10 years, and has been a teacher for 28 years overall. He was in the centre of the sports field overlooking the javelin throwing pupils when the incident happened. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle, the court heard. He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit the victim on the head. Defending, Dominic Adamson said that although the boy's injuries were the result of an unfortunate accident, the health and safety procedures in place were not conducive to a serious risk of it happening. The court heard the victim was a very keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed rugby. Because of the injuries he sustained and the indentation to his skull, it was said that he will never play again. Mr Golding said: 'The victim was seriously injured and fortunate not to have suffered fatal injuries. 'He has sadly suffered life changing injuries which could have been avoided. 'He was a very keen sportsman, particularly his love of rugby, and the damage and indentation he still has at the base of his skull means he can't play rugby anymore. 'He and his family have endured a difficult nine months and face more difficult times ahead.' Chair of the bench Nick Bensted-Smith said the victim had suffered a'very serious and devastating injury' as a result of the incident and the school received a fine of \u00a310,000, legal costs of \u00a31,375 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120.

The teacher is not facing any disciplinary action by the school and has not been charged with any criminal offences. The Judd School pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to ensure that a child in their care was, so far as is reasonably practicable, not exposed to risks to their health or safety. They suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place. Head teacher Robert Masters said: 'The Judd School expresses its deepest regret over the serious accident which took place in a PE lesson on 20 June 2014, when a student was hit on the head by a shot put thrown by another student.

The judge made the girls wards of court, preventing them from leaving the UK, and removed their passports and those of adults involved in their care. The ruling comes after authorities have been making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people from travelling to areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants.", "article": "Five teenage girls who showed 'an interest' in travelling to Syria have been barred by a High Court judge from travelling abroad. Mr Justice Hayden today made the two 15-year-olds and three 16-year-olds wards of court - a move which prevents them from leaving the jurisdiction of England and Wales. He made the ruling at a hearing at the High Court after Tower Hamlets local authority raised concerns. The five girls were made wards of court, which prevents them from leaving the UK. Mr Justice Hayden made the ruling today at the High Court (pictured) after hearing the girls had'shown an interest' in travelling to Syria. The judge, who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from Tower Hamlets in East London, also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care. He said the ban was a \u00a0'draconian' step, as was the removal of the passport. Mr Justice Hayden told the hearing: 'But the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in Syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely. 'As I said early this week in another case, and I repeat it in this, sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people, ultimately from themselves. The judge said the ban was a 'draconian' step, but necessary to protect the girls. Pictured: Aleppo, Syria. 'Therefore I am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought.' The girls and adults concerned, who were not in court today, can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish. The judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family. He also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services, and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position. 'It seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls.' Authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants. The ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16-year-old boy from Brighton from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. The judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region. Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February. Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting. Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales. In February Sharmeena Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. All four schoolgirls attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. Sharmeena is now living in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride and told her father she will never come home.", "candidates": [["A High Court judge has barred five teenage girls from travelling abroad after they showed an interest in travelling to Syria.

During a 12-year long search to find his real parents, Aaron Levi, 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player  is his father. After he found his biological mother 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, the white British woman told him she conceived him after a one-night stand with Chamberlain, he told\u00a0Sports Illustrated. Documents with background information about Levi's biological parents noted that Elizabeth would not identify the father to protect his name, and that she gave Levi up for adoption because she felt she could not raise a bi-racial child. Scroll down for video. During a 12-year long search to find his birth parents, Aaron Levi (left), 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player, Wilt Chamberlain, is his father. But Chamberlain, who died in 1999, claimed that he would never have a child. The 7'1' star, who once scored 100 points in one game, boasted about having slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above.\u00a0He worked out he slept with, on average, 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Even though the 7'1' star claimed he slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above, he maintained until he died in 1999 that he did not have any children. Chamberlain, who once scored 100 points in one game, worked out he slept with on average 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Levi, who stands at 6'5' tall, said that had he known the San Francisco Warrior  player was his father 20 years ago, when Chamberlain was still alive, his life would have been completely different. Born in 1965, Levi was raised in Oregon by adoptive parents Don and Harriet, and only knew very few details about his birth parents growing up. 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, said she met Chamberlain at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out with him a few nights later. She said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment, and that night Levi was conceived. He began the search for them in 2003 and got closer to answers after collecting background information  in 2004. The information, which is believed to be provided entirely by Elizabeth, said that Levi's mother was a white woman of English-French descent; while details of his father included that he was was a black professional basketball player who was 6'10', born in Kansas and held a Masters degree. However, the details did not exactly match with those of Chamberlain: the NBA star was from Philadelphia and attended the University of Kansas for only three years without obtaining a degree. As he continued to search for more answers, in 2009, Levi received a birth certificate with Elizabeth's name and was eventually connected with her. He said: 'It's been a burden on me to feel that I am her secret, and I am Wilt's secret, and I am the Chamberlain family's secret. 'That's been hard for me...I already know what's going to happen if I don't do anything. I'm going to have an unfinished journey.' After a more than hour-long conversation, she revealed the details of her 'casual relationship' with Chamberlain. Elizabeth said they met at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out a few nights later, when she said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment. When Chamberlain learned of the news that Elizabeth was pregnant, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' That night, she conceived Levi and five months later told him she was pregnant and had plans to give the child up for adoption. When Chamberlain learned of the news, he  chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' Levi has tried to reach out to some of Chamberlain's relatives who remain closed to meeting him and refuse to participate in DNA tests because they feel doubts surround his claim. In his continued mission of self-discovery, he hopes to inspire other people who have been adopted to begin their searches earlier than he did. Levi and Elizabeth met in person in 2010, where they had different feelings about Chamberlin, and spent time together again in England last Fall. He said: 'I wanted her to tell me something good about him, but that wasn't going to happen. I realized that we had different feelings about him.

Scroll down for video. Shocking footage has emerged online of a man hurling racial abuse at two Muslim men on a bus. The 60-year-old mother of two, from Lower Hutt, told Daily Mail Australia the rant had started for more than half an hour on the bus before she stepped in. 'I ignored it for a good half an hour,' Ms Walker said. 'The guys didn't know their way around the area so another lady and I tried to direct them to their destination but then they started to get abused by that man. 'I don't see myself as a hero. I just needed to stand up for myself and the guys because of what he said. He also abused me and called me names.' In the video, Ms Walker is heard speaking back at the old man, telling him to 'behave'.

A female passenger named Pene Walker (pictured) was hailed a hero after she intervened to defend the two men. 'Shut your mouth up. Get f***,' the man said to Ms Walker, who was sitting a couple of rows in front. Ms Walker then turns around and says 'excuse me' before the man continues to verbally abuse her. 'Come on then - I'll take your back,' the man said. 'F*** turn around, turn around. Shut your mouth up b****.'

Education secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered an urgent investigation into the school after it emerged two dead Islamist fighters were also taught at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London. Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia. Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers. Ministers have ordered an urgent investigation into the school attended by Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) after it emerged two dead extremist fighters \u00a0- including Choukri Ellekhlifi (right) - were also taught there.

Quintin Kynaston Academy's (pictured) head insisted the school is 'not a breeding ground for terrorists' 'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.'

Alex Atherton told The Telegraph: 'QK has been proactive in working with the government's Prevent strategy, and this has resulted in positive work around the well-being and safety of our students. 'Students that may have attended nine years ago are not a reflection of the students we are proud of having at QK, and we will continue to put in place support mechanisms to make sure all our students feel safe and that they can raise any concerns.' One unnamed man who claimed to be a student alongside Ellekhlifi at QK told the paper he and his friends saw 'quite a lot of young men going towards a radicalised direction', but said he didn't realise the extent of it, adding 'It was a massive shock' when he learnt that Ellekhlifi went to Syria.

He also points out that Mercedes had the wisdom to start out ahead of the game, while Honda is having to play catch-up in public, which is painful for them and McLaren.", "article": "John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, he assesses McLaren's troubled start to the season and the disappointing curtain raiser in Melbourne. John Watson (right) pictured last year with Sir Jackie Stewart, Karun Chandhok and Damon Hill. McLaren have moved from Mercedes engines to Honda and it is a bit like any relationship; it takes time. Formula One has gone down the route of trying to cut costs, and as a result, we have seen a substantial cut in track testing which will hinder McLaren's chances of improving this term. I would like to see teams allowed to test more simply because I think the public is beginning to wonder what we\u2019re watching. Are we seeing an exercise in extremely high-level technical games or are we looking at Formula One as an entertainment and sport? What is Formula One's objective? And where does it see itself going? I understand that TV viewing figures in Germany for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix were down nearly 50 per cent  on the norm and I don\u2019t think that is very good sign. Lewis Hamilton won the season-opening race in Australia ahead of \u00a0Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton led from start-to-finish as Mercedes dominated the first race of the new Formula One season. Maybe in Britain it wasn\u2019t so bad because of Lewis Hamilton's recent success, but there is a downside to domination, and we saw that at the turn of the century with Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, and then with four years of Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel. My big concern, and I hope I am not being over-reactionary here, is that there are so many teams in the pit-lane that are struggling financially. Giedo van der Garde's legal case against Sauber in Melbourne was hugely embarrassing and dominated the agenda at the Australian Grand Prix. It is systematic of where Formula One is right now. Driver talent is clearly secondary to budgets, albeit with a few exceptions at the sharp end of the grid. Teams desperately need funding. My other worry is whether global companies are looking at F1 as a sport which they want to commit to. I don\u2019t see any substantial company coming in as a title sponsor to any team. Hamilton is bidding to become the first British driver to win consecutive Formula One world championships. Pastor Maldonado crashed on the opening lap while Lotus team-mate Romain Grosjean retired moments later. The sport, whether it is the governing body, the FIA or CVC, Formula One\u2019s commercial rulers, need to sit down and say \"what are we doing?\" \"what are we trying to achieve?\" and \"are we achieving it?\" Last year we did have some good races, but I don\u2019t want to see another grand prix like Melbourne where at the end of the opening lap we had effectively just 13 cars running. Manor didn't get out of their garage. Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat suffered mechanical gremlins on their way to the grid. And both Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado failed to complete a lap. It is not acceptable. Formula One let itself down and it is a shame because the opening round of the championship, particularly with Melbourne being the sporting capital of the world, had a poor race. In the case of both McLaren and Honda, make no mistake, the achievement of getting back to the top as quickly as possible is absolutely paramount. They are a team who have won multiple world championships, but the last two years have been their worst since 1981. But I am confident they know what they have got to do, and they have put steps in place to rectify their problems. Jenson Button finished in last place, and two laps down on race winner Hamilton at the 2015 curtain-raiser. Kevin Magnussen, who deputised for Fernando Alonso, waves to the crowd ahead of the race in Melbourne. This year there is a four-engine limit for the entire season. So, combine that with the limited testing, and restrictions on engines, and how are engine manufacturers, particularly somebody coming into this Formula, such as Honda, expected to catch up, let alone match, those who started last year? Mercedes began their programme way back in 2011 and what you are seeing is the culmination of a lot of work which was done parallel to the team competing in 2012 and 2013. Renault were distracted with winning titles with Vettel and Red Bull while Ferrari didn't appear to grasp what was required. That is fundamentally why Mercedes hold the advantage. They had the wisdom to start out ahead of the game. Honda are having to play catch-up in public which is painful for them and McLaren.

But the off-the-grid property, made of glass and wood, isn't just known for it's sweeping views of the city of Bergen below. In order to reach the small architectural marvel, guests are required to crawl through its tunnel-like entryway, which remarkably resembles an otherworldly black hole. High above the city of Bergen in Norway sits the Tubakuba cabin, which boasts a very unusual, vortex-like entryway. Made up entirely of glass and wood, staying overnight in the cabin is free for families with young children. Designed as part of a workshop at the Bergen School of Architecture, OPA Form Architect, Espen Folgero was the mastermind behind the striking cabin. It's name is inspired by the tuba, thanks in large part to its curved entryway that opens like a vortex to the woods outside. The interior is made of plywood, while the exterior is crafted from burnt larch that has been treated with a traditional Japanese method called Shou Sugi Ban to prevent fungal decay. It's the portal-like entrance that's really something special, however, made up of curved shavings of pine and untreated larch, which will turn gray with time. The interior is made of plywood and has floor to ceiling windows along one side to allow guests to experience the breathtaking views. There is no electricity and the cabin's amenities are basic with only a wooden stove, bare wooden platforms and lofted sleeping space. To reach the inside of the 14-square-metre cabin, everyone must crawl through the house's 'black hole' tunnel entrance. Best of all, for families with young children, it's free to stay overnight in the playful space. The 14-square-metre cabin offers basic amenities, such as a wood stove, bare wooden platforms and a lofted sleeping area. There's no electricity, but the property is so small that it doesn't require much heating. And it's the view that guests truly stop by for: large windows overlooking the rocky mountainside give visitors the impression that they are 'floating' above the valley below. Every detail of the tunnel was considered, right down to the the use of untreated larch wood, which will turn grey with time. These drawings show exactly how the architecture students envisioned guests relaxing in the lofted sleeping spaces. Referred to as a 'wooden bubble,' the property has since been nominated for a European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture. Sketching was an important part of the students' learning process and helped them identify structural problems and solutions. The tuba-like tunnel is not just a way to reach the cabin's interior, it's also a play space in and of itself for children if the hut is closed. Speaking to Fast Company, architect Espen Folgero explained the concept behind the avant garde house. 'The entrance is shaped like a mouth of a tuba to experiment with wood as a material, to give children a place to play even if the hut is closed, and to force adults to crouch to get in, even if kids don't have to,' he said.

She has adapted her diet and workout routine to include more calorie-dense foods and core strengthening exercises.

In her early twenties Marika Magriplis, from Sydney, used to be too small for an Australian dress size six while working in a corporate job and living off a diet of convenience food including noodles and cheap burgers. Today - after overhauling her diet and lifestyle in 2010 - she\u2019s just two weeks from giving birth to her first child and credits exercise and nutrient-rich meals with her 'having nothing to whinge about while pregnant\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been lucky with my diet and lifestyle but I\u2019ve got away with very minimal side effects with this pregnancy,\u2019 Marika told Daily Mail Australia. Her feet \u2018only swelled up once\u2019 and instead of wishing to indulge in sweat treats her only craving has been \u2018tuna with vinegar\u2019. Scroll down for video. 'In the last week he has had another spurt... 22 days to go':\u00a0Marika Magriplis, who is nine months pregnant (left), has credited working out (right) with keeping nasty pregnancy side effects at bay. The 29-year-old, a qualified personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, ditched her unhealthy lifestyle in 2010. Since 2012, when she first began competing in bodybuilding competitions around Australia, Marika has spent six days of the week weight training and eating a protein-rich diet. After becoming pregnant she adapted her training, with the help of experts, by reducing her weight sessions each trimester and including more calorie-dense foods into her diet to feed her growing bump. \u2018My training became more about core strengthening than building,\u2019 Marika said. \u2018Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off. At one stage \u2013 about halfway through my pregnancy I had really bad back pain because I made the weights too light - my body needed the strength,\u2019 she explained. However, now with just 14 days until her due date Marika has stopped weight-lifting altogether as she prepares to become a mum. Marika explained that she has kept up weights during pregnancy to maintain strength, not to build muscle like before. Marika's amazing transformation from a tiny 39 kilos to a strong bodybuilder came after she began lifting weights and learning about nutrition. \u2018Physically I\u2019ve made peace and listen to my body now and I\u2019ve dropped back on the training side of things. Now it\u2019s a about prenatal yoga and a lot of stretching and preparing the body for birth.\u2019 Marika, who is now a qualified personal trainer, weighed 39 kilos in 2007 after graduating from uni. \u2018I was tiny just through lack of knowledge\u2026 health wasn\u2019t a priority it was just about making money,\u2019 she explained. When she was competing as a bodybuilder before she was pregnant, Marika's daily diet would include:. Morning. An omelette with two whole eggs and three egg whites with cucumber or broccoli or green beans on the side. 'Its sounds odd for breakfast but it has everything you need, essential fats and fibre  from the veg and protein from the egg whites,' Marika said. Lunch. Fish or chicken, basically a lean white protein, with some salad and some nuts. Snack. Greek yoghurt (around 150 grams) with a handful of nuts and some protein powder. Dinner. White or sweet potato with meat and veg. 'I would have carbs after weight training. It breaks all the rules but if you think about your body as a machine, you need to refuel and  carbs work as energy. 'If you have fats in the morning, keeping them separately for different needs,' Marika explained. Exercise. Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding. After weights she would have a banana and a protein shake. On day seven Marika would balance weights with a slow walk along the beaches near her home. This was her 'active recovery day'. Marika said one of her favourite core exercises before she was pregnant was 'hanging leg raises'. After she became pregnant with her first child, Marika took advice from her chiropractor, midwife and physio and adapted her workout routine and diet. Morning. Multi-grain bread, oats, or muesli with fruit. Or eggs on toast. Snack. Greek yoghurt and nuts. Or a nut and muesli bar when nauseous. 'I couldn\u2019t even think about eating chicken and greens. The thought of it just made me want to throw up, it was a big adjustment,' Marika said. Lunch. Tuna as well as fresh fruit. Dinner. Similar to before pregnancy.

David Cameron should rule out coalition with any other party after the general election, according to Boris Johnson. The London Mayor suggests it would be 'fatal' for the Conservative Party to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power-sharing deal with the Liberal Democrats or another smaller party. 'We should say \"stuff coalition with anyone\",' Mr Johnson told the Daily Mail. 'We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. 'If we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party, it would be absolutely fatal.' Asked whether the Prime Minister should rule out a second coalition altogether, Mr Johnson replied: 'Yes. Otherwise people don't know what they are voting for.' Lord Steel says there is no appetite among Liberal Democrats for another coalition \u2013 or among the two big parties. 'A lot of David Cameron's Tories want a Tory-only government, even if it's a minority one, and similarly on the Labour side,' the former Liberal leader told the BBC. 'I suspect \u2013 if you have to look into the crystal ball \u2013 that we're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament, which is something new, and they'll be able to play one off against the other.' He said the most that Lib Dems would countenance in another hung parliament would be a 'confidence and supply deal', where they agreed to support a larger party in key votes but did not enter a formal coalition or take ministerial jobs. He also said that his party needed to'recharge its values'. Mr Johnson, who is Mr Cameron's chief leadership rival, criticised the fixed-term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition \u2013 suggesting it should be repealed. 'The sooner it expires, the better. I always thought it was some bit of Lib Dem nonsense,' he said. 'Constitutionally the thing we need to address is the rank injustice that it takes so many thousands more votes to elect a Conservative rather than Labour MP. It's an absolute scandal.' Former Conservative minister Sir Alan Duncan has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed-term legislation, branding it a'recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings'. Labour's Jack Straw and Tory Kenneth Clarke support the move. Critics say five years is too long, risking a 'zombie parliament' in the final year. Few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election. Boris Johnson - considered Mr Cameron's main rival for the Tory leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election. It means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the Queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable. Instead, they need to win the support of a'supermajority' of two thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period. This means the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents. The only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no-confidence. But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. A new coalition could therefore take power without an election.

Footage taken on a mobile phone captured the horrifying scenes as they unfolded outside the Britannia Hotel before the violence\u00a0spilled into the hotel foyer. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the battle took place between the Firetown and the 623 gangs who joined forces to confront another unnamed rival group. An imitation firearm was fired in the air by a 16-year-old who then pointed the weapon at another of the girls while Connor Chambers, 17, was seen waving a knife at a rival. The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19. The schoolboy fled into the foyer of the Britannia Hotel where he was involved in a scuffle and was later found to have suffered a stab wound to the chest that required five stitches.

Tribunal chairman, Ian Callinan QC, ruled that the Sharks board failed to allow the 29-year-old footballer due process before severing his contract. This came after a photograph of the player urinating into his own mouth went viral on social media last June. Mr Carney's contract was torn up after a photo emerged of the player urinating in his own mouth. The committee\u2019s findings state that the former Dally M medallist should have been allowed an opportunity to plead his case in front of the Cronulla board. Cronulla Sharks chairman Damien Keough said the club will respect the decision made by the appeals committee, adding it is their responsibility to follow correct procedure. \u201cThe big oversight was that someone needed to check that the process being followed was correct,\u2019\u2019 Keogh told The Telegraph. Mr Carney's agent claims the photo was a set up and 'an optical illusion' \u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember here is that it\u2019s not a question of the facts, it\u2019s a question of the process, but the reality of the situation is, the decision would likely have been the same. He said he wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of the former Origin player returning to the league but 'there has been a lot of water that has flown under the bridge since last June.' There's no denying Mr Carney is a talented player, however, his antics off the field have led to the termination of three contracts. The Daily Mail Australia reached out to the Cronulla Sharks however they declined to comment. Mr Carney is currently in France nursing broken ribs, sustaining the injury in only his second game for the English Super League Club Catalans. After what most believed was ultimately the end of the troubled player's career, the five-eighth may surprise us all by staging a return to the league. The disgraced player fled to France to pick up the pieces of his damaged career where he sustained a rib injury. As Cronulla is the third team to terminate a contract with the fallen star, the question remains, which team would be game to pick up the controversial player?

For 18 months the couple, said to be worth a combined \u00a3210million, have spent \u00a35million improving the palatial west London  home -\u00a0an inner-city replacement for their sprawling Hertfordshire estate 'Beckingham Palace'. But at least one neighbour is upset about plans to install air conditioning in five rooms, including in the new gym and wine cellar. Moving in: The Beckhams are spending \u00a35million on building work before they move into their new London home, pictured, but a neighbour has complained over plans to install air conditioning. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria\u2019s shoe collection. Portfolio: The couple, pictured together at a charity dinner, have applied for planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence after they sold Beckingham Palace in Hertfordshire - they already have homes in California, France and Dubai. One resident has written to the local council and said he 'totally disagrees' with the plans, which 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. MailOnline understands that the complainant is worried about air conditioning units being attached to the mansion, because of the visual impact and the humming noise. His letter said: 'The council must identifed (sic) our deep concerns about all adverse impacts on living conditions from noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from construction and from associated traffic, in addition to concerns about impacts on drainage, on appearance and landscape, on structural stability, and on historic buildings.' The Beckhams have hired designer Rose Uniacke to oversee the project and plans for 'internal alterations at all levels' were approved in February this year. This included the enlargement of the lower ground floor wine cellar and the installation of a retractable cinema screen. They also want to re-configure two bathrooms while removing a third-floor guest bathroom to form an extended bedroom and sitting room. When ready, the  home will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room. The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria\u2019s shoe collection. Staff and security will have access to a tunnel which will take them unseen to a second property. The couple have already installed a sound system so that music can be played in every room, and which can be controlled by a phone or computer. They are planning on adding specially designed waterproof plasma TVs in every bathroom. Their children Brooklyn, 16; Romeo, 12; Cruz, ten; and daughter Harper, three, will take over the second floor of the house which has three bedrooms, all with en-suite bathrooms.

Family: David Beckham  takes a selfie of himself and his children (L-R) Brooklyn Beckham, Romeo Beckham, Cruz Beckham and Harper Beckham, before Victoria's event at New York Fashion Week. All the children will have huge amounts of space in the mansion. Particulars: These photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show the mansion needs refurbishing since it was last updated in the 1990s. The lower ground floor includes a study, a gym and massage room, three service rooms and a small garden and there is an underground garage where David can keep his fleet of cars. David and Victoria reportedly sold their Hertfordshire home, known as Beckingham Palace, for \u00a312million. However, they also own homes in California, Dubai and a \u00a32.6million holiday home in the South of France. The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate just three months after their wedding in 1999 for \u00a32.5million. They submitted a fresh application for air-conditioning in February, with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council expected to make a decision on it in the next three weeks. The Beckhams will also be installing underfloor heating at the home. Photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show it needs redecorating. But estate agent Becky Fatemi, who runs Rokstone, believes when the project is finished it will be a brilliant family home.

{"abstract": "France has recently approved a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die, which has sparked debate among doctors, religious leaders, and pro-euthanasia campaigners. The bill has been backed by the Socialist government and would also force doctors to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves. In northern Belgium, the acceptance of euthanasia has greatly increased since it was legalised in 2002, with 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in 2007 increasing to 4.6 percent in 2013.", "article": "France is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die. The bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide, but would give people 'the right to deep, continuous sedation until death'. This must be at the patient's request, but only when their condition is life-threatening in the short-term. Protests: Demonstrators gather near the French National Assembly holding white silhouettes as part of a silent protest against euthanasia in Paris on March 10. Slogans read: 'Let's relieve but do not kill' On March 10. pro-euthanasia demonstrators held signs reading: 'Francois let's act like Holland'. Euthanasia has been taking place in Holland for many years. The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate. Backed by the Socialist government, the bill would also force doctors in France to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves, or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes. Almost one in 20 people in northern Belgium died using euthanasia in 2013, more than doubling the numbers in six years, a study released today showed. The universities of Ghent and Brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002, the acceptance of ending a life at the patient's request has greatly increased. While a 2007 survey showed 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in the region, the figure was 4.6 percent in 2013. 'Euthanasia has been increasingly accepted by the patients as a valid option at the end of their life,' said Ghent University ethics professor Freddy Mortier. 'Physicians themselves are more inclined to comply with the wishes of the patients.\" Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Earlier this month in a speech at France's lower house of Parliament, Prime minister Manuel Valls praised 'a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully, in dignity and without suffering'. The bill has stirred debate in France and prompted a call for the preservation of 'the prohibition of killing' by five high-profile Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. It has prompted protests by those claiming the bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, as well as pro-euthanasia campaigners who believe it does not go far enough. Doctors are also divided about the idea. So-called terminal or 'palliative sedation' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses, or until they starve. The method does not actively kill patients, but some doctors say it can mean patients are sedated for weeks before they die, and that it may be more humane to euthanise. French debate over end-of-life legislation resurfaced last year over the case of comatose Frenchman Vincent Lambert. His wife wants doctors to stop life support but his parents disagree. The case is pending at the European Court of Human Rights.

After Joy sold the house in 2013, the new owners asked Barker to take her camera around the house to document the sisters' lives.", "article": "Two single beds side by side, canes hanging from coat hooks and retro British food tins on a gingham-covered countertop - these are the poignant images that capture the lives of two elderly sisters in their family home. Jean and Joy Taylor were born in the house in Ryde, Isle of Wight, in 1916 and 1922, never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until Jean's death in 2008. Now their quiet, old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer Zoe Barker, with her picture series, The House Of Two Sisters. Scroll down for video. The sisters' guest room is decorated with pink candlewick bedspreads, an electric fire and family pictures on the mantelpiece. Jean's picture is in the centre, to  the right is their brother Jim in his Royal Artillery Uniform. The new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a 'cool cupbord' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese, butter and eggs. Jean Taylor (left) was born, lived and died in her home in Ryde, Isle of Wight; after the loss of her sister in 2008,  Joy, now 99, (right) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home. Barker's pictures are as much a document of the sisters' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing Britain. Her images  record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs, tins of treacle in the kitchen, a dressing table and highly-patterned carpets. There are no computers cluttering up surfaces, or plugs, wires and cables wending around furniture  and only a few black and white photographs  decorate on the walls. The women were born into a well-known local family, which originally set up a successful coaching business in the town in the 1840s. They also had two brothers James and John. Barker said: 'Very much a family home in the early days, the sisters shared the house with their mother and their Aunt Edie until both mother and aunt passed away. This was Jean's home all her life.' Aged 23 and 17 respectively when the Second World War broke out, the Taylor sisters came of age in an era of thrift, rationing and self-sacrifice.\u00a0And their wartime experiences are evident throughout the house. The  dressing table in the twin bedroom that Jean and Joy shared. Their beds are seen reflected in the mirror. The new owners have kept the old Electrolux hoover along with the carpet that remains in this room. Jean and Joy shared a bedroom from the 1950s until Jean's death. The  picture on the wall is of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who was never found after bailing out over the sea near Dunkirk. Both of their brothers survived the war and there is a picture of James, who served in North Africa and Italy while John fought in the jungles of Burma, on the guest bedroom mantelpiece. In their neat, almost spartan, room is a black and white photo of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who victory-rolled over the house whenever he flew over the island. On 4 June, 1941, he was seen to bail out over the sea near Dunkirk but was never found. The smaller photograph in the corner of the same frame is Bill Tudhope, a bomber pilot who was engaged to one of their cousins. He failed to return from a bombing mission over Germany in 1940. Barker said: 'In 1957 Joy left to live in London, though returned to the house almost every weekend. On retiring in 1981 she returned to live with her sister and they remained there together until Jean's death. 'Neither of them ever married. Despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until Jean passed away.' These plastic flowers were given to the sisters by the grandmother of the woman who delivered their lunches in the last two years of Jean's life. Niece Gill remembers how impractical these armchair 'tables' were andmugs of tea would slip off unless held on to tightly. Joy Taylor sold the house in 2013 but her coat still hangs on the coat rack along with the sisters' canes (left); the women hung their Sunday best dresses on the back of the bedroom door (right). Their niece Gill, who says her aunts were always smart dressers, remembers Jean wearing this two-piece on warm summer days. The Isle of Wight-based photographer was asked to take her camera around the house  by the new owners after Joy - the last of the Taylor family in Ryde - sold her house in 2013 to move into a care home. She said:\u00a0'The new owners are lovely - a middle-aged couple with a teenage daughter. They are all massive appreciators of old things so it couldn't be in better hands.

A secret 'death ray' laser was developed during the Falklands War and ordered for testing by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, documents reveal. Britain was said to have worked with America to develop the high powered lasers for use on the battlefield during the 1970s and 1980s. The beam, nicknamed a 'death ray', had been developed quickly because of fears over the weapons possessed by the Soviets - but was never used. But Lady Thatcher was said to be so impressed with the technology she ordered testing to take place during the Falklands War, the Daily Express reported. Existence of the laser was revealed in the National Archives, in a letter - marked 'top secret' from the then Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine to Lady Thatcher in 1983 about the weapons owned by the Soviets and Britain's position. It said: 'You may recall that we developed and deployed with great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low-flying Argentinian pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic. 'The weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted circle.' The letter was revealed under the 30 year rule. Sheffield academic Dr David Clarke found the letter in his search of the archives and said the 'naval laser weapon' referred to a device tested, but never used in anger, when troops were defending the Suez Canal in 1941. Margaret Thatcher (pictured front, centre) visited HMS Hermes when it came back from the Falklands War. This device used powerful searchlights to dazzle pilots as they attacked Royal Navy ships. In 1982, when the Falkland Islands was invaded, it was decided to use the same tactics to try and blind enemy pilots. In the 1980s Britain was said to be focused on developing\u00a0medium power lasers directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes, optic and electro-optic sensors. These weapons was designed to target low flying aircraft by 'dazzling' pilots targeting ships. The 'death ray' was said to be unlikely to be unsuccessful in targeting ships but would work on humans. Britain's laser weapon research in the 1980s was covered by two programmes - known as Raker and Shingle. According to the correspondence from Mr Heseltine, Britain had been working with America on developing laser weapons since the 1970s. Mr Heseltine also detailed fears in his letter to Lady Thatcher about the Soviets were developing a range of secret beam weapons. However he said he was uncertain whether owning these weapons was useful. In the letter he added:\u00a0'the Russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid-1980s (in fact, the Russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser Kirov)'.

This means that a young couple who jointly save \u00a324,000 could get \u00a36,000 from the Government. Scroll down for video. George Osborne announced a new first-time buyers Isa for those saving for a deposit and looking to get onto the property ladder. It will give them \u00a350 from the Government for every \u00a3200 they put away. Groups of friends who buy together would also be able to take out one Isa each and get additional bonuses. The scheme was hailed as a massive boost for first-time buyers, amid claims it could cut the average time taken to save for a deposit by up to a year. David Hollingworth, director at brokers London & Country, said: \u2018This is basically free money. \u2018It will help combat the issue which really affects first-time buyers who complain that they cannot save as quick as house prices are rising. \u2018It is quite a large perk the Government is paying.\u2019 The average UK first-time buyer currently pays around \u00a3150,000 for a home, putting down an average deposit of \u00a325,000, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Set to be launched by banks and building societies this Autumn, it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to \u00a33,000. This means that a young couple who jointly save \u00a324,000 could get \u00a36,000 from the Government. In London, the typical price paid for a first home is \u00a3260,000. Last year around 25,000 first-time buyers a month made it on to the property ladder, with an average income of \u00a338,000. However, steep rises in house prices around the country \u2013 particularly in London and the South East \u2013 mean that it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to save the deposit needed. 76,400 Employment growth in Yorkshire between 2010 and 2013 compared to 66,000 in the whole of France. 2.6% UK growth in 2014 \u2013 faster than any other advanced economy including Germany and seven times the level in France. 100,000 Fall in unemployment announced yesterday. 5.3% Expected unemployment rate this year \u2013nearly half the eurozone\u2019s average of 9.8 per cent. 30.94m Number in work \u2013 a record. 1.9m Number of jobs created since 2010. 73.3% Percentage of working age people now in employment \u2013 the highest rate since records began. 80% Percentage of jobs created which are full-time. 80% Percentage of jobs created which are skilled. 1,000 Number of jobs created every day. \u00a3900 The average amount that households are better off by, compared to 2010. 0.2% Projected inflation rate this year. \u00a31,000 Interest people will now be able to earn on their savings tax-free. \u00a350 Top-up given to the savings of first-time buyers by the Government for every \u00a3200 they save in a new Help to Buy Isa. \u00a335bn Cut in Government interest payments on the national debt thanks to low inflation rate. \u00a35.2bn Projected size of budget surplus in 2018/19. 71.6% Debt as a share of GDP in 2019/20, down from 80.3% last year. \u00a313bn Expected proceeds from the sale of Government assets in Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley. The Government already has a number of initiatives aimed at those trying to buy their first property. The original Help to Buy scheme, which has proved extremely popular, allows people to buy a home worth up to \u00a3600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit. The Government provides them with a loan \u2013 which is initially interest-free \u2013 to make up the rest of the down payment. Around 45,000 buyers have benefited from the scheme so far. The new Isa is the latest attempt by the Government to help first-time buyers. The accounts will work like a traditional Isa, with interest paid out by banks and building societies tax-free. They will be available to new account-holders for four years \u2013 but once opened there is no limit on how long someone can save for. Savers can make an initial deposit of \u00a31,000 when they open the Isa, but after this can only pay in a maximum of \u00a3200 a month. A \u00a350 bonus is then added by the Treasury.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Ms Gibson claimed her son's childcare details, her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce  backlash against her. She said that was the reason 'police came to our home checking in on my safety' last week. Ms Gibson also hit out at some of her critics, saying that while she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion', some people had responded'maliciously'. Belle Gibson: Doubt has been cast on the Whole Pantry founder's stories as people demand answers from the health guru. Doting young mum: Ms Gibson has expressed concern about her family's safety after her son's childcare details were allegedly placed online. Ms Gibson's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. The Instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis, saying she would 'have a statement live this week' where she would address medical questions. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. 'I do think it's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone's anger and confusion surrounding this last week, though this doesn't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously.' She has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication. Her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name, which is set to feature on the Apple Watch. The app gained popularity after Ms Gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life. But after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims, Ms Gibson herself admitted in an interview with The Australian that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver, spleen, blood and uterus was a'misdiagnosis'. Ms Gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her Instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the Whole Pantry Facebook page deleted. 'At the end of the day, I am a human being on the receiving end of comments, questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me, it does not warrant some of the recent responses,' she said. The Whole Pantry was voted Apple\u2019s Best Food and Drink App of 2013 and will feature on the Apple Watch. The technology giant did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Tuesday. She said the social media accounts were 'further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data, information or other security-sensitive content to be shared or made light of. 'My son's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this, so I'm sure you can understand how unnecessary, concerning and threatening that is.' Ms Gibson said the statement she was writing was taking 'longer than anticipated' because of media requests and 'constantly arising issues', 'with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son'. Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they visited an Elwood home last Tuesday evening 'as part of a welfare check.\u00a0They left shortly after with nil concerns.'

Kingfisher also pulled out of a \u00a3200m deal to buy French rival Mr Bricolage due to lack of support from a key shareholder.", "article": "DIY giant B&Q announced today it is to shut one in six of its least profitable stores after its annual profits fell \u00a375million last year. The home improvement chain  is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Shares in Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Changes: B&Q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Parent company Kingfisher, which also owns Screwfix, plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360-strong B&Q estate. The move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to \u00a3675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to \u00a311billion in the year to January 31. This is down from 744million in the 2013-14 year. The planned store closures form part of a plan by new Chief Executive Veronique Laury to shake-up the 360-store B&Q business. Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds  in the year to January 31.The results are the first to be presented by Laury, who succeeded Ian Cheshire in December. Veronique Laury said the closure plan was one of a number of'sharp' decisions being taken by the FTSE 100 company. She added: 'Home improvement is a great market with huge potential and Kingfisher has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way. However, it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential.' Other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company, particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of Kingfisher's operating companies. The company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities. Kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the B&Q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the Screwfix brand, while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business. Ms Laury denied that the UK DIY market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company's UK offer. She added that it had long been clear that B&Q had too many stores in its estate. B&Q UK & Ireland's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to \u00a33.7 billion in the financial year, with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent. Profits were 16 per cent higher at \u00a3276million. In contrast, profits in France were 12 per cent lower at \u00a3349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market. Kingfisher said it will close a small number of stores in the country. It came as Kingfisher, which had a binding agreement to buy French rival Mr Bricolage, was forced to pull out of the \u00a3200m deal. The acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because Kingfisher already owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. While it had the backing of a key shareholder, support was withdrawn by franchisee group the Association Nationale des Promoteurs du Faites Le Vous-M\u00eame (ANPF), which holds a 42pc stake in Mr Bricolage. Forty-four of Mr Bricolage's 500 stores, many of them franchises, would had to have been sold to placate regulators.

Camera assistant Sarah Jones (above) was struck by a fuel tank and run over by the train as she tried to flee and was killed instantly. The film's director Randall Miller (above with wife Jody Savin) pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and will serve two years in prison. The video also shows the crew desperately trying to get a bed off the track, which Hurt was laying on during the scene as they filmed a dream sequence while Russell played the guitar. Russell, the son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, can be seen clearly in the video as he flees with a guitar still on his back. Footage taken just before the tragic incident unfolded was later edited and cut into a scene. It would have been used in the film if production hadn't been stopped. Two weeks ago, the film's director, Randall Miller, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and will serve two years in a county jail and eight years probation while also paying a $20,000 fine. Executive producer Jay Sedrish also pleaded guilty to the same charges and received 10 years probation. 'We hope the sacrifice of our daughter's life will continue to change the film industry,' Jones' father, Richard Jones, told reporters outside the courthouse. 'I believe it sends a message, frankly, that if you do not respect those you're in charge of, you may end up behind bars.' In addition,\u00a0Hillary Schwartz, an assistant director on the film, was also convicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and also received 10 years probation. Charges against Miller's wife and business partner, Jody Savin, were dropped as part of his plea. Prosecutors said all three defendants knew that CSX Transportation, which owned the trestle spanning the Altamaha River, had denied them permission in writing to film on its tracks. 'It was a horrible tragedy that will haunt me forever,' Miller said in a statement provided by a publicist. 'Although I relied on my team, it is ultimately my responsibility and was my decision to shoot the scripted scene that caused this tragedy.' Hurt (above) won the Best Actor Oscar in 1986 for Kiss of the Spider Woman. Assistant District Attorney John B. Johnson said Miller and the other filmmakers even attempted to rewrite the script to drop the scene they planned to shoot with actor William Hurt, in the role of Allman, in a hospital bed placed on the tracks. Miller decided to shoot the scene anyway, Johnson said, after the owner of the property surrounding the tracks said the movie crew could access its land. He said Miller and his crew went onto the railroad bridge after mistakenly thinking no more trains would pass that day. The train, traveling at 55mph, smashed into a metal-framed bed on the tracks, sending shrapnel flying as crew members scrambled for safety and clung to the bridge's metal railing high above the Altamaha River. After his plea was accepted, Miller followed a sheriff's deputy from the courtroom to begin his two-year sentence at the Wayne County jail. He also agreed to serve an additional eight years on probation and pay a $20,000 fine. Miller's attorney, Ed Garland, said he expects the director could be released from jail within a year. He said Miller accepted the plea deal to prevent prosecution of his wife, who left the courthouse in tears. Garland said the filmmaker never intended to put his crew at risk. The crew was filming a dream sequence that featured Hurt, as Allman, on a bed (above) Russell (above) was playing a guitar in the scene, and can be seen carrying it still as he ran from the train.

Asian and Formosan subterranean termites, two of the most destructive termite species on the planet, are could be mating in South Florida. They are producing hybrid colonies of'super termites' that are growing at twice the normal rate. Asian (pictured) and Formosan subterranean termites, two of the most destructive termite species on the planet, are could be mating in South Florida.They are producing hybrid colonies of'super termites' that are growing at twice the normal rate. Together, Asian and Formosan subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. The Formosan termites originated in China but now are established throughout the Southeast and blamed for roughly $300m in property damage each year in New Orleans alone. Asian termites normally found in tropical south-eastern Asia have spread to Brazil, the Caribbean and south Florida. Asian termites are not expected to spread farther north in the US than south Florida because they do not tolerate colder weather/. However, a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone. Their habitat ranges overlap in lush south Florida, already home to a daunting number of invasive plant and animal species thriving where they should not. Each termite invaded Florida several decades ago, but experts believed the colonies didn't mingle because their above ground mating swarms launched in different months. That is, until University of Florida researcher Thomas Chouvenc noticed something unusual about the termite swarms in his Fort Lauderdale neighbourhood two years ago. The two species were flying around looking for mates at the same time \u2013 and they were giving each other that look. The research is preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered, but the idea of a hybrid termite carrying the destructive capabilities of two invasive species worries experts. 'That's big news,' said Matthew Messenger, an entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture. 'They're two bad ones, too.' Chouvenc is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal Plos One detailing observations of Asian and Formosan termite swarms in downtown Fort Lauderdale. In the field, including Chouvenc's own yard, researchers documented the two species swarming at the same time and in the same places. The same behaviour was documented again last year, and Chouvenc said he is seeing again this spring. 'What we didn't expect to see was when they're in the same place at the same time, we saw the male Asian subterranean termites looking for the female Formosan termites in the field,' Chouvenc said. Together, Asian and Formosan (pictured) subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. 'When we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab, to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing.' The resulting 'hybrid' colony in the lab grew more vigorously than colonies produced by either species alone, researchers said. Genetic analysis confirmed they were looking at a hybrid species. Similar hybridisation has been documented in invasive bee and fire ant species, but not in termites. The two termite species also are found together on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and in Taiwan, but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in Florida appear to be a new phenomenon. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale, or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale in the south of Florida. Female termites can lay millions of eggs, but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms. 'Let's keep our fingers crossed that they're not able [to reproduce] and that they're donkey termites,' said Messenger, who reviewed the data but did not participate in the University of Florida study. Even if hybrid termites cannot reproduce, they could cause damage over many years. Alone, each species is a challenge to control. Their below-ground colonies are bigger than those of native termites and can be hard to find. Liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against Asian and Formosan termites, and those methods should work against any hybrid, Messenger said.

Food historian Dr Polly Russell told today's This Morning that in the Fifties, only 20 per cent of women worked, leaving the majority of wives to spend their time cooking, cleaning and managing their households. But in later decades as women swelled the workforce, convenient pre-prepared sandwiches, microwaves and ready meals transformed Britain's kitchens - and its diet. Scroll down for video. Food in the Fifties as illustrated by this display on today's This Morning. Housewives had to feed the family with limited rations. Thanks to households being rationed to one egg per week, cakes like this one, right, had to be made with dried eggs, left, while they were topped with blancmange thanks to the lack of sugar available. The Robshaw family try making a Fifties cake with limited ingredients on BBC show 'Back in Time for Dinner', ably assisted by Mary Berry. She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'We have this idea of the Fifties being a domestic ideal - Mad Men, glamorous - \u00a0this was not the case in Britain, we were still in rationing, very austere. 'It meant there was only one fresh egg a week per household so housewives had to feed the family with these limited rations. 'It's not surprising housewives became fed-up in the Fifties - they spent 75 hours a week doing housework.' 'They had to cope with powdered eggs and a limited amount of variety to cook with.' A new BBC series called\u00a0Back In Time For Dinner challenged a modern family to try reliving what this was like. The Robshaws - father Brandon, mother Rochelle and children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15, and Fred 10 - learnt that rations certainly made birthdays less indulgent. Food historian Dr Polly Russell, pictured, took Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on a trip down memory lane for the taste buds on today's This Morning, showing what was typically eaten from the Fifties to Nineties. The Robshaw family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the Fifties to the Nineties. Pictured, from left to right, Rosalind, 15, mum Rochelle, Fred, 10, dad Brandon and Miranda, 17, in the Fifties episode. Dr Russell invited Amanda and Phillip to try a birthday cake the family made on the show based on a Fifties recipe. She explained: 'A cake had to be made with dry eggs and icing with a blancmange topping because of the lack of sugar.\u00a0' After a taste test, Amanda admitted it was 'dry but not inedible'. Bread and dripping (often leftover fat from the Sunday roast) was a common reality at breakfast time while fresh vegetables were often taken from community allotments. In the Sixties, This Morning illustrated how a typical food spread would include cheese and pineapples on cocktails sticks and corned beef. Dr Russell revealed how this was the decade when kitchens were transformed by technology. She said: 'In the Sixties there was a real rise in disposable incomes and an increase technology in the kitchen. In the Sixties, food became more colourful and decorative, as shown by the cheese and pineapple sticks served on an orange and vibrant table cloth on today's This Morning. The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties. 'The most iconic piece is the fridge but only 50 per cent of households had one by the end of the decade, everyone else used larders. The fridge changed what you could cook.' The food historian added that food at this time became'more about display and what it looks like as well as what it tastes like.' So along with the decorative pineapple and cheese on sticks served attached to an orange, came colourful dishes like vegetable terrines. By the Seventies,\u00a040 per cent of women were working, leading to a rise in the number of convenience foods on offer. Dr Russell explained: 'Now women have less time for cooking so the food industry starts offering help in terms of processed, convenience foods so there are things like Pot Noodles available. 'There's also more branding and colourful packaging to try and persuade people to buy them.' By the Seventies, with more women going out to work, food is becoming more convenient with products like Angel Delight, back left, and ready-made cake mixtures, back right. Arctic rolls and Pot Noodles became popular in the Seventies as people spent less time cooking.

The Guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005. Charles is next in line to the British throne and as King would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality. Some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a \"meddling king,\" attempting to influence politicians. After the judgment was released Thursday, Guardian Editor-in-Chief Alan Rusbridger said the paper was \"delighted\" about the Supreme Court's decision after what he said was a \"brilliant 10-year campaign by Guardian reporter Rob Evans.\" \"The government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters, admitting their publication would'seriously damage' perceptions of the Prince's political neutrality. Now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment,\" Rusbridger said. Max Foster, CNN's royal correspondent, says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne. \"These were private letters, never meant for public consumption, which is why the Prince's office has resisted their release,\" he said. \"But they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy. Should Charles be getting involved in politics at all when, as head of state, he'll be expected to be politically neutral? He's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the judgment was \"disappointing\" and the government would now look at how to release the letters. \"This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough,\" he said. Cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision: \"Our FOI (freedom of information) laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto, which we exercised in this case for a reason. If the legislation does not make Parliament's intentions for the veto clear enough, then we will need to make it clearer.\" The Prince's official residence, Clarence House, issued a brief statement about the decision. \"This is a matter for the government. Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.\" The anti-monarchy group Republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the Freedom of Information Act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk. \"The government must now act to end royal secrecy. Any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret,\" CEO Graham Smith said. \"We can't have a situation where we don't know what influence Charles is having on government policy.\" In a statement issued on the eve of the decision, Smith branded the monarchy one of Britain's \"most secretive institutions.\" \"Charles clearly has his own political agenda, yet his name won't be on the ballot in May. So we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy.\" Evans, the Guardian reporter, had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between Charles and various government departments under the UK's Freedom of Information Act and environmental regulations. After the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests, Evans appealed to the Information Tribunal, which referred the matter to the Upper Tribunal. The Guardian reported in 2009 that Charles had written to Treasury, Foreign Office and Education Department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials. \"The disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king,\" the paper said. The Upper Tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters, \"advocacy correspondence,\" should be disclosed, but its decision was vetoed by Britain's attorney general, who issued a certificate overriding it. Explaining his decision, the attorney general said that in that his view, the correspondence was \"undertaken as part of The Prince of Wales' preparation for becoming King\" and contained nothing that outweighed \"strong public interest against disclosure.\" The Guardian challenged the veto in court, but three high court judges dismissed it, so Evans appealed to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate.", "candidates": [["Previously secret correspondence between Britain's Prince Charles and government officials is to be made public after a Supreme Court ruling.

Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer\u2019s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost \u00a3100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth. Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie\u2019s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: \u2018Of course we wanted to win. But it\u2019s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.\u2019 Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks. ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers, the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over-raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks. Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long-term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers, who are never seen at the races. Arena Racing Company were among many companies hosting their annual drinks at Cheltenham. It doesn\u2019t say much for the commitment to developing homegrown cricket talent that England selector Mike Newell, in his other role as Nottinghamshire\u2019s director of cricket, has signed Zimbabwe batsman Brendan Taylor as a Kolpak player. The 29-year-old has played 23 Tests and 166 ODIs. The move follows another England selector, Middlesex boss Angus Fraser, bringing in New Zealander James Franklin on an Irish passport. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is a guest of the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club at Cheltenham today. But Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to embrace the liquid Festival hospitality as heartily as one of her predecessors did last year. The former minister was barely able to walk through the car parks after the meeting. Minister for Sport Helen Grant, a modest drinker, is unlikely to end up like a predecessor at Cheltenham. LTA back in fat cat mode. LTA chief executive Michael Downey has yet to justify an annual salary and benefits package of \u00a3434,000 plus a massive one-off relocation payment of \u00a3190,000. Nor did the Canadian do his image much good by wearing a GB tracksuit top during last weekend\u2019s Davis Cup triumph over the USA in Glasgow \u2014 a cardinal sin for a sports administrator. LTA chairman David Gregson had said Downey would receive a \u00a3300,000 salary on his appointment but it seems the excesses of the Roger Draper regime are already in danger of being repeated. LTA chief executive Michael Downey was not his usual suited self in Glasgow - he wore a GB tracksuit top. There will be only five more racing days after Saturday before Clare Balding turns her back on presenting the sport following Royal Ascot. But the Balding effect has not boosted Channel 4\u2019s viewing figures \u2014 quite the reverse. The Cheltenham peak of 996,000 was down again on Wednesday, year on year, by 20,000. And the last time Cheltenham enjoyed four consecutive days of 1m-plus ratings was pre-Balding in 2012, when Highflyer produced the coverage and John McCririck, John Francome and Derek Thompson were all still on board. Clare Balding arrives at Cheltenham Festival, but her presence has not helped viewing figures. Only Cheltenham could consider \u00a330,000 for two season tickets in the Cheltenham Club good value. However, 100 of the 300 memberships available for the grand top-floor facility in the new \u00a345million grandstand, which are being sold on a minimum three-year basis, have already been bought.

Shocking pictures showed the angry mob of 2,000 people after they broke into a prison, kidnapped the man, stripped him naked and mercilessly beat him to death in front of a frenzied crowd. The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college on February 24, and he was arrested a day later. Now the alleged rape survivor has spoken out, accusing the lynched man of giving her \u00a350 to not tell anyone about the attack. Scroll down for video. Furious: Several thousand people gathered as the man (pictured, top) accused of raping a girl last month was mercilessly beaten to death. Lynched: The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death. It is unclear whether he is dead in this shocking image. Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later. Offer: The woman says that the man offered her \u00a350 to keep quiet about the alleged attack. Speaking anonymously to a local TV station, the woman said:\u00a0'The accused person was my neighbour. 'It was only after the incident...he told me,\u00a0he gave me the money to keep silent...I took the money and gave it at the police station.' The pictures showed the mob after they overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man. According to local media reports, he died while being dragged four miles through the streets as people beat and pelted him with stones. It was reported that the crowd tore down two gates before dragging him to the town's clock tower. It was said they also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Several people were injured when police used batons and opened fire, while officers were hurt when the mob pelted them with stones in Nagaland state in northeast India. A 25-year-old believed to be part of the mob was injured when police opened fire and he later died in hospital. The police later removed the man's body. Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express. Protesters: A mass rally was held in Dimapur by those who oppose the rape of a student last month. But the family of the lynched man have maintained his innocence and say the medical report of the rape complainant proves that she was not sexually assaulted. The man has been named by Indian media as Syed Sarif Uddin Khan and his brother Jamal said the killing was 'politically motivated' and accused police of 'falsely implicating his brother on behest of Naga groups, who want to root out non-tribals from the state'. Nagaland's indigenous tribal groups, especially the largest Naga tribe, have for years accused the growing population of Bengali-speaking Muslims from nearby Assam state and Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and usurping resources. Nagas have previously campaigned to evict Bengali-speaking immigrants from their territory, who they claim entice local girls into marriage for getting tribal status. Jamaluddin, an Indian army sergeant, accused Nagaland's government of 'deliberately dubbing him as a Bangladeshi... to justify the killing'. 'The girl's medical report didn't confirm rape but still my brother was jailed and then handed over to the mob who lynched him just because he was a Bengali-speaking person. 'There are multiple members of our family serving in the Army. How could they have killed him claiming he was Bangladeshi? My brother was made a scapegoat.' Police had initially claimed that the man was an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant. 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it. India is in midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student. The incident, which sparked outrage both in India and around the world, highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the country. The Indian government has also asked YouTube to block access to the documentary, claiming that its broadcast violated certain key agreements with the filmmaker. But the Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch the documentary, which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. The documentary, called 'India's Daughter', was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack.

{"abstract": "Saudi Arabia and its allies have launched airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran. The airstrikes are part of a military operation called al-Hazm Storm, which aims to support the ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The US is supporting the operation through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, but will not be sending any military forces.", "article": "(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,\" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said \"there will be no military intervention by the U.S.\" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, \"If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us.\" He added, \"We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner.\" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. \"This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,\" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called \"the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \"We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue (that includes) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis,\" the Iraqi ministry said. The Houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in Yemen. In addition to airstrikes, the Saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in Yemen. Just a day in, the coalition airstrikes are already costing the Houthis. Hundreds of explosions ripped through Sanaa overnight, said journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital. The Health Ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in Sanaa, the Houthi-run Saba news agency said. While Sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the Houthis' combat and control operations there, the Saudi adviser said -- it wasn't the only place struck. Compounds and military installations in Saada and Taiz also were targeted. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. The military operation, dubbed al-Hazm Storm, was launched after the Houthis rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said in a speech Thursday. It was done in accord with a joint Arab defense treaty, al-Arabi said. Specifically, the strikes aim to support Hadi, who was ousted in January after talks with the Houthis faltered, but still claims to be Yemen's rightful leader. \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, in announcing the beginning of the military campaign. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be an option for us or for our coalition partners.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Jubeir told CNN's \"The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer\" that Saudi Arabia was concerned that the Houthis had control over Yemen's armed", "candidates": [["Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war.

Twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately England finished six points adrift of the total they needed as Ireland claimed the title for the second season running. England could barely have done any more but were punished for a second-half lapse of discipline which saw James Haskell sin binned for tripping and France scored two tries. 'We're absolutely devastated,' said man-of-the-match Ben Youngs, who scored two tries. 'For all our endeavour, we fell short. We're gutted.' Ireland's crushing victory over Scotland at Murrayfield earlier in the afternoon left England with a huge mountain to climb. England began the game knowing they must win by the unlikely margin of 26 points to win the first championship of Lancaster's tenure. It was always going to be a huge ask against a French side that, for all its faults, had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this Twickenham clash. Suddenly, the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around England's throat. Lancaster had recalled experienced Leicester lock Geoff Parling in place of Dave Attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against Scotland last Saturday. Parling's Leicester team-mate Dan Cole led his side out on his 50th cap and England knew they would need a titanic set-piece performance, first and foremost, to stand a realistic chance of pulling off a stunning championship win.

The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50% last year. The suspects in both shootings were found dead, either from self-inflicted gunshot wounds or from being shot by law enforcement officers.", "article": "(CNN)They died in separate shootings. Separated by more than 2,000 miles, they lived with the peril and uncertainty that hundreds of thousands of U.S. law enforcement officers face each day. One was a 14-year veteran; the other a rookie on his first day out on his own. Two law enforcement officers, one in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and another in San Jose, California, were shot and killed in encounters with suspects Tuesday. Such encounters are all too common. The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50% last year, according to the Washington-based National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. \"Officers were obviously crying, grieving,\" said Officer Alberto Morales, a San Jose police department spokesman.\"They will do so for some time, as will many of us in the department.\" They were grieving for San Jose police Officer Michael Johnson, a veteran killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. The suspect in the San Jose shooting was found dead on his balcony with a gunshot wound, authorities said. Thousands of miles away, officers grieved the shooting death of Wisconsin State Trooper Trevor Casper, 21, of Kiel, according to the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The suspect  -- a suspected bank robber -- was killed. Casper had successfully completely his field training recently. He was on his first solo assignment, Capt. Anthony Burrell told reporters Wednesday. It's unclear whether the suspects were fatally shot by law enforcement officers or died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Johnson, a veteran, was killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. Part of his job was to work with new officers. Police received a call Tuesday evening about a \"despondent, intoxicated man, who possibly had access to a weapon, including a rifle,\" said San Jose police Chief Larry Esquivel. When officers arrived at the scene, they were met with gunfire, said Esquivel, adding that investigators were still trying \"to understand what truly happened.\" Johnson was the first San Jose officer killed in the line of duty in 14 years. The last officer killed in the line of duty, Jeffrey Fontana, was in the same academy graduating class, Esquivel said. \"It's unfortunate for any of our officers to lose their lives, whether it's that class or any class,\" he said. It's not known whether the suspect was wounded in the exchange of gunfire, the police chief said. \"SJPD grieves as we offer our condolences to the family of our brother,\" the police department tweeted. Morales said the death had shaken many officers. \"Our hearts, prayers go out with the family of Michael, our brother. This is a very, very difficult time right now.\" He remembered Johnson's smile and bright eyes, how he was \"full of life and cared a lot about his job.\" \"It's a tough thing to relay to your fellow officers who have to go out there to continue to do this job,\" Morales said. \"But rest assured, that we will keep him in our memories as we go out there and continue to do the job that we love to do, and I'm sure he loved to do.\" In  Wisconsin, Casper was killed after chasing a bank robbery suspect in Fond du Lac, authorities said. He had been sworn in as a state trooper in December, according to media reports and a Facebook page dedicated to his memory. \"Trevor Casper was a lively young man,\" Burrell recalled. \"He was very excited about his opportunity to be a trooper... He always had a smile on his face. When we met several times, I always asked if he was having fun and his response was, 'I sure am,' with a smile on his face.\" Gunfire rang out when the trooper was pursuing a car that matched the description of one used in a bank robbery, CNN affiliate WITI-TV in Milwaukee reported. The suspect, identified as Steven Timothy Snyder, also died, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice. No other details of the pursuit were available. Police believe the suspect may have shot and killed a man in his 60s after leaving the bank, the station reported. Authorities are not looking for any additional suspects. Lt. Col. Brian Rahn of the Wisconsin State Patrol said the rookie officer's handling of the fatal encounter was \"absolute textbook -- from the time he made contact with the vehicle until the event was over.\" The Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation will conduct an investigation, a requirement for officer-involved shootings in the state. \"Our son Trevor was an amazing young man who from a young age would do anything to help anyone,\" the trooper's family said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"It did not surprise us when he selected a career in law enforcement. Even as a young child he was always helping others. Trevor had a soft and good heart.

Senior Tories are pushing for the first significant rise in the threshold to be made next year if the party wins the election. The number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million to five million since 2010, as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by Labour. In a speech at a school in West London yesterday, the Prime Minister yesterday pledged to start easing the pressure on middle class families. He said: \u2018We will raise the threshold at which people start paying the 40p rate of tax. This rate was only ever meant for the better off.

The Juventus striker uploaded an Instagram post to his account on Tuesday posing in his own customised snapback hat.

Carlos Tevez has posted an Instagram picture on Tuesday showing off his customised snapback. Manchester City's\u00a0infamous 'Welcome to Manchester' poster (pictured) appears to be referenced on the hat. Tevez's time at City also seems to be referenced along the peak of the hat - with the Etihad outfit's infamous 'Welcome to Manchester' poster depicted in white upon the black background. While the hat may not be easy on the eye to some, the same couldn't be said for Tevez's free-kick in their 1-1 draw at Roma on Monday night. The forward's beautifully-curled effort gave Juve the lead at their Serie A titles rivals in the second half. Speaking after the match, Tevez admitted he had learned how to become a dead-ball specialist from club team-mate Andrea Pirlo. 'I copied [Andrea] Pirlo,' he told the Gazetta dello Sport. 'I watch him every day in training and tried to copy him. 'But when he returns, he will take them again. He is a specialist and I have to respect that.'

A bookkeeper stole almost \u00a32million from his employers and used some of the money to buy a plot of land in Scotland - complete with an aristocratic title. Julian Kremer, 49, admitted fiddling the books at the estate agency he worked for in Wokingham, Berkshire, and used most of the cash to fund an internet gambling habit, a court heard. Five members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents were made redundant due to the losses while the company fell into financial ruin. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get'. Prosecutor Jane Davies told the court Kremer's crimes came to light on January 31, 2013, after the salaries of two employees had not been paid. She said: 'Steven Jones, the company director, made inquiries about the balances in five of the company accounts because it was believed the balances were not as they should have been.' The court heard he had altered the figures on at least two of the accounts to an inflated sum to make them look higher than they were. He was confronted by staff and admitted taking \u00a31.9 million over a four and a half year period, from July 2008 to January 2013, and spent more than \u00a3630,000 on gambling. Mr Recorder Martin Heslop QC said: 'One of the gambling companies described him as their best customer.' Credit card bills showed payments exceeding \u00a34,000 a month and some of the cash was spent on hotels. He also bought a small plot of land in Scotland which meant he could use the title Laird Julian Kremer and he asked for his personal details to be altered to reflect the name change. Company director, Steven Jones, who runs the company under the names Richard Worth Ltd, Richard Worth Residential Ltd and Richard Worth Holdings Ltd, told the court he had known Kremer for almost 20 years. Miss Davies said: 'Kremer stole around \u00a3250,000 a year and told Mr Jones cash flow was not improving due to debts. 'After the discovery, Mr Jones did everything he could to minimise financial ruin for the company. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court (pictured) on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get' 'He had to borrow \u00a3250,000 personally and made redundant five members of staff. He took on a \u00a31million debt which will take many years to repay. 'The business was the bedrock of his retirement planning and he doubts he will ever recover from the financial disaster.' Defending, Llewellyn Sellick said Mr Jones had sold the letting limb of the business and the other was still trading. He told the court: 'He is of hitherto good character, he accepts this involves a very large sum. He made an immediate confession to his employers and he repeated this when he was arrested. 'He now has nothing. He was heavily addicted to gambling and had to sell his \u00a3400,000 house. 'By the 1990s, he had lost three of his grandparents and his mother's brother. His brother Simon was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2004 aged 41.' Kremer separated from his wife in 2007 and has been in a civil marriage with his now husband since 2011. Mr Sellick said: 'He knows he has to be punished. I ask that you impose a sentence that will not crush him entirely.' The court heard Kremer, formerly from Wokingham, and now living in Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to one count of theft from an employer in January. Kremer admitted altering figures to make them look higher than they were and his crimes only came to light after there was not enough money to pay two members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents in Wokingham. Jailing him for five years, Mr Recorder Heslop said: 'This case paints a sad picture of a man of previous good character. 'There are severe financial and personal consequences for those who suffered as a result of this theft. A suspended prison sentence is, I am afraid, wholly inappropriate. 'This was a professional, sophisticated and at times extremely clever and deliberate theft involving fraud, forgery and misrepresentation to those for whom you worked and it is a theft on a very significant scale carried out over a substantial period of time. 'The total sum is \u00a31,981,936 and this is as bad a case as one could imagine. It is quite clear the money went on gambling. 'There is also evidence of high living.

Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the June 7 accident that saw a Wal-Mart 18-wheeler hit a limo carrying Morgan and his friend. Their lawyer Daryl Zaslow will take a $3million cut, according to court papers. Scroll down for video. The family of comedian James McNair, (left and right) who was the mentor to 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan received a reported $10million payout from Wal-Mart. Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the accident on June 7. Zaslow wrote that he was 'able to convince Wal-Mart' that the hefty settlement would outweigh any potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicized lawsuit, according to a filing obtained by\u00a0DNAinfo. He said the $10million settlement was a 'truly outstanding result,' especially because McNair's past income was not large enough  for his children to 'project a significant lost-wage claim'. According to DNAinfo, McNair, who was 62 at the time of his death, worked part-time at the Salvation Army when he wasn't doing stand-up gigs. The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. But the amount was revealed in legal documents filed last month in Westchester Surrogate's Court. Denita, 19, wrote in an affidavit included in the filing that 'no amount of money could replace' her father, but that the settlement 'greatly exceeds anything I imagined and I could not be more grateful.' When the settlement was first announced in January, Zaslow said Walmart had 'accepted their responsibility' in the crash. 'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' he said. 'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.' He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.' James McNair was killed when the limo van he was traveling in was struck by an 18-wheeler on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7. Zaslow wrote that he was 'able to convince Wal-Mart' that the hefty settlement would outweigh potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicizing lawsuit. The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the superstore to admit no liability for the crash. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident. 'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.' Kevin Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey. The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash. In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash. Morgan, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash, has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart.

Amos Yee, a moppy-haired teenager posted an online video peppered with expletives that slammed the late leader, who died last week, as a \"horrible person\" and \"undoubtedly totalitarian.\" He also made comments comparing Lee to Jesus Christ and Mao Zedong. Lee, highly revered in Singapore was buried Sunday with thousands gathering in a massive state funeral service. While admired for his role turning the former British colony into a financial power house, Lee was also criticized for tamping down on free speech in Singapore. On the day of Lee's funeral, Yee was arrested after Singapore police said it received more than 20 reports regarding his video, which police said contained \"disparaging remarks against Christians.\" That YouTube video has since been removed. Critics say Yee's arrest highlights the restrictions on free speech in Singapore. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for the teen's immediate release. Yee faces three charges: intent to wound the religious feelings of any person; circulating obscene objects; and making threatening and abusive or insulting communications. He could face up to three years in prison. Deputy Commissioner of Police Tan Chye Hee said: \"Police take a stern view of acts that could threaten religious harmony in Singapore.

Jason Taylor, 21, shared an eight-month relationship with Jodie Emery, 26, but after the pair broke up he became jealous, often going to her house in\u00a0Preston, Lancashire, to spy on her. Convinced she was seeing another man he sent the mother-of-two a text on September 22 last year which said: 'Last chance, otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there'. He then went to Miss Emery's home and kicked in the front door. With her two young daughters asleep upstairs he began fighting with friend Adam Wilson, 25, who she said had been invited over for drinks. Jason Taylor, 21 (left), is facing life in jail today after he was found guilty of murdering Adam Wilson, 25, after becoming convinced he was dating his ex-girlfriend Jodie Emery, 26 (right) During the struggle he used a knife he had bough on a previous holiday with Miss Emery to fatally stab Mr Wilson in the thigh. During his trial at Preston Crown Court, Taylor tried to claim that that there was no innocent reason for Mr Wilson being in the house, and denied intending to kill him, but a jury took just an hour and a half to decide he was lying. Today he was handed down a life sentence and told he cannot apply for parole until at least 2040. Judge Anthony Russell QC told Taylor: 'The victim was someone completely unknown to you and had done you absolutely no harm at all and yet was murdered by you for no other reason other than he happened to be the person at the home of Jody Emery. 'This was a particularly shocking murder because it was pure chance Adam Wilson was the person who you vented your rage on because you were unable to accept your relationship with Jody Emery was finished. 'People have to accept that sometimes things go wrong in their lives and relationship do sometimes end. You were not prepared to accept that. Taylor kicked down Miss Emery's front door on September 22 last year, and began fighting with Mr WIlson (pictured), fatally stabbing him in the thigh. 'You persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance. 'You were not prepared to let her move along with her life or yours because of your obsessive jealousy. She was perfectly entitled to see other people, it was none of your business if she did so. 'You murdered this man for no other reason other than he was in a place he was perfectly entitled to be. He had done no wrong.' The court earlier heard that Taylor, a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses, had been in an eight-month relationship with Miss Emery. The pair had shared a caravan holiday together in Scarborough, but after they returned home Miss Emery secretly terminated a pregnancy. When Taylor found out he flew into a rage and the pair split. Unable to accept the break-up Taylor began texting and calling Miss Emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together, and often went to her house to watch her, often coming up to look through the windows. Two days before the murder took place Taylor was at pub\u00a0the Tardy Gate. When he spotted one of Miss Emery's former boyfriends he became angry, smashed a window and tried to punch the man. Louise Blackwell QC said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery saying: 'I miss you. Maybe in time you'll want to try again'. She asked him not to contact her but later that evening he sent her another text saying: 'Can I come for cuddles?' Miss Emery responded, 'you being weird then', to which he said: 'I'm not my head is just f..ked' and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during his holiday with Miss Emery. The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with. She texted back, 'on my own I keep telling you' at which point Taylor said: 'last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance'. Emery replied 'wtf' and tried to call him three times with no response. Miss Blackwell added: 'The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. 'Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge. 'Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop.

The NHS is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants. Doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims, drug addicts, and those with infections under new plans (file picture) And one of the plans reportedly been considered is offering patients transplants using organs from people who would have usually had them rejected after being deemed to 'high-risk'. According to the Sunday Times, the proposals would create a special 'fast track' waiting list for the high risk organs. Dr Titus Augustine, director of transplantation at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told the newspaper: 'One of the things that we have been looking at is trying to match risk with risk. 'There are people on the lost who are willing to take that risk, accept kidneys from people with known infection risk or cancer risk.' Organs are deemed high risk if they come from cancer patients, intravenous drug users and those with a history of having high-risk sex lives. However, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust have said they rejected a research proposal looking into high-risk organ donation. A spokesperson said: 'The Trust submits hundreds of research proposals and applications for funding every year. 'This was an application for funding for a research project looking in to offering patients at risk of dying without transplantation organs considered high risk. 'This proposal was rejected by the funding body and therefore will not be progressing any further.' Darren Hughes, 42, left, and Robert Stuart, 67, right, both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis-causing parasitic worms. Last year, it emerged that at least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved \u2018high-risk\u2019 organs that could be damaged or infected. Figures obtained from NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority which oversees donations, show that last year, 333 patients were given high-risk organs. This represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts, cancer sufferers or those aged over 71. The 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers, the obese or the very sexually active who may have HIV or other infections. But Bryon Jaques, who worked for Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals before emigrating to Australia, warned the NHS drive to increase donations was flawed. It comes after it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm. The relatives of Darren Hughes, 42, and grandfather Robert Stuart, 67, say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) in 2013 and died within three weeks. The organs belonged to a 39-year-old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in England and Scotland before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Birmingham and Edinburgh from accepting his kidneys. Mr Jaques, who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist, said: \u2018We were regularly offered donors that I considered to be very high risk. We were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis (blood infection). \u2018I was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer, which has a high risk of transmission. \u2018We were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure. The vast majority of transplants that do take place in the UK are successful and that\u2019s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community.

Casciaro believes that Scotland and Ireland will be in a battle for third place in their group behind Poland and Germany.", "article": "As the scorer of Gibraltar\u2019s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night. However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium. If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane\u2019s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip. Gibraltar's players celebrate after Lee Casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on Sunday. Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar\u2019s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye. His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden. For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida. Casciaro (centre) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in Gibraltar. \u2018It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,\u2019 he beamed. \u2018It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It\u2019s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar. \u2018I don\u2019t think I will get a hero\u2019s reception when I get home. We still lost the game \u2013 but it is still an achievement to get the goal. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba celebrates the goal at Hampden Park, which levelled the score at 1-1. \u2018We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we\u2019ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch. \u2018Even two or three years ago I didn\u2019t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn\u2019t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day. \u2018This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling. \u2018I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I\u2019m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.\u2019 Casciaro (right) vies for the ball with Scotland's Ikechi Anya, who he later swapped shirts with. Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan\u2019s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team. \u2018I would think we have shown that we are not,\u2019 he said. \u2018We are improving and we do try to play football, which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group. We try to create a good game for the spectators to watch.\u2019 Last June, the first-ever winning goal scored by the British overseas territory - with a 30,000-population comparable with Wishaw - was slotted home in a 1-0 friendly win over Malta in Portugal. That night the history-maker was Kyle Casciaro, Lee\u2019s brother, who was an unused substitute on Sunday. A third brother, Ryan, played in defence for Gibraltar at Hampden in front of proud parents Henry and Helen. Lee Casciaro's brother Ryan, who also plays for the national team, shares a joke with Steven Fletcher. \u2018I\u2019m keeping it in the family,\u2019 smiled Lee. \u2018My mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today. We have to go to Faro in Portugal to play our home games, but they have always been there for us. It is thanks to them that we are here. It is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level.

The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced last night by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shiite militias to spare civilians. Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against the Tikrit area's mainly Sunni population. Scroll down for video. Attack: Volunteer Shiite fighters, who are supporting the Iraqi government forces in the fight against the Islamic State group fire a howitzer artillery canon in the village of Awaynat near the city of Tikrit. Irregulars: Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite fighters chant slogans as they gather at Udhaim dam, north of Baghdad, ahead of an advance on Islamic State positions Tikrit that is expected to begin today. Feeding the soul: Soldiers and irregulars take a moment to pray as Iraq masses its forces outside the city, which was the birthplace of Saddam Hussein and an important step on the road to the IS-held city of Mosul. Feeding the body: Fighters scoff their rations ahead of the attack. It is feared the mainly Shiite forces of the Iraqi government could attack the area's mainly Sunni population, worsening sectarian divisions. On social media, Mr Abadi called 'for utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property' in the city, which was last year the scene of a brutal massacre of hundreds of mainly Shiite Iraqi army recruits. Government forces have been working their way north in recent months, notching up key victories against IS. But Tikrit, which has resisted them several times, is their toughest target yet. 'Security forces are advancing on three main fronts towards Tikrit, Ad-Dawr (to the south) and Al-Alam (to the north),' a senior army officer on the ground told AFP by telephone. The army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army, police, counter-terrorism units, a government-controlled volunteer group known as the Popular Mobilisation units and local Sunni tribes opposed to IS. 'The attack is being carried out using fighter jets, helicopters and artillery targeting Tikrit to secure the advance and cut supply routes,' he said. Military sources said Iraqi warplanes were involved but it was not immediately clear whether foreign air support - Iranian or from the US-led coalition fighting IS - was also called in. According to both Iraqi and Iranian media, Qassem Suleimani - supremo of the elite Iranian Quds force, specialising in'subversive warfare' - was in Salaheddin province to help coordinate operations. Massing: Iraqi Army and volunteer fighters prepare at Sedull Udeyim region before moving into Tikrit. Good morale: Iraqi forces have notched up key victories against IS as they've inched north in recent weeks. Religion: A soldier walks past a line of armoured cars, one of which has a photo of a cleric in the window. Cavalry: Iraqi armoured personnel carriers are lined up ahead of the attack on Tikrit today. Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shiite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions. Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shiite majority. Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq. 'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night. Hadi al-Ameri, the Popular Mobilisation commander, appealed to Tikrit residents on Saturday to leave their homes within 48 hours so government forces could 'wrap up the battle of the revenge for Speicher.' Speicher is a military base near Tikrit from which hundreds of new, mostly Shiite, recruits were kidnapped before being executed last summer, as the Islamic State insurgency took control of much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland. Shiite militias in particular have vowed to avenge the Speicher executions, sparking fears of mass killings against Sunnis if Tikrit were to be recaptured. Mr Abadi appealed to residents to turn against the jihadists, who have suffered a string of military losses since a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations stepped up their support for Iraq's embattled government. 'I call on all those who were misled and made mistakes in the past to lay down their arms today. This may be the last chance,' Mr Abadi said, suggesting some could be granted amnesty.

Above, police at the scene. Seconds before the incident, the driver had struck a Subaru, which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police told\u00a0CBS New York. Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the wall of a building.

Joe Alridge, 36, is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, as well as the Shrivers. Aldridge, who took his own life in his pickup truck on Friday morning, was described as a recluse by those in the town. It was known in the town that Aldridge's family and the Shrivers had been feuding for years, a resident of nearby Summersville told Daily Mail Online. The Shrivers were described as a hard-working clan that owned businesses including construction, cabinet making and cattle farming projects since 1969. Darrell Shriver's wife Martha, 67, was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. She is expected to survive. 'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' John Shriver said. The elder Shriver discovered the bodies of Carey and Valirea after getting a call to check on them from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star. The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his older, college-aged sister. He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'. The shooter is thought to have killed his cousin Garold Dee Aldridge, (center left) 52, and his wife\u00a0Julie Ann Aldridge, (right) 47. The motive for the gunman killing his cousin Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife\u00a0Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, is unknown. The Shrivers were described as a hardworking family that owned several businesses. Above, Carey and Valirea with their daughter.

Authorities identified the four other victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold. John Shriver was unsure about why the killer would target his own family members, according to the\u00a0Associated Press.

They are likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car, and have also visited motels in each of the 48 states and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels.", "article": "A Michigan couple has completed a quest to visit all 3,108 counties in the lower 48 states after driving around the country in a green 1999 Dodge Intrepid for almost nine years. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to Nantucket in their car, which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles. They can now navigate small towns and state highway systems without any help after they accumulated knowledge about how the country is set up, the couple told Daily Mail Online. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl, 32 and 31, completed their journey to the lower 48 states' 3,108 counties when they arrived in Nantucket, their last county, with their green 1999 Dodge Intrepid. They have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006, though the Riehls bought a GPS device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the US where the streets aren't labelled. Jennifer Riehl, 32, a research scientist at Michigan Technological University, and her husband, 31, an engineering instructor at the institution, typically drove about 50,000 miles a year. Jonathan, who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates, hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are 'genuinely baffled' by the accomplishment. Mr Riehl bought the car as a high school senior living in New Jersey for $9,000. At the time, 2002, it had 70,000 miles. The couple met in 2005 and have had their share of adventures since, including meeting a bear and running into nasty weather, according to\u00a0The Cape Cod Times. The car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties, and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16-hour days on the road. They think a 15,000-mile trip from New Jersey to Alaska to their home on Michigan's Upper Peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car. First counties visited by the couple, which met in upstate New York, include many Northeastern destinations where they visited friends. Jonathan, who works with geographical information science computer programs, saw that they had visited a fair number of counties together and during childhood road trips. A move to Nashville, Tennessee, for two years, sparked the idea that they could actually hit all the counties. The contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties, and the addition of Alaska and Hawaii brings the total to 3,143. The couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on Tuesday during their spring break trip. Above, pictured in Plymouth, Mass on Wednesday. The couple has already visited some boroughs of Alaska, but plans on finishing the state and starting on Hawaii. Jennifer's mother lives in Texas, but the travelers don't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit. They have spent days going to the southern state by route of California or Idaho, most recently picking up five counties they had missed in the Gem State during previous journeys. Their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. With academic schedules, the pair has gone to most of the thousands of counties during breaks from school, including winter holidays where they truck through snow. Jonathan proposed to Jennifer on a 2011 trip to Manitoba, Canada, where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three Mexican states. However, their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to Winnepeg in blinding snow with Jennifer keeping track of the road's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove. The couple often taken the long route to friends' and relatives' houses, going from Michigan to Texas via California or Idaho. The car, which Jonathan bought in 2002, still has the same engine. The couple avoids the interstate and uses small and dirt roads when possible. Above, Jennifer stands in Golden Valley County, Montana, in 2012. Oscar Voss of the nonprofit national Extra Miler Club, a travel group where the Riehls are members, says that the couple is likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car. The club lists 38 people who have 'bagged' all 3,143 counties in the entire US, the first being Ed Dietz and Arthur Palmer in 1976. Most of the people who have been to all the counties are over 60, according to the club's Valerie Naylor. The Riehls said that all members of the club go around the country with different goals, such as visiting national parks or climbing to the highest points. Jonathan and Jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can. Jonathan is particularly interested in architecture and Jennifer likes to hike all over the country.

The iconic sportswear company teamed up with Japanese fashion label Sacai for the eight-piece NikeLab x Sacai\u00a0capsule collection, which the brand debuted last month, but many women were left outraged by the impractical pieces, a majority of which retail for $200 or more. 'Nike called it a \u201cbold expression of femininity\". In reality, it\u2019s comical and insulting to female athletes everywhere,' writer Megan Wiegand said in a piece for\u00a0Slate. Scroll down for video. Female athletics: Nike's collaboration with Japanese fashion label Sacai resulted in an eight-piece collection featuring billowy tops and pleated skirts. Not right: Critics of the 'feminine' sportswear line took to social media to air their grievances with the brand's impractical designs. Peppy look: This model was snapped running in a sweatsuit from the collection, which features a peplum back. She later added: 'The Sacai collection is undoubtedly a vanity project for Nike, but its premise - that female athletes prize style and appearance over functionality and performance - is completely tone-deaf.' Others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated, billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity. 'Seriously, that Nike women's line is HIDEOUS. Women's athletic wear needs improving, but this is NOT an improvement. Capes? Dresses? WTF! (sic)' one commenter wrote on Twitter. New wings: The billowy fabric on these pieces from the line can be seen flowing in the as the model runs forward. Not a fan: This commenter tweeted that the entire collection was 'horrifying' Party out back: This jacket looks normal in the front but features plenty of pleated fabric from behind. Bizarre pairing: This royal blue sweatshirt and skirt combination features matching transparent pleats and a hint of hunter green. Another woman tweeted: 'Ew. Yeah, that new Nike women's fashion line is a miss.' Someone else joked that the skirt-filled collection: 'Looks very practical.' However, Sacai\u2019s founder Chitose Abe explained on Nike's website that wearability was a significant consideration in her designs. Surprise detail: \u00a0This sweatshirt has a cut-out in the back that showcases a transparent camisole-like top. Impractical design: This Twitter user joked that the NikeLab x Sacai collection is perfect as long as you are not trying to work out. High-tech: The back of this sweatshirt is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed. Not a fan: This commenter simply said 'ew' after seeing the brand's latest designs. Proud artist: Sacai\u2019s founder Chitose Abe posed next a model who was wearing her designs for Nike. 'The idea of functionality is important to me, as is fabric innovation, which has always been at the heart of Sacai,' Ms Abe said. 'For me, Nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core. It has been inspiring to work together.' Indeed, Ms Abe claims that the flamboyant-looking fabrics and over-the-top embellishments on each of the designs has been added in order to enhance the performance of the athlete. The back of one sweatshirt, for example, is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed by Abe and the brand. 'The garments come to life as the wearer walks and moves, expressing both beauty and strength. We feel it\u2019s a perfect marriage between sport and style,' Kurt Parker, VP/Creative Director, Nike Sportswear, said on the site. Pricey sweats: Many of the pieces in the collection, including this sweatshirt and skirt, retail for $200 or more. Pants free: This critic joked that the collection's many pleated skirts looked'very practical' Interesting accessories: The line's pleated skirts were paired with fishnet knee high socks that are not for sale. Odd couple: This simple black Nike T-shirt was pairs with this tearaway skirt design. And not everyone is disgusted by the collection. When Sacai shared photos of the designs on its Instagram page earlier this week, many of the label's fashion fans had positive comments about the collaboration. 'Sporty clothes I can get into,' one person wrote. Another commenter wrote: 'Love the skirt!'

This is nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in 1985.

Colleen Ann Harris, whose case is expected to open on Wednesday, is accused of shooting dead her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013. Decades before, in 1985, she shot dead her first husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her. Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it. Accused: Colleen Ann Harris, left, is about to go on trial for the 2013 death of her husband, Bob Harris, right, whom she shot dead nearly 30 years after she shot dead her first husband. 'In each case, she kills her husband in the bedroom. In each case, she uses a shotgun,' said El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander, wrote in court papers, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'In each case, she is going through marital difficulties. In each case, she delays reporting the crime... In each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense.' She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her. She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia. The prosecution told a very different tale. They claimed she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense. She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office. Scene: She allegedly shot him dead in the couple's Placerville, California home (pictured) as they were going through marital problems. They had separated but he had returned to care for her after surgery. The jury ultimately said there was insufficient evidence that she intended to murder her husband and she was acquitted of murder. Then in 1990, she married Bob Harris, who had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later. Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported. When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out. But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her. 'My dad, bless his heart, was there taking care of Colleen despite whatever circumstances were going on between them,' his son Andy Harris told the Sacramento Bee. Then on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors claim. She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage. After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office. Harris, who married Colleen in 1990 despite her previous case, left behind two sons and a daughter, right. Beloved: He worked in the Forest Service\u00a0and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband. Mr Harris' family said they remain devastated by the loss. 'The death of your father is devastating enough,' Andy Harris said. 'And then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member. 'There is a real sense of betrayal and wondering if this person had the capacity to love.' His father had worked with the Forest Service for 30 years before retiring in 1997, according to his obituary. He umpired baseball, from Little League to semi-professional teams, and worked as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. A judge has ruled that prosecutors may talk about the first case in the upcoming trial. Attorney Eric Schlueter had fought the decision, saying in court papers: 'The prior incident has ZERO relevance to the current action especially in light of the fact that Mrs. Harris was ACQUITTED of the charge.'", "candidates": [["Colleen Ann Harris, 72, is set to go on trial for the 2013 death of her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband.

However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At \u00a31.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon. Marketed as the Yowk -'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven. Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk. Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.'

These slugs, which grow up to six inches long, are more aggressive than native slugs and can devour garden plants. It is too early to tell how much of a problem native slugs will be this year, but gardeners should be prepared to fight larger numbers of slugs.", "article": "Giant \u2018cannibal\u2019 slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across Britain, experts have warned. Two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs - an horrific, aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory. The species, nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives, was first spotted in this country in 2012. The giant Spanish slug, pictured, was first spotted in the UK in 2012 and is now starting to take hold. Sightings have since been reported in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, London and Hampshire. But this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further. Dr Ian Bedford, the expert who first identified the species three years ago, warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters. \u2018If this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before May we could see very high numbers of the Spanish slug this year,\u2019 he said. Dr Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said the slug - which officially is called Arion vulgaris and originates in southern Europe - cannot survive extreme cold temperatures. Common native slugs, although less aggressive, are much better at surviving cold conditions. Experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year, because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes. The winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps, blizzards and frosts, which hit the new population of Spanish slugs hard. But the intervening two winters have been much warmer, particularly in southern England which has barely seen any snow in 24 months. The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C (39.9F), and the year before was even warmer at 5.8C (42.4F). The average English winter temperature is 4.2C (39.6F). Slug expert Dr Ian Bedford, pictured, said Britain was on course for record numbers of Spanish slugs. The slug, pictured, is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions. The Spanish slugs, which are thought to have made it to the British mainland on imported vegetables, have been recorded feeding on dead mice, meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets. They also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners. Unlike native species, they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them. They also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs, so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly. Dr Bedford said: \u2018If you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water, add a bit of household bleach, and then bury the remains 18 inches deep. \u2018If they spread it could really affect British farmers. We found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs. \u2018If we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year.\u2019 Anna Platoni, entomologist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year. \u2018Although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity, it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important, rather than over the winter,\u2019 she said. \u2018They tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather.\u2019 Sarah Fuller, marketing director at Wyevale Garden Centres added: \u2018Slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners, making this hobby and pastime a true 24-hour activity. \u2018Last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month. \u2018It\u2019s likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods.\u2019", "candidates": [["Experts have warned that two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs to expand their territory.

According to accident investigators at the time, the service was en-route to Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, from Paris with stops in Nice, Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan and India. However, the plane encountered stormy weather over the French Alps with residents in the small village of Fours St. Laurent reporting seeing the aircraft crash into the mountainside and burst into flames.

A similar model crashed in the French Alps in 1953 less than a mile from the doomed Germanwings aircraft yesterday. Famous French violinist Jacques Thibaud, who was killed in the Air France crash in September 1953. Investigators then put the cause of the crash was down to 'controlled flight into terrain'.

Vonn, a four-time overall World Cup champion, is out of contention for the overall title this season. Vonn blew out her right knee in a super-G at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria. She hurt her knee again in her comeback, keeping her out of last year's Sochi Olympics. She went nearly two years without a victory before winning a downhill in Lake Louise, Canada, in December. The following month, she overtook Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 World Cup victories. 'I'm incredibly thankful to be holding another downhill title,' Vonn said. 'It's been a long two years coming back from my injuries.' Vonn looks extremely focused as she speeds down the course during the alpine ski. Vonn will battle with Fenninger again on Thursday when the super-G title will be decided. Vonn is eight points ahead of Fenninger. 'Tomorrow is a chance for another globe. It's going to be tough because Anna's skiing really well, and it's going to be soft conditions like it was today,' Vonn said. 'But something about this track suits me.

Scroll down for video. The father of an 11-year-old girl who was allegedly the victim of online grooming filmed himself beating the man responsible before killing him in a gory video. But he had not realised he had actually been talking to the young girl's father. When he arrived for the supposed meeting, the man badly beat him and filmed it before killing him. A gory video of the attack has been posted online by the girl's father, as a 'warning that those who do wrong, have to pay for it', he said. In it the man can be seen bleeding heavily from a gaping wound around his mouth. In the video an angry exchange can be heard, with the alleged attacker swearing that he will never again try to contact the young girl. He can barely speak as he begs for mercy and appears to be being held up by the neck by the older man. Asked by the girl's father the man, with a swollen lip and face, pleads in Portuguese: 'Never again, never again, never again.' The father is said to reply: \u00a0'You will learn from this beating that you will now take you b*****d.' The camera is then taken off the alleged predator's face.

In a provocative intervention, Ben Wallace last night accused Scotland's First Minister of trying to break up Britain using the same tactics as the Russian president in the early days of the Ukraine crisis. Miss Sturgeon will use her keynote speech at the SNP's conference in Glasgow today to insist that she will 'demand an end to slash and burn austerity' in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street. A senior Tory  has said Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (right) is behaving like Russia's Vladimir Putin (left) by'stoking division in England' She will claim to be sending a'message of friendship and solidarity' to English voters who want an end to spending cuts that 'tear at the very fabric of society'. But Mr Wallace, a serving government whip who was once a Member of the Scottish Parliament, last night accused her of masterminding a plot designed to anger English voters and hasten the break-up of the UK. 'Nicola Sturgeon is intent on stoking division in England in the same way Putin used it to break apart Ukraine,' he said. 'I'm talking about the early days in the Ukraine crisis, before the tanks, when he spread division and fear in order for it to splinter apart. 'Separatists all over the world use division and nationalism to break up countries. Sturgeon may dress it up as friendliness, but that is what she wants \u2013 she wants England to tell the Scots to get lost. 'Labour could stop this if Miliband said he would not proceed with legislation... that could not get through without SNP votes. But if Labour's greed for power allows her to succeed, then God help the UK.' Miss Sturgeon has previously provoked anger by saying she would 'lock the Tories out' of Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament \u2013 even if they win the most seats. Miss Sturgeon has said she has no qualms about installing Mr Miliband (pictured) in No 10. She said she would have no qualms about installing Mr Miliband in No 10, despite believing that Scotland should not even be part of the UK. But she warned she would push for 'an end to austerity and the non-renewal of Trident' in return. Treasury figures show the SNP's plans would involve an extra \u00a3148billion of spending \u2013 leading to higher borrowing and taxes. However polls predict the party could win more than 50 of Scotland's 59 seats at the election \u2013 and could potentially prop up a minority Labour government. Miss Sturgeon will claim today that her party's Left-wing stance appeals to millions of voters in England. She will tell activists: 'To ordinary people across these islands who feel just as let down by the out of touch Westminster system as we do, I have a very clear message. 'It is a message of friendship and solidarity. As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, we will be your allies in seeking to reform that outdated system. 'So to people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I make this promise. The SNP stands ready to work with you. We will demand an alternative to slash and burn austerity.' Former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth accused Miss Sturgeon of 'arrogance' for boasting that she could hand power to Labour even if it loses the election. He said: 'We have had the Scottish referendum, which she lost, and now she wants to dictate policy to England \u2013 what arrogance. The SNP has demonstrated that it is deeply socialist \u2013 far worse even than Labour.' He said it would be 'catastrophic' for the UK if the SNP held the balance of power, as it would lead to'more spending and borrowing, higher taxes and weaker defences'.

A man from Seattle has captured a thief on surveillance camera easily breaking into his car using a mysterious electronic device (thief pictured above) The thief in the video is shown attempting to open the locked door, but is unable to so he takes off his backpack and holds it up to the window of the vehicle, and seconds later unlocks the car. Tom Dahl (above), 85, from West Seattle has shared the frightening video taken from his driveway to warn neighbors of the new ways criminals are hacking into cars. The incident, which occurred last month, involved an unidentified 'key fob' to unlock the vehicle, Detective Patrick Michaud from the Seattle Police Department told Daily Mail Online. Detective Michaud said police received reports of the break in on February 14 at 3am, and that the man seen in the video has not been arrested. The man reportedly searched the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment and took a club that was on his steering wheel, as well as a few store rewards cards that were left in the car, Daily Mail Online was told. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car, according to\u00a0Fox 13. 'You used to have a wire that you slid down the window, when it was mechanical. But now it's electronic,' said Mr Dahl. The man approaches Mr Dahl's car and pulls the handles realizing the door is locked. He then removes his backpack and flashes a light into the car. The man holds the backpack up the door and within seconds it is unlocked. He gets into the vehicle and searches through the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment taking a club on the steering wheel as well as store rewards cards. Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson, said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car, according to an earlier report. Mr Carlson had his car broken into two times before he installed a surveillance camera at his home. 'It's running through codes automatically or it's a button they're pushing or something is happening, but whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys,' Mr Carlson said at the time of the incident. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car (above Mr Dahl's Honda Ridgeline pictured in his driveway) Captain Eric Sano from the police department said that it is apparent as technology adapts, criminals are adapting, so it is important for authorities to be ahead of criminals. Scott Wagner, a special agent from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, said in January that he had knowledge of a special system being used. He said: 'It\u2019s a little black box. They can carry it in a backpack, when you hit your fob to unlock your car they can actually steal the codes to your keypad and then unlock your car later.' Detective Michaud said there has not been a lot of similarly reported cases in the area over the years and that he is unsure of what kind of device is being used in the break ins. Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson (above), said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car. Mr Carlson said: 'Whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys' (above a thief breaking into his car earlier this year) 'I've seen it both ways - a device in their hand as well as a device as big as an iron carried in a backpack,' he said. 'As technology moves on, the device gets smaller.' As for how to stay protected as a driver as this mystery device looms, Detective Michaud warns drivers to keep valuables out of the car. He said: 'We ask that people to not keep anything of value in the car. If you are going to leave your registration in the vehicle cross off identifying information, and let the officer know you crossed it off for security concerns.'

But the first arrivals were not the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the Lindo Wing were Michael and Carole Middleton - better known to George as 'Grandpa Michael' and 'Granny Carole'. Almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away, the Middletons have become a fixture in little George's life - with Prince Charles left to complain that they 'never let me see my grandson'. Scroll down for video. March of the Middletons: Prince Charles is reportedly upset by what he calls 'the March of the Middletons' In this case, the heir to the throne may well have a point. Visits to Highgrove, Charles' Gloucestershire home, have been few and far between. By contrast, William and Kate regularly take their son to the Berkshire village of Bucklebury where the Middletons live in a \u00a34.5m Georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside. Indeed, it was to Bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the Lindo Wing, with Prince George's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather Michael. The intimate photos, which show George cradled in the arms of his smiling mother, were, with hindsight, a sign of things to come. Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, was always determined to be a hands-on grandmother - and so it has proved. First visitors: Carole and Michael Middleton were the first people to meet the newborn Prince George. Sign of things to come: His first official photo was taken on the lawn of the Middletons' Bucklebury home. But the Middleton matriarch's determination to be involved in her grandson's life hasn't always gone down well with the rest of the family. 'Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats,' confided a source to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare. 'All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.' So how much involvement does Carole have in George's life? The answer is plenty. From cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child, there are few areas of George's life in which the Middletons aren't involved. Just a few weeks ago, Carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in Mustique, where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday. Although nanny Maria Theresa Borallo was there to deal with most of the childcare, Carole, who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson, was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand-in-hand with a toddling George. Holiday: George and his parents often holiday with the Middletons, seen here en route to Mustique. 'Queen Carole': Sources say Carole is taking an increasing amount of control over Prince George's life. Involved: Carole, seen here with the Duchess of Cornwall, is said to be a hands-on grandmother to George. And that is far from the only occasion that Carole has enjoyed one-on-one time with George. Just before the trip to Mustique, the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer's market with the third-in-line, who was, say witnesses, 'trying all the food'. Speaking to People Magazine, another onlooker told of Carole's obvious pride in her grandson's progress. 'It was just really, really sweet. He was just being like a normal toddler is, running around and exploring \u2013 he is such a sweetie. He's lovely. A real bundle of fun. 'She [Carole] just keeps telling people \"He's gorgeous, isn't he?\" like any other grandmother would say about their little one.' The Middletons also joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their infant son at Anmer Hall on Christmas Day where, according to sources, Kate made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get-togethers. Carole's influence could also be seen in the plans for George's first birthday celebrations which, in a break with royal tradition, included a Peter Rabbit themed party. Not amused: Charles is said to dislike what he sees as his 'peripheral' role in Prince George's life. Loving: This framed photograph of Charles and George has pride of place at Clarence House. Contrast that with Prince William's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny Barbara Barnes because his parents were on tour in Canada.

His team is using the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to simulate the waves and compare them to real seismograms. The resulting map could reveal the locations of tectonic plates and magma, which can cause earthquakes and volcanic activity.", "article": "Scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble-like simulations of Earth's interior. By recording seismic tremors, researchers are able to build a 3D picture of Earth's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core. They do this by analysing the speed of the tremors, which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma. Computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures. In this view of the mantle below the Pacific Ocean, slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue. The Princeton team fed data from seismograms into a computer model, which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter. The resulting \"synthetic seismograms\" were compared to real seismograms, and the differences fed back into the model to improve it. The researchers do this repeatedly, comparing data with simulations and extracting differences. With each pass, they improve their model. In these images, slower waves are in red and orange, while faster vibrations are in green and blue. The 3D models were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km) - by the end of the year. His team have been using the number-crunching capabilities of the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second. Professor Tromp has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater, which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide. These stations make recordings, or seismograms, that detail the movement produced by seismic waves, which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes. 'We are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes,' said Professor Tromp, 'but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features.' The resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates, which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other. The images were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a 3D map of the entire mantle, down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km), by the end of the year. A three-dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average. The maps could also reveal the locations of magma that, if it comes to the surface, causes volcanic activity, the researchers said. Previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves: primary or compressional waves, secondary or shear waves, and surface waves. Professor Tromp technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake \u2013 described as adjoint waves. The Titan computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter, and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms. The differences are then used by Titan to improve its model. Professor Tromp said: 'You don't know what it is you are looking for\u2026that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover.' This map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles (389 km). Blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds, and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds. The two panels on the right show a 746 miles (1,200 km) deep slice of the Earth taken from points B to b in Europe as shown in the left panel.

When Stuart Lancaster\u2019s side failed their biggest test of this competition, slumping to a shattering 19-9 loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium a fortnight ago, many observers said the rest of the Six Nations was redundant for them.

Ben Youngs hands off a tackle as England recovered from a half-time deficit to win at Twickenham. VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review. They said that the match against Ireland was the only game that could tell us whether England were making significant progress in the build-up to the World Cup and nothing that happened in their last two games against France or Scotland mattered. They were damned for the manner of their defeat, of course. Unflattering comparisons were drawn with where this side stands six months before the World Cup to the level Clive Woodward\u2019s side had reached at the same stage prior to the 2003 tournament. \u2018Based on their performances in the Six Nations, England are running the risk of being labelled the most foolish team in the competition,\u2019 England World Cup winner Will Greenwood wrote. \u2018England need to play with tempo, yes, but they need to do it with their rugby brains fully engaged and that is not what they have been doing at key moments.\u2019 England won the game but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations. Mike Brown was one of the better performers but England spurned too many opportunities at Twickenham. Despite the predictions, though, Saturday's battle for the Calcutta Cup told us plenty about England\u2019s prospects in the autumn. It wasn\u2019t all good by any means. In fact, the evidence of an exhilarating first half suggested again that England are still short of the standard they have to achieve to be realistic contenders for the World Cup. It felt like a wasted opportunity. Despite concerns that the match had not sold out, the atmosphere at Twickenham had been bolstered by the scenes playing on the screens inside and outside the stadium from Cardiff where Wales\u2019 victory over Ireland put England back in with a chance of winning the Six Nations. When England tore Scotland apart in the opening minutes, it felt as if this could yet be the game that ignited their confidence and laid the foundation for future success. That feeling did not last for long. George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half but the first half will have worried them. The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup. Defeating Scotland however will not lead the top nations to fear England, and time is running out. England were not ruthless enough in attack. They squandered chance after chance to convert breakaways, eschewing easy passes, making the wrong decisions. They should have scored four tries before half-time but they were limited to Jonathan Joseph\u2019s score after a neat sidestep five minutes into the game. It seemed then as if England were about to embark on the points rampage that would put them in prime position ahead of the final fixtures of the competition next weekend. That rampage did not materialise. Instead, Scotland came back into the game and more doubts began to surface about England. This time, it was their defence which suffered in comparison to the heroic efforts of the Welsh earlier in the day. Mark Bennett bulldozed his way over for a score with Scotland\u2019s first chance of the game midway through the half. Twickenham may still be a formidable place to get a result, but England are not unbeatable there. Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway as Lancaster's side returned to the Six Nations summit. England allowed Scotland back into the game too easily, and they lack momentum heading to the World Cup. Scotland actually led 13-10 at the interval. Their supporters began to dream of a first victory at Twickenham for 32 years. It was hardly the response to the defeat in Dublin that Lancaster was looking for. \u2018England need to be careful out there or they could end up with real egg on their face,\u2019 Woodward said at half-time. England banished that idea when George Ford burst over for a try three minutes into the second half but, even though Scotland never threatened again, England remained unconvincing.

This incident follows several other cases of passengers opening plane doors before take-off or after landing in China.", "article": "Air China flight attendants have been accused of being \u2018sloppy and careless\u2019 after a plane was photographed in flight with its door not properly locked. The photo of the Boeing 737-800 was snapped this month at Beijing Capital International Airport and went viral after it was uploaded onto Chinese social media networks. It showed the door\u2019s lock out of position while the plane was in the air at China\u2019s busiest airport, drawing criticism from air safety experts. This photo showing a plane door's lock out of position went viral on Chinese social media networks. Air safety expert Guang Yu told local media: \u2018It is probably not dangerous because there are various safety measures in place but it shows an extremely sloppy and careless attitude on behalf of the cabin crew.\u2019 Chinese state media agency Xinhua quoted an Air China spokesman as saying that the airline conducted a thorough investigation, including interviews with the plane\u2019s crew and other staff, after the photo surfaced online. It said the investigation found that the lock was in the \u2018normal\u2019 position when the flight took off. A Boeing specialist quoted by Chinese state media said that human error or a mechanical problem with the lock could result in an external lock being out of position. Air China said an investigation found that the lock was in the proper position when the flight departed. The expert added that a mechanical problem would not affect flight safety because of another locking system operated from within the cabin. The report also said that it appeared to be a case of mechanical failure. The photo sparked debate on Chinese social media website Weibo, and was shared after several incidents involving Chinese passengers opening plane doors before take-off or after landing. Last week a 42-year-old Chinese man was detained for 10 days after he opened an emergency exit shortly before a Urumqi Airlines plane was due to take off. The man told authorities that he thought the door handle was a handrail that he could grab onto for support, \u2018like the handrail on a bus\u2019. A Urumqi Airlines flight was delayed last week after a passenger opened the emergency exit. He was removed by police and detained for causing a disruption for others on board the plane, which was travelling from Urumqi to Zhengzhou. That incident was at least the fifth time since December a passenger has opened an emergency exit on a plane in China. Last month, an unidentified man was detained for 10 days after opening a plane emergency exit as passengers were boarding at Nanjing airport, the South China Morning Post reported. He told airline staff \u2018The door is not important\u2019 when they asked him why he opened the door, the newspaper reported. In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors on a China Eastern flight in Chengdu. In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors in protest of a weather-related delay as their China Eastern flight taxied to a runway in Chengdu. It led to a longer delay for everyone on board. A month earlier, a man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit \u2018to get off quicker\u2019 after a China Eastern flight landed in Hainan. By unlocking an opening the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide.

Ed Miliband today sought to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras. The Labour leader, who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities,was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife Justine in a modest kitchen at his \u00a32million North London home. Now it has emerged that the image of the Labour leader as a man of the people with a run-of-the-mill home was not all it appeared. For Mr Miliband actually lives in a house with two kitchens. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children tonight revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' The poky room the couple were pictured in, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed last night by a family friend to be a 'functional kitchenette' for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Today Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail. 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in yesterday's paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen. Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day. Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion.

The FBI said Friday it believes AWOL policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from Southern California to El Paso with his father in a pickup a week ago. The FBI is offering $25,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of Solis in connection with the death of Salome Rodriguez, 23, who died after a fight between the men in a downtown Pomona, California, bar. \"The pattern suggests he crossed into Mexico, but he has family and friends living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez,\" said Scott Garriola, special FBI agent who runs the fugitive task force from the Los Angeles Bureau. \"So he could be on either side of the border.\" \"It's a quick bus ride from the interior of Mexico to other parts of the country and Central America.\" The FBI, Pomona Police and Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to comment on whether Victor Solis might face charges for allegedly helping his son flee to El Paso. Garriola said Solis is a veteran of the Marines and \"he has extensive training and weapons\" understanding. Authorities posted three photos of Solis, with and without facial hair, and said he may now have a full beard. Police said after the early morning bar fight Solis pursued his victim on foot in the nightclub district and shot him multiple times. Garriola said Solis then reportedly called his father in Lancaster, California, and later that morning they began the trek to El Paso. Victor Solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in El Paso and his son made some incriminating statements \"not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again,\" Garriola said. Henry Solis worked in the Devonshire Division of the San Fernando Valley, where he rode with a training officer. Earlier this week, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck fired Solis and appealed for him to give up. \"You have dishonored this police department, your country and your service to your country,\" Beck said. Marine Corps records say Solis served in Iraq from April to November 2007, earning several medals, including for the Iraq campaign, global war on terrorism service and Marine Corps good conduct. The personnel file also shows Solis was an aircraft maintenance technician and a security guard.

Thomas Lavery and\u00a0Krystine Hall, who are both believed to work at Apple, were walking through New Haven on Sunday when they spotted firefighters tackling a raging fire outside a restaurant. But instead of standing back to allow the crew to deal with the blaze - which had started in a dumpster outside the pizza joint - they decided to capture themselves on video in front of it. Not a good idea: This is the moment Thomas Lavery and Krystine Hall posed for a video selfie in front of a dumpster blaze in Connecticut - only to be struck in the head by a stream of water from a firefighter's hose.

Mr Lavery tells the camera, 'it's a fire', as his friend pulls a series of faces. Mr Lavery and Ms Hall then burst into fits of laughter after the latter realizes her colleague is taking a video, not a photo. Mr Lavery then tells her: 'I just wanted to see them [the firefighters] get it out.' He goes on to say, 'here we go', as a firefighter picks up a water hose and aims it at the blaze.\u00a0But seconds later, his words are drowned out as the stream of water strikes the pair on the head.

Human rights campaigners have accused the police and judiciary of misusing anti-terrorism legislation in cases not related to militancy. In April last year, police in the eastern city of Lahore booked a nine-month-old boy on an attempted murder charge.", "article": "Two newly-wed brothers in Pakistan are spending their first weeks of married life behind bars after police arrested them on terrorism charges for letting off firecrackers during their joint wedding ceremony. Officers in Karachi said the grooms went 'too far' during the celebrations, and have charged the brothers and three other people under the explosive provisions of anti-terrorism legislation. If found guilty they could face long prison sentences, or even the death penalty. The brothers set off firecrackers, like the ones pictured, during their wedding ceremony in Karachi, Pakistan, but now face spending their married life behind bars after being charged with terrorism offences. Setting off fireworks and firing weapons into the air is a longstanding custom at Pakistani weddings, but police officer Abbas Golarchi said the wedding party's celebrations scared the community living nearby. He told agency AFP: 'Very powerful crackers were being used during the marriage ceremony creating fear among the neighbourhood, a densely populated area of the city.' The five arrested are in police custody awaiting a remand hearing which is due to take place on Wednesday. A sentence of the death penalty is unlikely, it is thought, before no-one was harmed during the joint wedding celebration. It is customary at Pakistani weddings to set off firecrackers and fireworks, and human rights campaigners have accused the police and judiciary of using anti-terrorism legislation in cases not related to militancy. Human rights campaigners say Pakistan's anti-terrorism legislation and anti-terrorism courts are frequently misused to prosecute cases that have nothing to do with militancy. In their World Report 2015, Human Rights Watch criticised the passing of the Protection of Pakistan Act by the country's government, denouncing it as 'overly broad' counter-terrorism legislation that violates international human rights standards and allows security forces to act without accountability. More generally, Pakistani police are often criticised for their heavy-handed approach. In April last year, police in the eastern city of Lahore booked a nine-month-old boy on an attempted murder charge after his family members allegedly threw bricks at officers trying to collect an unpaid bill. At least 40 people were killed in 2005 after firecrackers exploded on a bus carrying wedding guests back from a ceremony in Lahore, eastern Pakistan, according to a BBC report.", "candidates": [["Two newly-wed brothers in Pakistan were arrested on terrorism charges for letting off firecrackers during their wedding ceremony.

The Reds head into the weekend as favourites for the competition after fellow big guns Manchester United and Arsenal were drawn together in the last eight. Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn visit Anfield on Sunday and while Rovers are 25 places below their hosts Rodgers insists they will be treated the same as Manchester City - second in the Premier League - were last weekend. Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool will give Blackburn Rovers the respect they deserve in the FA Cup. Sky Bet Championship side Rovers managed to knock out the Premier League's Stoke City in the last round. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (right) loses his marker to score a goal against Burnley on March 4. Winger Raheem Sterling drills in a low cross against Burnley players during Liverpool's 2-0 win at Anfield. 'They got their first league win away from home in four months in the week (at Sheffield Wednesday) but we will give them the same respect we would give Manchester City or any other team,' said the Liverpool boss. 'It is a big game. We made it clear our intent in this competition was to get to the final and win it and to do that you have to beat different types of teams and Blackburn will come and look to make it difficult for us. 'I think (Rovers manager) Gary Bowyer has done an outstanding job since he has gone in there. 'He's had a similar pathway to myself in terms of working in youth development so he understands football clubs from the top to the bottom. 'He has gone in there in very difficult circumstances and stabilised the club and got everyone on the same path and has done an outstanding job.' While securing Champions League football for next season remains the priority Rodgers would dearly love to win some silverware in his third year in charge. Having reached the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup he hopes to go at least one better in this competition, although he admits he is only interested in a final at Wembley. 'People say getting to Wembley for the semi-final is a big thing but not really. Winning and getting to the final is the big priority,' he said. 'In many ways I wish the semi-final wasn't at Wembley because I think it takes a little bit away from it. For me Wembley should be the ultimate game. 'But of course it is a great opportunity if we do go through to play a game at Wembley, which we certainly wouldn't turn down. 'In domestic cup competitions we were unfortunate not to make the final and in the FA Cup we are giving everything we can to win a trophy while trying to fight to get into the top four. 'We want to get as high as we can - not just fourth - and win a trophy and if we can do that it will be a success.'

Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho (right) tussles with Burnley striker George Boyd (left) at Anfield. Liverpool are the team of the moment with their Premier League form second-to-none and, although their attacking style is again winning plaudits, what is probably more significant is their new-found defensive resilience. They have conceded just six goals in nine league matches since the turn of the year, during which time they are unbeaten. Despite enforced changes to his backline everyone now appears to know what job they are supposed to be doing - unlike earlier in the campaign when no matter who he brought in there was always an air of vulnerability. 'What is pleasing are the poor goals we have stopped conceding,' he said. 'Our method of play is based on aggressive pressure and with that you limit teams to not many opportunities. 'When that doesn't function well you concede poor goals. That was the key, we made too many mistakes.

He was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis at age 14, which left him paralyzed from the waist down, but he was inspired by a visit from Reggie Miller to never give up on his dreams. After years of applying for coaching positions, he was finally hired as head coach in 2014 and strives to be a messenger of hope for his students.", "article": "(CNN)On the basketball court, Karl Turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane. He'll get so caught up in the moment that he'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying. He's in the zone. Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players. \"Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams,\" says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers. All that changed on January 21, 1994. That night, the 14-year-old watched the Chicago Bulls beat his Pacers in an intense game. He walked to bed. He woke up paralyzed. He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again. \"Most patients do not recover well,\" said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital. A turning point came when Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' all-star player and Turk's favorite basketballer, heard about what Turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital. Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories. The basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces, similar to the ones Turk was wearing at the time. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out. \"Reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who I was,\" Turk said. \"For that moment, I felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness.\" It's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams. There was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance. Turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane, which he continues to walk with today. \"I keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where I have come from,\" said Turk. Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations. \"When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can,\" Arrow, now retired, told CNN. \"But he gets the job done no matter what.\" All Turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team. But it wasn't so easy. From 2009 to 2010, he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions. He only received one interview. The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching. \"I knew my resume was competitive,\" he said. \"I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone.\" He began to wonder if \"having a cane and an unusual gait\" would prevent him from ever coaching. In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve. In 2010, he was hired as assistant coach at West Oso. And in 2014, almost 10 years after moving to Corpus Christi, he became the head coach. He has strived to embody the ideals that Reggie Miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital. \"I want my students to know that I care about them, that I work for and belong to them,\" said Turk. \"So often, it's the messenger more than the message, I want to be the messenger that my students embrace.\" In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games.

He also praised Louis van Gaal for bringing discipline to the team and encouraged his Belgian teammate Adnan Januzaj to work harder to get back into the national team. Finally, Fellaini believes that he has been able to prove himself this season and is now enjoying his football.", "article": "Marouane Fellaini says it is 'nonsense' to suggest that Manchester United are turning into a route-one team by taking advantage of his height and power. Louis van Gaal has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in Belgium midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker, and it proved effective once again when United won 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a Champions League place. It has also led to criticism of United's tactics, with even West Ham boss Sam Allardyce labelling Van Gaal's team 'Long Ball United' after Fellaini's physical presence helped snatch a 1-1 draw at Upton Park last month. Marouane Fellaini (challenging Emre Can on Sunday) has slammed Manchester United's critics. Louis van Gaal's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut Premier League season. But Fellaini said: 'It is nonsense that our game system is based on me. Our system is based on many good players. 'We play a beautiful football. We play forward, scoring, putting on pressure. There are great players around.' Fellaini came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under David Moyes last season after following his old Everton boss to United in a \u00a327.5million deal, but can also play as a box-to-box midfielder. The 27-year-old admits it would be easier to pin down one position but is just grateful to be playing after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford. 'Fellaini is at his best when he plays,' he added. 'It does not matter where. This season we have played many different tactics: 3-5-2, 5-3-2, 4-2-2-2, 4-3-3. Of course, it would be easier to play in one position, but you have to always adjust to the coach. I play, that's the main thing. 'I can play in different positions. Number six, number eight or as a second striker. At eight, I can go back and forth and arrive in the box. Second striker I played at Everton. At United it's different because I play in a triangle in midfield. It's simple: I adjust myself to the system of the coach.' Fellaini admits that strict disciplinarian Van Gaal is exactly the kind of character United needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the Premier League under Moyes last season. Fellaini's performances are vastly improved under Van Gaal (pictured scoring against Tottenham this month) It looked as though Fellaini would be one of the first players out of the exit, but Van Gaal reassured him that he could still have a future at United when he arrived last summer. 'He told me \"prove yourself and we'll see\". Now they are counting on me. There were never any real doubts. I was injured at the beginning of the season and then returned. 'The coach gave me confidence and I proved myself in a few matches. After that, I was injured and I got sick again. For three weeks I was on antibiotics. It took a while, but now I can finally enjoy. 'The coach is very strict, but that's good. We needed such a coach. Last season we had a bad season. We even missed European qualification. We needed a coach who would put some players' feet back on the ground. Fellaini also backed Belgium team-mate Adnan Januzaj (far right) to make an impact at Old Trafford. 'If he says something, you should do it. Otherwise you'll fly out of it. If he has to take you off the pitch when the game hasn't been going on for more than 30 minutes he'll do it. Or during half-time. Fortunately, it hasn't happened to me yet.' Fellaini had some words of encouragement for his Belgian compatriot Adnan Januzaj who has struggled to make an impact under Van Gaal. The 20-year-old's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the Belgium squad for the forthcoming games against Cyprus and Israel. 'He has accepted his current situation,' said Fellaini. 'I try to help him. He knows he must play if he wants to come back for Belgium. It is part of growing up.

The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine. Areas in most demand include Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington.", "article": "Wealthy renters have paid \u00a3100 million up-front this year alone to cover their entire tenancy as competition for ideal homes intensifies, it was revealed today. With six or seven people chasing every top London property, bidders are desperate to beat their rivals to seal the deal on a home. As a result they are willing to pay a full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front - handing over \u00a3200,000 on average to the landlord. Areas in most demand: A map shows the top ten locations for up front rental payments in London. This is based on figures from Dataloft, which says the average prime London home costs \u00a33,500 per week to rent. In total, around \u00a3100 million has been paid up front in the first ten weeks of 2015, which is twice as much as the same period last year. The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine, according to letting agents E J Harris. Stamp Duty has also turned vendors into landlords and buyers into tenants as the central London \u00a32 million to \u00a320 million sales market has stalled. A number of these rich people are happy to pay their entire tenancy up front despite the properties costing them around \u00a310,000 per week. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, above, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. The top ten locations for up front rental payments are Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. Elizabeth Harris, managing director of E J Harris, said: 'The dramatic rise in up front tenancy payments is driven by several factors. 'Stamp Duty and mansion tax concerns has turned purchasers into tenants and so competition has risen for the best homes which has led to a rise in up front bids. A photo taken on Eaton Place in Belgravia - the area in London came second in the top ten list of up front rental payments. 'The London lettings market has become increasingly international with a new wave of wealthy tenants from Russia, Ukraine, Nigeria and China who are happy to pay their rents entirely up front. Estate agent\u00a0Tunstall Lettings had one case where a young woman in China paid \u00a34million up front for five years for a property in One Hyde Park. E J Harris had another case of a wealthy Nigerian paying more than \u00a31million up front to rent a property in Mayfair. 'Despite new lettings coming onto the market, the speed at which new lettings instructions are getting tenant offers has increased dramatically, so the number of available lettings properties is actually lower at the end of each week.' The mad market has been highlighted by a number of eye-opening deals. A one-bedroom Mayfair apartment was snapped up by a desperate tenant in a record-breaking 40 minutes. An a wealthy young man paid \u00a3400,000 up-front to rent a luxury flat only to love the place so much he bought it three days later - for more than \u00a310 million. Mark Tunstall, managing director of Tunstall Property, added: 'They have the financial wherewithal to sidestep the referencing requirements usually imposed by landlords by offering up-front lump-sum payments. 'Whilst global interest rates remain at historical lows it is of little consequence if those with substantial liquid cash reserves have to pay their rent in advance. 'And similarly, it doesn't confer the benefits on landlords that it used to do, when they would often accept a discount on the asking rent in return for the benefit of a slug of cash which they could then invest profitably elsewhere.' Knightsbridge came third on the list of top ten areas where money is paid up front for property rental.", "candidates": [["Wealthy renters have paid \u00a3100 million up-front this year alone to cover their entire tenancy as competition for ideal homes intensifies.

The preacher stood on a step ladder  in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall on Saturday afternoon ahead of the city's Mardi Gras parade before a group of buskers started to drown him out. 'Before I could look up, people were surrounding him and few of them were happy,' the musician told Daily Mail Australia. According to Mr Winter, the hateful messages quickly became aggressive and soon started to cause a lot of tension in the crowd. 'It was Mardi Gras - not only a day to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights, but also equality and unity towards all people,' he said.

The Baggies defender was dismissed by Neil Swarbrick instead of teammate Michael Dawson who sent Wilfried Bony crashing to the floor when he was clean through. After the match an incredulous Pulis said: 'I can't believe he's picked the wrong player - it's beyond me.' Tony Pulis has called for the introduction of video technology to help referees after Neil Swarbrick's error. Swarbrick showed a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute after a foul on Wilfried Bony. West Brom defender Craig Dawson (right) makes the original challenge on Bony just outside the penalty area. The Ivorian striker heads to the ground under Dawson's clumsy challenge but managed to continue. Bony continues but McAuley  comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area. Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player. He added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced. 'It is no good moaning about referees,' Pulis said. 'We have to find a way to help referees out I would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video. 'The clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards. It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world. The sooner that comes in the better.' BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him. A difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from Wilfried Bony, Fernando and David Silva wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are, for now, three points behind leaders Chelsea who have two games in hand. City manager Manuel Pellegrini reflected on a morale-boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at Burnley and then bow out of the Champions League at Barcelona. 'Of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game,' he said. 'We lost the last two games in different competitions, Wednesday in Champions League and the last game against Burnley in Premier League. It is important to return to victory.' Fernando (centre) scored City's second of the match after Bony's opener and before David Silva added a third. The Chilean added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on Jose Mourinho's leaders. 'We are not thinking about that,' he said. 'I spoke with the players, we play now eight games more. We can win the eight games and if Chelsea doesn't drop points, we cannot win the title.

{"abstract": "Wisconsin and Connecticut are the only two states with laws that require an investigation of officer-involved deaths to be conducted by an outside agency. This law is intended to ensure unbiased investigations and to address public suspicion of police corruption. However, there are political and financial obstacles to implementing such laws, and some worry that they could work against minorities.", "article": "(CNN)When an officer kills an unarmed suspect, the question arises time and again: Can a police department investigate a high-stakes case involving one of its own, without bias? For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. \"The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,\" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. \"I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,\" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. \"We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that.\" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires \"an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. \"Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,\" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. \"This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. \"Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,\" she said. \"There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed.\" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. \"Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,\" he said. \"And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.\"There are \"powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,\" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. \"For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,\" he said. \"If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system.\" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.

They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday. Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system. Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench. Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder \u2013 was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool\u2019s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea\u2019s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool\u2019s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville\u2019s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson\u2019s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection. But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea\u2019s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side\u2019s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does. VIDEO Monk rues missed chances. Mamadou Sahko (right) puts in a challenge on Jonjo Shelvey as he again impressed for Liverpool. Martin Skrtel (left) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved Liverpool defence. Yes, the defenders look more assured.

Scroll down for video. Replacement? Trevor Noah (left) joined The Daily Show as a correspondent three months ago. But now, he has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace the Comedy Central program's host Jon Stewart (right) 'Shortlisted': The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year. According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days. Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.' If Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - replaces Stewart on The Daily Show this year, he will be joining a primarily white, male and straight late night show landscape. At present, Comedy Central is the only network to have an African-American host: Larry Wilmore, A network spokesman declined to tell Variety whether Noah was being considered for Stewart's job. No stranger to controversy: During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, Noah (pictured during the broadcast) used his mixed-race heritage and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests in the US over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart that his arms were 'tired' from constantly 'holding them up' Thorny issues: 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart. Noah, who grew up in Gauteng, started his entertainment career at 18 on the\u00a0South African soap opera, Isidingo. He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station. Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out. In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show. The following year, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman. During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, the comedian, whose mother is a black South African and father is a white Swiss, discussed race and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests across the United States over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart his arms were 'tired' because he had been constantly 'holding them up' since he had arrived in America. Positive: Over the past 24 hours, people across the country have been taking to social media to express their views on Noah as the potential new host of The Daily Show, with many deeming it 'great' news (pictured) 'A great addition': Briton Tim Browning tweeted Noah, asking: 'Any truth to rumour about the daily show?' Hopeful: A Twitter user called Sarah said she hoped'so badly' the comedian would be named the new host. 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart. And he\u00a0challenged\u00a0the host to game of 'Spot The Africa', featuring snapshots of America and Africa.

Barbaric: Islamic State militants dealt yet another blow to Christian history in Iraq this week by using explosives to destroy the 4th Century Mar Benham monastery. Mar Benham monastery was captured by ISIS last July in a lightning advance that saw the militants seize control of vast swathes of northern Iraq - including the country's second largest city, Mosul. Resident monks who live in the building - which is also known as the Monastery of the Martyrs Saint Behnam and his Sister Sarah, and was once visited by thousands of Christians and Muslims every year - were subsequently forced to leave and flee to nearby Christian villages. The destruction of the religious building was subsequently confirmed by Barzan Sadiq, executive producer at Kurdish Rudaw media network, according to the International Business Times.

The statue is thought to have been one of only two genuine artifacts destroyed by ISIS in the video. The destruction of the\u00a0monastery emerged as the United Nations human rights office said that ISIS fighters may have committed genocide against the minority Yezidi community in Iraq as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians including children. In a report based on interviews with more than 100 alleged victims and witnesses, it urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court for prosecution of perpetrators. The report also said Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias'may have committed some war crimes' while battling the insurgency. The U.N. Human Rights Council launched its inquiry in September after the Islamist militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized large swathes of northern Iraq. The oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Mosul is a notorious stronghold for the Islamic State terrorist organisation. Stronghold: Last summer ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) made his first and so far only filmed public appearance when he delivered a firebrand sermon in Mosul's Great Mosque. The report said the Council had found 'information that points to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes', and that the Security Council should 'consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court'. There was a'manifest pattern of attacks' by Islamic State on Yezidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq. The U.N. investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September. Captured women and children were treated as'spoils of war', and often subjected to rape or sexual slavery, it said. The report said that ISIL's Islamic sharia courts in Mosul had also meted out cruel punishments including stoning and amputation.

Given that cities are lit up 24-hours-a-day in many developed countries, there are fears that such ecological impacts may be widespread. Researchers have shown that light pollution can impact the natural environment in complex ways that may be hard to predict. This image shows the\u00a0two different types of light treatment used -\u00a0\u2018white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating a type of sodium street lamp. Researchers from the University of Exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night. They exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a \u2018white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the UK and further afield. The experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid. The low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid-summer. The study showed that\u00a0low intensity amber light caused by street lighting in cities (a stock image of London at dusk is shown) prevented flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid summer. Bright lights in Europe\u2019s cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins. Animal biologists from Glasgow University and the Max Planck Institute for Orntihology in Seewiesen, near Munich, fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of Munich and in a nearby forest. The light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts. They found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average. The additional light had an effect on the city birds\u2019 photoperiod, which is the part of the day that organisms use to time their daily and seasonal biology. As a result, the birds in early March experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late March, according to the study published in journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. The city birds\u2019 perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds. Study leader Dr Davide Dominoni of the university, said: \u2018Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals. \u2018The global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species, but we\u2019re very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night.' They found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-August due to the limited amount of food available. Professor Kevin Gaston, Director of the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) said: \u2018These are the first findings from major long-term experiments \u2026 and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms.\u2019 Dr Jonathan Bennie added: \u2018Our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs. \u2018While we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night, we show that they may have more permanent, widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.\u2019 Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don\u2019t like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street-lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat. The findings have important implications for conservation, overturning the previous assumption that common bats benefited from street-lights because they could feed on the insects that congregated around them. The research, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that the activity of soprano pipistrelle, noctule and serotine bats was similar or lower in areas with street lighting compared with dark areas. An increase in the activity of the UK\u2019s most common bat, the common pipistrelle, was only seen in locations where there was also a high amount of shelter from trees or hedgerows.

{"abstract": "A new study has found that babies conceived through IVF may be twice as likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally.

A separate study published this month found that autism is mainly caused by a childbytes:\\xe2\\x80bytes:\\x99s genes, rather than lifestyle factors.", "article": "Babies conceived through IVF may be twice as likely to develop autism, according to new research. Children conceived using assisted reproductive technology were more likely to develop autism than babies conceived naturally. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes any type of fertility treatment where the egg and the sperm are handled outside of the body, including IVF, artificial insemination and surrogacy. During IVF - the most popular ART treatment - more than one egg is harvested and fertilised, which can lead to multiple births. Babies conceived through IVF (pictured) are more likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally, a study found. But this could be due to the complications of IVF, such as multiple births. Researchers explained they found an association between IVF and autism - but they did not prove that the treatment cause the disorder,\u00a0according to HealthDay news. The higher risk of the disorder could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with IVF, not the treatment itself, they said. After taking into account factors such as the mother's education and multiple births, researchers found the increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old. And they found there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child. This means IVF using a single-egg transfer rather than multiple eggs lowers the chance of a baby developing autism, experts said. The study involved nearly six million children born from 1997 to 2007. The team, led by Peter Bearman, a professor of social sciences at Columbia University in New York City, collected data on 5.9 million California births, including 48,865 infants conceived through assisted reproduction, and 32,922 children with autism. Autism is mainly caused by a child\u2019s genes, a major study of British twins has found. Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King\u2019s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. They compared the incidence of autism in births that involved advanced infertility treatment such as IVF and those that didn't. Professor Bearman said this was the largest study looking at this relationship that has ever been carried out. The results are not a condemnation of IVF technology, as the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link, he said. He added: 'There is an association between IVF and autism, but when we control for the characteristics of women who are more likely to use IVF, for example, age and social status, this association is lessened significantly,' The remaining increased risk is due to factors such as multiple births and complications of pregnancy and delivery associated with IVF, he said. He added that there was no significant increased risk of the disorder for children of women who gave birth to one child. He said: 'Knowing that one can largely reduce the risk of autism by restricting the procedure to single-egg transfer is important for women who can then make better informed decisions.' The research was published online in the American Journal of Public Health.

Characters Jude and Connor, both 13, locked lips after some awkward flirting and playful wrestling during Monday night's episode. 'Anyone else remember the exquisite torture of falling for someone and not knowing how they felt? My life in jr. high.,' tweeted the show's creator, Peter Paige, who previously starred in Queer as Folk. Jude and Connor's friendship has been building over the past two seasons and in a previous episode the boys had held hands at the movies and even kissed, although not on screen. The boy's big moment isn't the first same-sex kiss between teenagers on TV, but it is the youngest as shows including Glee and Teen Wolf featured older teens, reports The Daily Beast. The show, which premiered in 2013, is known for pushing the envelope and has been heavily criticized for it by right leaning organizations such as One Million Moms which had called for the show to be boycotted even before it aired. The group, which has routinely advocated against the depiction of same-sex couples in the media, stated: 'While foster care and adoption is a wonderful thing and the Bible does teach us to help orphans, this program is attempting to redefine marriage and family by having two moms raise these children together.

Tests have shown that the water meets federal safety guidelines, but residents are still concerned about health issues. Oakland County is watching the situation unfold, as they have explored building a separate water and sewer structure in the past.", "article": "Less than an hour's drive from one of Earth's great fresh water sources, some people in Flint are searching for a drop worth drinking. Since the financially struggling city broke away from the Detroit water system last year, residents have been unhappy with the smell, taste and appearance of water from the city's river as they await the completion of a pipe to Lake Huron. They also have raised health concerns, reporting rashes, hair loss and other problems. A General Motors plant stopped using the water, saying it was rusting its parts. Officials say recent state tests show the water meets federal safety guidelines, and the city will be better off free of the leviathan Detroit system once the pipeline is complete by 2016. And while many Detroit suburbs have long dreamed of breaking their dependence on the city's water, further-away Flint is the first to risk it \u2014 and test whether the potential savings are worth going it alone. Scroll down for video. Fresh and clean? In this January 21, 2015 image, LeeAnne Walters shows water samples from her Flint home that were collected that month. Giveway: In this Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015 photo, Genetha Campbell carries free water being distributed at the Lincoln Park United Methodist Church in Flint. 'Unfortunately, some of our problems aren't quickly or easily solved,' said Jerry Ambrose, Flint's state-appointed emergency manager, adding that the 'challenges' resulting from the temporary reliance on the river 'were greater than we expected.' 'The potential to leave (Detroit) was well-supported by a business case, and in the long-term will benefit this region as well as the city of Flint,' Ambrose said. While there won't be'magical reductions' in rates, he said, cost increases should be much less. Flint had long chafed at the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department's rising prices. Flint officials estimated the cost of buying water from Detroit this year at $16 million, and the overall annual cost of switching to the new Karegnondi Water Authority would be $12.5 million. Still, the long-discussed divorce has brought real and figurative headaches. Tests released last week show the water is safe, but complaints from residents persist. They say the water looks brown or rusty, and tastes and smells of chlorine. People have protested at council meetings, held community hearings, hosted water giveaways and marched through downtown. Facebook pages have been forums for complaints and concerns. Last month, the county started distributing bottled water to about 1,300 preschool students and a children's museum recently blocked access to water fountains, citing Safe Drinking Water Act violations because of high levels of a disinfectant byproduct. High bacteria levels forced boil-water advisories last year. Resident Tony Palladeno Jr., 53, said he gets bottled water from a grocery store or spring water from his cabin further north, but uses city water for showers. 'No matter what, if I go in, one time it's going to be my eyes, or I'll get headaches or my lungs,' he said, adding that he's lost hair and produces a bottle of it to illustrate. 'People say, \"Oh, it's paranoia.\" No.... I'm living this.' Community issue: Lemott Thomas carries free water being distributed at the Lincoln Park United Methodist Church in Flint, Michigan, on February 3. Residents have raised numerous health concerns over the city's water.

(February 3 file photo) Protest:  Flint resident Jessica Owens carries a sign in the shape of a wide-eyed skull on February 4 to signify Flint's water and its health issues during a protest of the city's water quality. Palladeno, who considers his city 'a guinea pig,' and others are angered by the decision to let the GM Engine Plant stop using Flint water and link with a township that gets water from Detroit. The move could cost the city about $400,000 per year in lost revenue. Rick Holtstander boiled his tap water at first, but says he rubbed his finger around the inside of the pan and picked up'something that looked just like cigarette ash.' 'I don't even let my dogs drink this water,' he said as he collected four gallons at a recent water giveaway. Activists have urged Flint to return to Detroit's system, which has offered to reconnect the city at last year's rates. Other Detroit water customers are watching how the situation unfolds.

Zelalem was born in Berlin and played for Germany at youth level and was also eligible to play for Ethiopia through his parents. However the player has expressed a desire to play for the United States and gained U.S. citizenship in December, opening the door to a potential switch pending permission from the world governing body. VIDEO Scroll down to see Zelalem score an amazing basket for Thierry Henry. Gedion Zelalem in action for Arsenal against Galatasaray in the Champions League in December 2014. 'He is a special case. I think he is already at a level that he can definitely play with the senior team,' Klinsmann told reporters. Although Zelalem has yet to feature in a Premier League game for Arsenal he is seen as one of the most exciting prospects in the club's youth ranks. He made his first-team debut in the FA Cup win over Coventry City in January last year and made another appearance from the bench in the Champions League game away to Galatasaray in December 2014. USA head coach Jurgen Klinsmann hopes that FIFA grants Zelalem permission to play for his side. Klinsmann did not rule out the midfielder being given a slot in one of the U.S. youth teams at some stage but said he wanted to see him with the first team initially. 'Definitely I would like to see him with me first. I want to see how he interacts with the whole group and what level he is in. For the next dates, I am totally open to have him in the Under-23s,' he said. Zelalem lived in the United States from 2006 until 2013 when he joined London club Arsenal. Zelalem, playing for the Gunners during his debut last year against Coventry, lived in the USA from 2006-13. FIFA rules, designed to stop players from being granted citizenship for entirely football reasons, require players to live in a country for five years after their 18th birthday before they are eligible.

Police chiefs today announced that they have arrested 56 people - all Brits, including the three alleged leaders - and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims. And they said they feared thousands more would now be identified following a series of Costa del Sol raids against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. Detectives detailed the lengths the fraudsters went to dupe victims into handing over cash at a press conference in Malaga this morning. The three-tier scam involved calls from fake lawyers and court officials who persuaded their victims to hand over up to \u00a335,000 after being conned into selling their timeshares. Scroll down for video. Hotspot: The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol (pictured) The chief alleged ringleader, a Brit living in the resort of Mijas, had three homes and a boat and drove two luxury cars he is thought to have bought with his ill-gotten gains. Nearly 80 bank accounts linked to the gang have been frozen and six vehicles seized along with the boat and properties valued at nearly \u00a3600,000. Lead investigator, Inspector Mercedes Perez Quesada, said: 'The fraud was three-fold. 'Telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of Spanish law once they'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees. 'Any excuse to get money out of them was valid. 'Once victims had been conned and knew they were never going to get their money back, a second group of people would call claiming to be lawyers saying they were going to launch a group action on behalf of victims and asking once again for money upfront. 'The third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements. 'The scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between \u00a335 and \u00a335,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between \u00a33.5 million and \u00a34.5 million a year. 'The telesales operators were at the bottom rung of the fraud but knew exactly what was going on. 'The next level up were front men paid to open bank accounts so it made it more difficult to find out where the money had gone. 'They would receive commissions on the transfers of up to \u00a3360...Money collectors working for the three alleged ringleaders would collect up to \u00a32,150 from each front man on a daily basis and pass it on to their paymasters. 'The leaders were the brains behind the operation and the final recipients of the money... They started the operation we have smashed in 2009. Concern:\u00a0Police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the Costa del Sol (pictured) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years.

Much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts. Two of the three alleged leaders were arrested along with 36 other suspects in raids in February during the first phase of the operation. The man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to Spain from the UK. A judge at a court in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola is now coordinating an ongoing criminal investigation. He is probing 11 companies believed to have been set up to facilitate the fraud. Two men including the alleged ringleader have been remanded in jail after a closed court hearing and the remainder released on bail. None of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under Spanish law, but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and membership of a criminal gang. Inspector Perez said: 'We know so far this organisation defrauded 500 British victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims.' Police also admitted the alleged ringleader had been arrested before for similar offences. They were not able to say whether he had been convicted in court. Malaga police chief Pedro Garijo Torres said: 'We don't want to comment on things that escape our control. 'The important thing for us was the police operation which is of huge significance in an area like Malaga whose economy relies so heavily on tourism and foreign visitors.' Government spokesman for the area Jorge Hernandez Mollar described the police operation, involving financial crime specialists from Madrid and Malaga, as 'brilliant.'", "candidates": [["Spanish police have arrested 56 people, including the three alleged leaders, in connection with a five-year criminal operation that duped thousands of British victims out of more than \u00a34 million a year.

{"abstract": "England captain Eoin Morgan has been criticized for the team's poor performance in the World Cup, and they face elimination if they lose to Bangladesh on Monday. England have been relying heavily on statistics, and have stuck with Gary Ballance at the expense of Alex Hales. Broad and Anderson have not been able to take early wickets, and England need all their players to perform if they are to have any chance of success in the tournament.", "article": "If Eoin Morgan wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all England\u2019s many under-achieving World Cups then he made a good job of it. The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. The subject of England\u2019s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation. Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval. England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday. England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh. \u2018Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.\u2019 Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains? Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance\u2019s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England\u2019s first World Cup game against Australia. England warm up during a nets session at the Adelaide Oval where they will meet Bangladesh. Chris Jordan (left) is held back at the Adelaide Oval as he and his team-mates get prepared. Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. \u2018The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018There wasn\u2019t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won\u2019t be taken lightly nor quickly.\u2019 No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England\u2019s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament. If England really are determined not to pick Hales \u2014 and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer \u2014 then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again. Ravi Bopara (right) and Eoin Morgan of England look on during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval. Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores. England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh. The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three. Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult one really,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven\u2019t been able to take early wickets.\u2019 England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh \u2014 who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off \u2014 at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering. However, upsets do happen and Bangladesh have the ammunition to cause one. The simple truth is, at the moment, England do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here.
