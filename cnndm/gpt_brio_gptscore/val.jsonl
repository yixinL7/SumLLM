The 33-year-old known anonymously as Juror 17 says she's received death threats and widespread ridicule ever since she remained unmoved by 'brutal' jury room debates and an attempt to have her booted from the jury. In a multi-part interview with KPNX in which 17 will no doubt explain her obstinance, the mother of three maintained she entered the trial simply to serve her civic duty and denied allegations she was some'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life. Speaking out: The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Jodi Arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule. Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement. 'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.' Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little. She will live: The latest Arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock. This one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty. 'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX.\u00a0'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.' When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would. However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose. Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail. Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection. 'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.' Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on.

Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago. Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing. Outrage: Social media critics have lashed out at Juror 17 with claims she was a'stealth juror' out to save Arias, that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family. Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial. 'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement.

{"abstract": "Doneil Henry joined Blackburn Rovers on loan from West Ham on Wednesday and made an immediate impact in their victory over Sheffield Wednesday. He is now set to start in the FA Cup quarter-finals against Liverpool at Anfield, a game he is looking forward to despite never having been there before. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer has faith in Henry and believes that if the team stays together, they have a chance of getting a result.", "article": "Playing Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals holds no fears for Doneil Henry - providing he does not have to take the train to Anfield. The Canadian's whirlwind beginning to life at Blackburn looks set to continue with a starting spot on Sunday. Injury problems in defence prompted Rovers boss Gary Bowyer to take Henry on a month's loan from West Ham on Wednesday, the same day they played Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. Three hours after meeting his team-mates for the first time, Henry walked out onto the pitch at Hillsborough and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps Blackburn's play-off hopes alive. Doneil Henry made a good start to his Blackburn career after joining on loan from West Ham. Henry said: 'I got a call from the manager in the morning and I was told I was going on loan and I was hopefully playing that night. 'I had to collect my stuff from Upton Park, sign some paperwork and then be on a train. I got on the wrong train, asked the ticket man if it was going to Sheffield to find out I had to get off and get on another train. 'After that finally I recognised some people in Blackburn kit at the train station and from there I was in safe hands. I met the team, did pre-game stuff and then just played. 'I was just really happy to play. It's been a while. I knew me thinking too much wouldn't be good, I just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team.' Henry began his career at home-town club Toronto and joined West Ham in January after being recommended to Hammers boss Sam Allardyce by former Toronto manager Ryan Nelsen. Nelsen played for Allardyce at Blackburn, where he was captain and a hugely popular figure. Canadian international Henry joined West Ham in January from MLS side Toronto. 'It was funny coming to Blackburn and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards,' said Henry. 'Ryan has been a mentor since he came to Toronto. He really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey. I knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went. 'Junior Hoilett also played here, who's a close friend of mine, so I knew it would be a good move for me.' The 21-year-old has never been to Anfield before but did face Liverpool on their pre-season tour to North America in 2012. He knows securing the win needed to get to Wembley will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad. Henry played against Liverpool in America in a pre-season game - but has never been to Anfield. Henry said: 'I'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and I just thought they believed in me from the get-go. 'When we get the test on Sunday, I think we'll definitely be ready. There's a lot of quality players in here so I think if we can go there and do our job, as long as we stay together as a team, it's definitely possible to get a result. 'I'm not going to shy away from the opportunity. These are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level.' Bowyer is definitely without three defenders in injured trio Jason Lowe, Shane Duffy and Alex Baptiste, while Grant Hanley is a major doubt. But the Rovers boss has total faith in his new man, saying: 'Full credit to him and his character. 'He's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank West Ham for allowing him to come to us. Everybody at West Ham spoke very highly of him and his performance on Wednesday backed that up.

He argued that it would counteract money more than anything and completely change the political map in the country. Conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration due to concerns about voter fraud and cost.", "article": "President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' Attorney General Eric Holder has openly endorsed automatic voter registration, adopted two days ago by Oregon, the first American state to officially embrace the measure, but Obama had not made his support for either that or compulsory voting clearly known until today. President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. The president said the people in America who 'tend not to vote' are usually younger, of lower income and skew toward 'immigrant groups' and minority groups. 'And they're often the folks who are scratchin' and climbin' to get into the middle class,' he said, 'and they're working hard.' 'There's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls,' he said. 'We should wanna get them into the polls.' The remark as a subtle reference to Republican efforts at the state level to pass legislation that would require registered voters to prove that they are who they say that they are at the polls with a government-issued photo identification card. Republicans say that such measures prevent voter fraud. Democrats claim that they stop legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the electoral process. Many Democrats believe that's the point of the laws - to keep groups that traditionally vote Democrat, especially minorities, from casting a ballot - and have characterized voter ID laws as racist for that reason. Requiring the elderly, who sometimes don't drive, and minorities, who when they live in major cities often take public transportation, as well as the low-income sector of society, which can't afford always afford government identification cards, is a modern day poll tax, Democrats have argued. Supporters of the photo ID laws have tried to assuage their concerns by setting aside funds for government-funded ids and offering free rides to the DMV in certain states. Obama's Department of Justice has taken many of the states that have passed such laws to court, with the notable exception of Virginia, which put in place processes to counteract the hardship that the new requirement places on certain individuals. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' The president is seen here mingling with guests of the event at The City Club of Cleveland. Conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration for many of the same reasons they believe states should adopt stricter regulations at the polls. In Oregon, also the first state in the U.S.to conduct its elections entirely by mail-in ballot, Republicans worry that the mass distribution of millions of ballots by mail, which can easily be tampered with in residential areas, creates an opening for new instances of voter fraud. Millions of ballots will be sent out and the state has little control over where they end up. The cost of implementing the law is also of concern, as the system will ensure that every Oregon resident receives a ballot unless they opt-out. There's also the question of where the DMV can ensure that the personal information it will use to pre-register voters and contact them will remain private. Automatic registration is popular in foreign countries, including Sweden, Argentina and Canada, where it has helped bring the voter participation rate up above 90 percent but remains controversial domestically. Comparatively, just over half the U.S. population regularly votes. Roughly 56 percent of eligible Americans cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. Australia, which enforces mandatory voting, has a 100 percent rate of participation. President Barack Obama tours Magnet at Cleveland State University before his speech on Wednesday afternoon. Obama brought up the topic of compulsory voting while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics. Speaking at the The City Club of Cleveland today, Obama brought the subject up on his own while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics. 'I don't think I've ever said this publicly, but I'm going to say it now,' Obama said, before bringing up compulsory voting.

{"abstract": "The digital economy is erasing jobs and replacing them with low-paying, unstable freelance gigs, leaving millennials financially stranded. This \"winner-take-all\" economy is not sustainable and is leading to a dystopian future with no meaningful occupation for many people. To fight this slide back toward the Middle Ages, we can stop glorifying tech titans, increase worker protections, and invest in education and training.", "article": "(CNN)We have no problem taking Wall Street executives to task for decisions that leave American families financially devastated, yet we give Silicon Valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing. America needs to realize that instead of creating jobs, Silicon Valley is erasing them, leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground. Silicon Valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday's laptop. The commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education, a young person in America can get a good job. But despite falling unemployment, college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low-paying jobs that don't even require a college degree. The percentage of young people languishing in low-skill, low-paying jobs is 44%, a 20-year high. Only 36% of college grads have jobs that pay at least $45,000, a sharp decline from the 1990s, after adjusting for inflation. Perhaps most depressingly, the percentage of young people making below $25,000 has topped 20%, worse than in 1990. In other words, those with a bachelor's diploma were better off before the digital revolution. If this comes as a surprise, that's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude. In our collective imagination, millennials are saying, \"No jobs? That's OK \u2014 I'll create my own!\" And then they solve their own problems by heading to Silicon Valley with little more than an iPhone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires. A fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be Mike Bean, founder of Internet behemoth Gryzzl on the show \"Parks and Recreation.\" Played by Blake Anderson, Bean might best be described as \"barefoot and pregnant with ideas.\" The bumbling entrepreneur conquers the world practically by accident, armed only with his digital savvy, a can-do spirit, and a penchant for invading users' privacy. You get the idea that his success came easily. Privacy concerns aside, the Mike Beans of America are just about as rare as the Mark Zuckerbergs. In fact, the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24-year low. Garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups. But wait \u2014 won't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs? After a period of adjustment, won't things get better? Unfortunately that's not the path we're on. One of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology, there's a new, equally good (or better) job created by Silicon Valley. But exactly the opposite is happening. The digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs: minimum wage jobs (think Amazon warehouse employees) and so-called \"sharing-economy jobs\" (think Uber drivers). The sharing-economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers. Sharing economy jobs aren't really jobs at all; they're freelance gigs. Sure, Silicon Valley doesn't owe America jobs. But something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages, decreased worker protection and zero job security. This \"winner-take-all\" digital economy is not sustainable. People on both sides of the political spectrum are worried. Liberal luminary Robert Reich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and former secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, calls the sharing economy the \"share-the-scraps\" economy. Speaking of tech companies that utilize on-demand labor, such as Uber, Instacart and Taskrabbit, he says, \"The big money goes to the corporations that own the software. The scraps go to the on-demand workers.\" Meanwhile, conservative columnist Ross Douthat fears a dystopian future in which \"a rich, technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents.\" Put simply, Silicon Valley's utopia is the rest of America's dystopia. And those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates, whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback. And if you think your own job is safe, think again. New research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades. This is a giant leap backward, but it's deceptively described as technological \"progress.\" As anyone who's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest, \"automated\" usually means \"worse.\" What can be done? How can we fight this slide back toward the Middle Ages? If we take no action, we're headed toward a kind of digital world feudalism where there are a handful of kings, a lot of peasants and no middle class. There's no easy fix, but we can do three things immediately.

The west side of Lewis is the best place in the country to view the event, and Stornoway Astronomical Society has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across Britain and Europe wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse. Eclipse viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and B&Bs are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand. Scroll down for video. Visitors to the Isle of Lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse. Friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years and the best place to witness it is set to be in the Isle of Lewis. The tiny and remote hamlet of Aird Uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place in the UK to experience the deepest part of the solar eclipse - and shadow fever is starting to grip the area. Seacroft is Aird Uig's only B&B. Proprietor Sarah Taylor-Gerloch had sold both her spare rooms - but one, costing \u00a375-a-night, was to a couple of Dutch eclipse chasers. 'They have had to unfortunately cancel. He wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises. So the room is free,' said Mrs Taylor-Gerloch. Aird Uig is set to be the best place for viewing Friday's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent. The village of Aird Uig has only one B&B, and one couple's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse. The Isle of Lewis is als famous for the Callanish prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old. 'Ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until I told them. They were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them. 'We have a glorious view all the way to the Butt of Lewis but the eclipse has helped put Aird Uig on the map. It will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists. But it is a long way to come on the off chance. Aird Uig is a village on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Aird Uig is within the parish of Uig. Known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape. Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying \u00a3135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.'

A convicted rapist sentenced to 14 years  has been granted a marriage licence to wed his long-term girlfriend so he can receive conjugal visits while in prison. Kevin Mitchell violently attacked the 30-year-old woman inside her own apartment in New York in the early hours of the morning, threatening her that he had a gun and would slit her throat. Mitchell, 34, pleaded guilty to one count of Rape in the First Degree at Manhattan Supreme Court on February 11, 2015. However, instead of being sent straight to a state penitentiary in upper New York State immediately, Mitchell was granted a one-month stay in Rikers Island so he could get married to Tyneka Hudson. Ms Hudson told the New York Daily News following her would-be husband's sentence: 'I'm going to stay by his side. He's a good man.' Prosecutors claim that Mitchell followed his victim into her apartment at 5.30am on the day of the attack. However, Ms Hudson questions the verdict. She said: 'No one knows the real story. Only she and him know. I can\u2019t say he did it. I can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t do it. He told me he didn\u2019t rape the lady. He said they were drinking and he put a hickey on her. I don\u2019t know what he was doing in her apartment.' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said: 'This lengthy prison sentence reflects the extremely violent nature of this attack, in which Kevin Mitchell raped a woman in her own home. 'I would like to thank the survivor for coming forward, and my office\u2019s Sex Crimes prosecutors for ensuring that this predator will serve years behind bars.' Prosecutor Siobhan Carty told Manhattan Supreme Court that Mitchell surreptitiously entered the woman's apartment on September 19, 2013 at 5.30am and threatened her with a knife and said he had a gun. After the attack, the victim rang 911 and NYPD's Warrant Squad arrested Mitchell four days later. Ms Carty read the victim's statement into the court record in advance of Mitchell's sentencing. She said on behalf of the victim: 'This man has completely ruined my life. I have tried to rationalise what I could have done in my life to have deserved what happened to me. The only conclusion that I have come up with is that some people in this world are truly terrible.' 'I cannot understand why the man did this to me. Why he told me he would kill me if I didn\u2019t do what he said. 'I do not know if he raped me because I only had $24, or if that was the initial reason that he broke into my apartment. If he had broken into my apartment to assault me, then why did he make me talk to him for so long? 'I was trapped in my own home for what felt like forever talking to this man and not knowing if he was going to kill me or my dog \u2014 he made it clear to me that he was very capable of both.' Mitchell has been told he can remain on Rikers Island, pictured, until next month so he can marry his girlfriend Tyneka Hudson and receive conjugal visits when he is sent to a prison in upstate New York. The statement added: 'I gave him so many chances to leave. I told him multiple times that if he left right then nothing bad would happen. He raped me anyways.'

Hart works with Aguero on a day-to-day basis at Manchester City and is impressed with what he's seen. \u2018From working with him on a daily basis and from what I've seen this season, Aguero just knows how to score,\u2019 Hart explained. \u2018In training he particularly excites you most days but he's also got that ability on the day to do it. We've got a good team, but a long clearance could turn into a goal because he's got that ability to take it round five people and score. \u2018It's a great thing to have. Sergio is a very natural player and in a situation one-on-one there is nothing complicated about it. He takes that option to score. Messi is absolutely awesome, he is a phenomenal player, but I'm backing Sergio.\u2019 Messi is denied by Hart at the Nou Camp during City's Champions League exit to Barcelona last week.

The sensor uses advanced software and predictive algorithms to identify when levels of a gas or compound are beyond what is considered normal. The sensor can also be used to detect compounds released by rotting food, and could be used in a smartphone to send results to a doctor automatically.", "article": "Doctors  stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery. And in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone. A San Francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person\u2019s breath that could hint at an underlying illness. Doctor in a stick? The very early model of the sensor (pictured) has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies. The very early model of the sensor has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released either through everyday metabolic activity, or by diseases in the body. Once created, they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. Some compounds, including carbon for instance, are released naturally. BoydSense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal. It uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean. It is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. If the sensor is added to a smartphone, for example, a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically. In particular, the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, Mr Thuillier said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. In the MailOnline demo, the BoydSense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds. BoydSense\u2019s boss Bruno Thuillier gave MailOnline a demo of the technology at Mobile World Congress. The current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth - although Mr Thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves. It takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise, a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous \u2018sniffs\u2019. This process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version, however. For the demo, the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges. Within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone. This was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities, but Mr Thuillier explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential. If attached to a smartphone, the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best-before date, or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn. Mr Thuillier said: \u2018I am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere, anytime. This platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness. BoydSense aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics.\u2019", "candidates": [["San Francisco-based BoydSense has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person's breath that could hint at an underlying illness.

A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview. The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions. 'Now, it\u2019s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: \u201cYou can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up. London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her. With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her. Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air. Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I).

Tests revealed the shipment, which weighed 554 kilograms, had more than 35 times the safe levels of radioactivity. Around 30 crates of feminine hygiene products were seized Friday at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut after electronic scanners detected radioactivity in the shipment. The sanitary pads had originated in China, and arrived at the airport Friday from Dubai, officials said. After  failing to pass the radioactivity scanner test at the airport, the shipment's contents were examined at the Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission. The\u00a0Lebanon\u00a0Minister for Finance, the department which is responsible for customs, told Al-Joumhouriya newspaper:\u00a0'As a result of the examination of a number of boxes that contained sanitary pads, it appeared that the rate of radioactivity inside them was 35 times more than is permitted.' A half ton shipment of radioactive sanitary products, which were more than 35 times the safe level of radiation, was discovered by customs officials at a Lebanon airport. The sanitary towels were manufactured by Anion\u00a0which\u00a0purports the health benefits of anions- groups of\u00a0negatively charged ionized atoms. It is not known, but it may be possible the source of the radiation came from the production process. Ionization happens when atoms are given high-energy ionizing radiation, electrical voltage or high temperature. Atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles and are also radioactive. On the company website, Anions claim their pads and pantyliners contain an anion layer which 'emits intensive anion stream beneficial to human health in amount up to 5800 for cm3.' They go onto claims that anions are 'air vitamins' and'significantly benefit to human health and daily routine' boosting the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems.

Despite the mistake, the groom invited him anyway and DiJulio set up a GoFundMe page to cover his travel expenses. After seeing a picture of DiJulio, the party members noticed he could be related to the groom and DiJulio revealed he had been to a wedding for a friend who now lives on the east coast.", "article": "You've heard of wedding crashers. Joey DiJulio is a bachelor party crasher - of sorts. For weeks, the father-of-one from the Seattle suburbs found himself getting emails from people he didn't know about a bachelor party 2,800 miles away in Philadelphia and a groom he's never met. He saw names of the city's landmarks like Reading Terminal Market thrown around in the emails but couldn't put his finger on where they were located until he searched the names online. The wrong guest: Joey DiJulio of Burien, Washington, started receiving emails from people he had never met about a bachelor party. He then came clean about the mistake, but the groom decided to invite him anyway. 'I had no idea what any of these places are,' said DiJulio, 31, who's never been to the Northeast. 'After Googling them, everything was pointing to Philadelphia.' It turns out DiJulio, an information technology worker and a married father of one in Burien, Washington, had been mistaken for a friend of the groom with a similar last name. He sat as a 'fly on the wall' for much of the email chain until Monday, when he broke the news after the groom's brother wanted a headcount of people attending the party. But it didn't end there. Groom Jeff Minetti, 34, figured: Why not still invite him? The Philadelphia real estate agent asked him to attend both the bachelor party March 28 and his wedding May 2 in New Jersey. 'This is the city of brotherly love,' Minetti said, even telling DiJulio he could be his best man. 'Any and all are welcome.' The groom: When those who were invited to the bachelor party saw a picture of Joey DiJulio they said he could actually be related to the groom - Jeff Minetti. DiJulio went online and set up a GoFundMe\u00a0page to tell his story and raise money to cover his travel. In less than a week, he's already hit his goal of a little more than $1,200 and is putting any more money raised toward Minetti's honeymoon. The groom promises the bachelor party will be a low-key affair at some bars, maybe a casino, to watch March Madness unfold. And while he won't actually get to be the best man \u2014 that's reserved for Minetti's 11-year-old cousin \u2014 DiJulio has his plane ticket ready to go for next weekend to see a city he's never been to and hang out with a group of guys he's never met. He set up a GoFundMe page when he learned he was invited, and has since raised more than $2,000. From the groom Jeff Minetti:. People,. Has anyone else noticed now that Jeff has been rocking the beard for a while - he looks like a middle aged Pavarotti? At times, he also has ventured into a bit of hipster phase. In addition to publicly questioning his fashion choices, his bachelor party will be a good time for us to celebrate him leading up to his wedding. Joe DiJulio finally comes clean:. Hi All,. So, I have no idea who any of you guys are, but I have been enjoying being a fly on the wall hearing about the plans for this bachelor party over the last few months. I'm assuming my E-Mail address was added to the list by mistake (perhaps a typo of someone else?). I live out in Seattle, WA and although for a moment I thought it might be funny to just show up and be that guy nobody knows but everyone wonders \"who is that guy?\", buying a plane ticket for a cross-country flight just to crash a bachelor's party might be a bit over the top (although it would be epic!). Nonetheless, I do hope you guys have a great time and I'd like to take a moment to wish the best of luck in life to the groom! Cheers! Joey DiJulio. Seattle, WA. Members of the party start to reply. I say everyone forks up an extra $20 and we get Joey a plane ticket to Philly! and. I just facebooked Joey DiJulio in WA, and if this is you - you actually look like you could be related to groom. MIND BLOWN. Mr DiJuio replies about the picture on Facebook. Haha... Yes, that is indeed me with my (now 2-year old, she was about 3-months there) daughter, Kaylee. Speaking of bachelor parties, weddings, and the like, that shot was actually taken at a wedding for a buddy of mine who also, coincidentally, happens to now live out on the east coast (Boston). Small world! Indeed, I think I recall seeing a picture of the groom over the last few months, and noticed this as well. I'm of course glad to know he's a studly guy - His soon-to-be-wife is a lucky woman!

Kemeys Folly, in Langstone, near Newport in South Wales, starred in the popular Channel 4 programme six years ago when it was converted into a six-bedroom luxury house - and now owners Sarah and Dean Berry have put the unusual property up for sale. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of a castellated 18th Century hunting lodge with the construction of a state of-the-art glass extension. Scroll down for video. Kemeys Folly (pictured) starred in popular property show Grand Designs six years ago. Its owners have now put the unusual home up for sale. Owners Sarah and Dean Berry have now put the unusual Grade II listed six-bedroom home up for sale for \u00a31,999,950. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of the old hunting lodge with a state of-the-art glass extension. The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the tower in 2005, which was being sold by a couple who had quickly realised that there was far too much work to do, and put it back on the market. Work on Kemeys started in January 2007 and over the next year an old extension was demolished, the outside of the tower was re-pointed and the inside was stripped as much as the building's listed status would allow. Now, The Grade II listed home boasts six bedrooms, five of which have en-suite bathrooms - and including a master bedroom which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. Sitting in 23 acres of land the property also boasts a cinema room in the older part of the building and outside there is a large pool house with swimming pool and changing facilities. The folly also has four stables which back directly onto a paddock. The glass extension takes full advantage of the stunning hilltop location - on a clear day you can see 11 counties as well as the two Severn road bridges and the Bristol Channel. The owners say the surrounding woodland is perfect for long walks, and which features lots of wildlife, including deer. Something of a local landmark, the original building was a hunting lodge dating back to the 1700s and was at one point owned by the Sheriff of Monmouth. The folly is situated in the heart of the Usk Valley in South Wales and has a roof terrace which enjoys this view over the  countryside. The house boasts a master bedroom and en suite which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. It was struck by lightning in 1890, rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and was eventually converted into a house for the Sheriff of Monmouth. The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the folly in 2005 and spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it and bringing it up to scratch. Mrs Berry said: 'We bought it with a view to carrying out significant work on it, renovating the tower and extending it. 'It was one of those love at first sight moments. We were in London at the time but knew we wanted to move back here to where we grew up. 'Neither of us even knew it existed but when we saw it we wanted it. It was just outstanding.' The couple spent a huge amount of time with planners to agree on a concept for the home that everyone was happy with. She said: 'The idea was to keep the original features of the main building, such as the beautiful exposed stonework, but not to mimic what was already there in the extension. 'We wanted to create new sections that helped to tell the story of the building through the years and were an expression of the 21st century. 'Living here has been such fun.' A former hunting lodge, the folly was built in 1712 by local landowner George Kemeys. It was struck by lightning in the late 1890s, partially rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and converted into a house for TE Watson, the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. The couple are selling as they are downsizing but say: 'Whoever takes Kemeys Folly on now is going to enjoy such an amazing life here.' The house is for sale for \u00a31,999,950 with Chewton Rose.

The 40lb shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador named after Sir Barnes Wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb. His owner, John Brewin, phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in Sandwich Bay, Kent, on Sunday. Scroll down for video. Dramatic: The seven shells were detonated by bomb experts out at sea at Sanwich Bay, Kent. Explosion: The shells,\u00a0which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador. Sniffed out: Barnes Wallis the black Labrador. Experts from the Royal Logistics Corps Bomb Disposal Team arrived and, with Barnes' help, uncovered another six shells.

'The seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb Black Powder shells. 'The first one was found by my black Labrador Barnes Wallis and the others were then located by the local Coastguard Team, assisted by Barnes again.' Mr Brewin named his dog after Sir Barnes Wallis, a British aviation engineer who invented the 'bouncing bomb' used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Adrian Hendry, 43, who lives nearby, said: 'The explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast. 'It's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after Barnes Wallis - an amazing coincidence really.' Uncovered: Bomb disposal experts arrived and, with Barnes' help, found another six shells on the beach. Curious: Owner John Brewin said the shells, pictured, are not the first to be dug up by his pet. Sir Barnes Wallis: Inventor of the 'bouncing bomb' Barnes Wallis was a British aviation engineer who is famous for designing the 'bouncing bomb' that was used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Born in Derbyshire, Wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft. When the Second World War began, Wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at Vickers' engineering. He came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter's marbles across a tub of water by catapault. But it took more than a year to convince RAF chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted. Once he was given the go-ahead, he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design. The final solution, called Upkeep, was a cylindrical bomb, weighing four tons, spinning backwards at 500 rpm. It had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph. In the dark. In the middle of hilly, forested west German territory. Operation Chastise, dubbed the 'Dambusters Raid' was carried out overnight on the 16 May 1943 by the 617 Squadron of the RAF - specially-created for the job - that was led by Guy Gibson. Two of the dams were breached, leading to serious flooding of the surrounding area. However, it did not make a significant dent in the country's industrial production, as hoped. The most significant outcome of the raid was the positive effect it had on morale - giving Allied troops, and those left at home, a much-needed boost.

Judge Deborah Sweeney said on Friday the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. He then'married her' before he sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions between January 11 and February 5 last year. The Australian girl was pregnant when her 26-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. A 27-year-old man has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars. The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW,\u00a0in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the man told the court today that 'his cultural and religious beliefs doesn't excuse his behaviour'. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, the girl was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and then miscarried in February after complaining of  abdominal pain. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. The man pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court in October to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence. The 27-year-old Lebanese student and the 12-year-old Australian girl spent their wedding night as a motel in the Hunter region of NSW where they had sex several times. The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged. He was ordered not to contact his victim for two years. Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier last year. The girl's father will face trial this year. The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly arranged the illegal marriage. The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He was charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013 \u00a0after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl\u2019s legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits.

As he launches a poster showing a tiny Ed Miliband in Mr Salmond\u2019s pocket, the Prime Minister warns of the \u2018chilling and real prospect\u2019 of Labour being propped up in government by the Scottish National Party. His offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament. Scroll down for video. Pocket-size: Ed Miliband is dwarfed by Alex Salmond in the new Conservative election poster. Polls last week suggested the nationalists could win 50 out of the 59 Westminster seats in May, including those seen as the safest Labour strongholds such as Gordon Brown\u2019s in Kirkcaldy. This would sink any prospect of Mr Miliband winning a Commons majority. Mr Cameron says today: \u2018Britain needs to wake up to a chilling and real prospect \u2013 Ed Miliband as prime minister, propped up by Alex Salmond who says he\u2019ll call the tune. \u2018Again and again, Ed Miliband refuses to rule out this possibility. He is so weak, everyone knows he would be in Alex Salmond\u2019s pocket. On every vote, every budget, every decision, the SNP would exact a high price for his support. \u2018Everyone in Britain will pay with higher taxes, more spending, more debt and weaker defences in dangerous times. To keep the recovery on track and avoid this nightmare, vote Conservative.\u2019 The Prime Minister's\u00a0offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament. A Labour parliamentary candidate has rejected a \u00a31,000 donation from Tony Blair towards her election campaign. Lesley Brennan, who is standing in Dundee East, said on Twitter her \u2018instinct\u2019 was to turn the offer down. The former Prime Minister has pledged \u00a3106,000 to help Labour campaigns in 106 marginal seats. But there has been unease about Mr Blair\u2019s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so-called \u2018blood money\u2019. Mr Miliband is under huge pressure from his Scottish MPs to rule out a deal with the nationalists. Yesterday his deputy Harriet Harman dodged the issue eight times on the Murnaghan show on Sky. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1. She said: \u2018We are focused on winning a Labour majority government. Let me say this. We do not want, we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the SNP.\u2019 Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan dodged the question four times on Pienaar\u2019s Politics on Radio 5 Live and shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran did so nine times on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics. On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could \u2018call the tune\u2019 in the Commons. \u2018It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,\u2019 he said. \u2018Neither are fit to govern. \u2018It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.\u2019 At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent. Labour MPs say the party has \u2018decided internally\u2019 not to rule out an SNP pact before the election. This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10. Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories\u2019 latest poster. Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk. The poster\u2019s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed \u2018Big Eck and Little Ed\u2019. The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV\u2019s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s.

Hundreds of visitors have flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, after the face of Jesus appeared after a landslide. Now some local landowners are cashing in by charging visitors to view the holy image, according to a local newspaper.

The image has also been making the rounds on social media since Saturday.\u00a0But not everyone was impressed with the'miracle'.

Nurse Alex Cotton, 38, found an image of Jesus in a drainpipe at her home in Coventry, West Midlands which was dubbed 'the Second plumbing'. Bank worker Toby Elles claimed he was saved by divine intervention when he woke to find a burning frying pan on his cooker. On further inspection of his singed bacon snack he also found the face of the Son of God burnt to the bottom of the pan.

In the U.S., Mary Jo Coady, a medical secretary from Massachusetts made a similar discovery burned on her iron while doing housework. The 44-year-old said the image immediately renewed her faith in God. Drinkers at the Tanners Hall pub in Darlington, County Durham, were stunned to see the face of Christ in the foil top of a Bulmers cider bottle. And mother-of-three Claire Allen, 36, found the Saviour's friendly features in the lid of a jar of Marmite which was smeared with the yeast-based spread. She said: 'I opened the Marmite jar and the lid caught my eye. Immediately I thought, that's Jesus. 'It wasn't a new jar, but I'd never noticed that before.' The face of Christ appears in a crumpled sock (left) while the image appears in a burnt on stain on an iron (right) Ms Allen, of Ystrad, Rhondda, South Wales, showed the lid to her older boys Jamie, 14, and Tomas, 11. 'They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said. Sarah Crane, from Orpington, was stunned when she hung her laundry out to dry and discovered the face of Jesus staring back at her from a crumpled sock. Miss Crane was so impressed by the clarity of the face she even built a shrine to the holy image. 'I'd left the washing out to dry overnight - and it had probably been sitting there a bit too long when I noticed the face in the sock,' she said. 'I called my boyfriend over straight away - we could both clearly see the face of Jesus in the sock. There is a straight-on face, and a side profile too - we couldn't believe it. 'We think it's a bit of a sign - but for what we don't know.' An image of  Jesus Christ also appeared on a tree stump in a Belfast cemetery.

{"abstract": "The traditional bar of soap is declining in popularity as more people are opting for liquid hand wash and hand sanitiser.

The soap, bath and shower category has experienced declining sales over the past two years, falling from \u00a3660 million in 2012 to an estimated \u00a3638 million in 2014.", "article": "The future of the humble bar of soap may in be hot water as more people are choosing to use liquid hand wash and hand sanitiser. Baths were also on the decline with more people opting for a quick shower over a long soak, according to a new report. Despite falling sales of the traditional bar of soap, people are actually washing more with over a third of adults are washing their hands more often than they were a year ago. The proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014. Experts believe the nation's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over international health scares such as last year's Ebola outbreak. Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel, said: 'With health scares making headlines around the world throughout 2014, the spread of disease has raised awareness of how hand hygiene plays a part in preventing infection, causing an increase in the frequency of consumers washing their hands.' Professor Vincent-Wayne Mitchell, a consumer marketing specialist at the Cass Business School in London, added that years of MRSA oubreaks and food hygiene scares had made people 'hygiene hyperconscious.' The proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014. Research by Mintel found that 87 per cent of people are more likely to purchase liquid soap than bar soap, 71 per cent. More than half of us also use hand sanitiser gel, with a third buying it once a month or more. Professor Isabelle Szmigin, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Birmingham, said the shift to liquid soap was 'purely an improvement' 'The large majority of young Brits purchasing hand sanitiser shows that, despite preconceptions, this group have a particularly cautious attitude towards spreading germs,' added Ms Libby. Humans have been using soap for thousands of years. The earliest bar discovered dates back to around 2800 BC in ancient Babylon. The first mass-market transparent soap was Pears, which was first sold in 1807. Professor Isabelle Szmigin, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Birmingham, said the shift to liquid soap was 'purely an improvement'. 'This is what we call a continuous innovation, where the basic formula is the same but the product is better,' she said. Shower washes were the most frequently purchased body cleansing product of 2014, as they were the previous year, with one in five taking less baths than they did a year ago. Ms Libby said: 'Consumers have started to realise that being environmentally friendly can translate to money-saving and are making greener choices to benefit their own pockets.' Experts believe the nation's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over health scares such as last year's Ebola outbreak. Young men, aged 16-24, were the most likely to still choose a bath over a shower\u00a0with a quarter claiming that the bath is their cleaning method of choice, compared to the national average of 19 per cent. One in five men young men said they are taking more baths compared to three years ago with a quarter of describing the bathroom as their'sanctuary.' Prof Mitchell said the increasing use of baths by young men reflects the rise of male grooming and the metrosexual phenomenon. 'Young men can prove an important target for innovation in the soap, bath and shower sector, and could be encouraged into habits that they maintain as they age,' Ms Libby concluded.

{"abstract": "Kris Commons initially had difficulty adapting to the changes brought by Ronny Deila when he took over as Celtic manager, but has since built a strong relationship with him. Deila has encouraged his players to be physically fitter, and Commons has responded positively to the challenge. He has signed a new contract and is determined to win more trophies and play in the Champions League in the coming years.", "article": "Peter Lawwell called it the \u2018Le Guen hump\u2019 and for certain Celtic players the chief executive\u2019s words might be tweaked to read \u2018taking the hump\u2019. It\u2019s to his credit that, with typical candour, Kris Commons admits he had teething problems with the regime change that saw Ronny Deila walk into Celtic intent on wholesale reform. Lawwell knew that by appointing the Norwegian in the wake of Neil Lennon\u2019s resignation he was taking a risk, and recently likened the gamble to Rangers\u2019 decision to install Paul Le Guen in 2006. After a difficult start, Kris Commons has now build a strong relationship with Celtic manager Ronny Deila. The Frenchman lasted barely six months at Ibrox and departed in the wake of a dressing-room revolt. Yet, while the likes of Kris Boyd and Barry Ferguson actively railed against Le Guen\u2019s methods, the resistance to Deila\u2019s changes was more subtle. There was, however, bemusement that the club should seek to change the winning formula that had seen Lennon land three titles in a row alongside consecutive qualifications for the Champions League group stage. Having clinched the major Player of the Year honours and scored 32 times last season, Commons more than most was perhaps entitled to feel his game had little need for refinement. He readily admits to feeling unsettled by the changes that saw the former Stromsgodset chief place a greater emphasis on fitness as he attempted to realise a high-tempo pressing game. As with most human squabbles, communication has proved the key to a solution. Deila\u2019s policy of regularly sitting down to speak individually with his players has given Commons a right of reply and he has used it, returning to first-team prominence and signing a new contract last month. Commons has adapted well to the manager's demands of his players to be physically fitter than before. Commons is likely to start the League Cup Final and has declared himself all in as Deila bids to win his first trophy as Celtic manager. \u2018It is always difficult when you feel like you\u2019ve come off a season doing really well then someone comes in and wants to change things, as he sees it, for the better,\u2019 he said. \u2018But through that transitional period we got knocked out the Champions League and didn\u2019t get off to a great start in the league. It had an effect on the park. \u2018I wasn\u2019t playing every week and, when I was in, I\u2019d try to do the things the manager wanted. In recent weeks, when I have been fit and healthy, I\u2019ve felt like a different player and added more to my game than usual. \u2018We speak one-to-one on a regular basis about what he wants and what I want. He\u2019s good that way, super. He\u2019s not telling me anything I don\u2019t know already, it\u2019s just sometimes you need a push in the right direction to make you a better player.\u2019 Bright, articulate and possessed with a healthy sense of his own ability, Commons is one of the bigger characters in the dressing room and it was always crucial that Deila found a way to bring the Mansfield-born attacking midfielder on side. Even Lennon had a rocky spell with Commons during the player\u2019s first full season at the club but the pair went on to forge a productive working relationship to the extent that the Northern Irishman admitted he would happily take Commons off Deila\u2019s hands as he settled into his new job at Bolton. Commons talks with captain Scott Brown in training ahead of the Scottish League cup final on Sunday. A return to the Championship, where the 31-year-old had performed comfortably and without the incessant pressure to win inherent at Celtic, would have been an easier and possibly more lucrative option. \u2018I\u2019m not looking for an easy way out,\u2019 he contends. \u2018I wasn\u2019t looking just to plod away through these next two or three years. I have a lot of goals for myself \u2014 to win more trophies, more cups. I want to win a Treble and play in the Champions League these next couple of years. I\u2019ve not signed a deal where I think: \u201cOh, that\u2019s great, I can get my feet up\u201d. \u2018The manager will put pressure on me to keep improving, so I\u2019ve got to show signs of doing that and that\u2019s one of my goals \u2014 I want to get better as a player as I get older.\u2019 Commons admits he is \u2018three to four kilos\u2019 lighter thanks to Deila\u2019s demands that his players cut their body fat and admits he feels fitter as a result.

Brown said that Bobbi Kristina was 'doing really well' and that he was working on his memoirs and a final album.

But Bobby Brown appeared on a talk show today selling his barbecue sauce - and saying that Bobbi Kristina was 'doing really well'. The pre-recorded segment of Queen Latifah was accompanied by a brief on-screen warning that the interview was 'previously recorded'. But it was not shown throughout the segment, which was broadcast on network affiliate stations around the country. Daily Mail Online has reached out to Sony Pictures, which produces the Queen Latifah show to ask why it was aired. Warning: Viewers were told briefly when Bobby brown arrived on the Queen Latifah show that it was made before his daughter was found drowned in her bath tub. In the course of his appearance,\u00a0Brown said that his daughter was 'great' and busy working on her music. He joked about how he doesn't like working out and said that Bobbi Kristina had 'the voice of her mother'. But the decision to air it regardless will be seen by many to be in bad taste. Bobbi Kristina is currently unconscious in an Atlanta hospital room after she was found unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31 in a chilling echo of how her mother Whitney Houston died. Her family have said she is'still fighting' but reports have claimed that she could suffer from serious brain damage if she ever manages to leave the hospital. Pictures this week showed Brown, 46, looking forlorn with his eyes puffy beneath a beanie as he grappled with the tragedy that has befallen his family. Distraught: Bobby Brown earlier this week in a state of apparent distress and exhaustion after visiting his daughter. Promotion: Brown was on the show to push his range of barbecue sauces. But since his daughter's drowning he has been at the hospital where she is fighting for her life. But on the Queen Latifah show he seemed relaxed and in good humor. With a smile on his face, Brown cooked some shrimp and rice for Latifah to show off his range of barbecue sauces, which he launched last summer. Brown said: 'Smell it! 'When you smell good food, that's when you go into a place to eat, when you can smell it from outside. Fresh peppers and herbs and garlic.' Asked how things are going with his family, Brown said: 'Everybody's great. 'Two of my sons are working on LPs. They drive me crazy, but, you know. They do their thing and I just stand to the side. 'My oldest daughter LaPrincia is still in school getting her masters and I'm so proud of her. Cooking: Brown was also seen working on his range of sauces before making small talk with Queen Latifah. Together: Bobbi Kristina and her father Bobby brown pictured together when she was younger. Ordeal: Bobbi Kristina is in hospital while her boyfriend Nick Gordon is at odds with her father. 'Bobbi Kristina, who everybody knows, she's doing really well. 'Working on her music, I'm so proud of her. I am so proud of her. She has the voice of her mother and the legs of her father.' Brown added that his late wife's performance album had just come out - it was released in November last year - and that he was thinking of quitting music. He said: 'I've decided to, I don't know, the music business has gotten so strange that I plan on recording probably the last album and I'm gunna call it. 'I'm 45 years old. Forty five years old! I feel it one good last album and I want to go and sit with my grandchildren and just chill. 'You have to understand, I've been doing this for almost 35 years, my legs are tired. I love dancing and singing, it's just the workout part. 'Alright, alright, two miles is enough, to be on a treadmill and lifting weights. It's all cool to be healthy but, it's not really cool when you don't wanna do it no more.' Brown added that he was also working on his memoirs so 'people know the truth about my life'.

{"abstract": "Oil workers recently unearthed the remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago in Siberia. Scientists debate what caused the extinction of mammoths, with theories ranging from human hunting to climate change. Dozens of mammoth remains have been found in Siberia, including entire skeletons and mummified bodies still preserved in the ice.", "article": "The remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in Siberia by oil workers. Two tusks, teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles (50km) from Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia. Oil workers had been digging at a site owned by Rosneft close to the town when they noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket. Ancient: Two mammoth tusks (shown above) together with fragments of jaw, teeth, tibia and ribs were dug from the frozen soil of Siberia.\u00a0Oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket. Using shovels they then unearthed a second tust, a tibia, ribs, teeth and fragments of the animal's jaw. Aton Rezvy, head of palaeontology at the Khanty-Mansiysk Museum of Nature and Man, said he believes the mammoth is at least 10,000 years old. Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths. All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence. However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths. Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction. He estimated that the giant animal had been a fully grown adult female, around 30 to 40 years old when she died. He said they hoped to conduct further analysis of the bones to learn more about the mammoth. He told the Siberian Times: 'We can send the find to determine the radiocarbon date. 'Genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - European or North American.' Recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in Siberia may have originated in North Ameria and migrated across the Bering Strait when sea levels were lower. Many believe the original Siberian population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago, with North American mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago. The exact reason for their extinction is still debated with many blaming changes to the climate as causing their demise. Others have pointed to evidence that humans and neanderthals hunted the giant creatures along with other ice age megafauna and may have pushed them to the brink of extinction. Palaeontologists who examined the mammoth's remains (shown above) estimate it died 10,000 years ago. Oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from Nyagan in Russia (above) when they found the mammoth. They estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female, around 30 to 40 years old. A recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western Europe around 30,000 years ago. Just a few isolated populations of mammoth are though to have clung on. Dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in Siberia, including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice. The mammoth's remains were unearthed about 30 miles from the town of Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia. Vladimir Bednyakov (pictured above) had been operating the digger when he unearthed the mammoth tusks. Vladimir Bednyakov was operating the excavator when he discovered the latest mammoth. He said: 'I noticed something in the excavator bucket. It turned to be a mammoth tusk. 'We have the rule - if we find something, we stop the work and call the bosses. 'But I was also interested myself, in what this was. 'I took the shovel and began to dig.... found more remains, the second tusk, teeth and other bones.'

The Radio 4 drama's village of Ambridge, based in the fictional West Midlands county of Borsetshire, was flooded in the latest sensational storyline. Accompanying the show were live minute-by-minute updates of the floods on the BBC website, including weather forecasts and 'breaking news' headlines - but listeners said the graphics were 'insulting'. The BBC faced a deluge of complaints from listeners over its bizarre online coverage of a fictional flood disaster in The Archers, which included maps and graphics on the corporation's website. A fake BBC weather forecast showed rain falling on the fictional village of Ambridge, near Birmingham. This week's episodes of The Archers have followed events taking place over one day of severe rainfall in Ambridge, with the drama building throughout the day as the River Am burst its banks. The BBC put out fake tweets and warnings from the Environment Agency, as farmland around the fictional village became inundated with water - mirroring the flooding of the Somerset Levels this time last year. The rolling coverage included maps and graphics to help listeners understand what was happening, but some listeners said visual aids 'insulted their intelligence'. Some listeners added that they could not understand what was going on because of the loud background noise of rainfall and heavy winds. Echoing the floods in Somerset last year, the BBC live coverage reported farmers rapidly trying to protect their land and even linked to a real-life account of floods in Worcester. Under a 'breaking news' headline, the online update said a character on the programme was given CPR. A realistic weather forecast also appeared on the minute-by-minute internet coverage, but listeners said it insulted their intelligence. The BBC put out fake tweets and warnings from the Environment Agency, as farmland around Ambridge became inundated with water. In other developments on the Radio 4 drama, 16-year-old character Phoebe Aldridge went missing but was later found, and Rob Titchener was injured as he saved three people from flooded stables. The rolling updates on the BBC website included a video  forecast by Midlands Today weather presenter Rebecca Wood, who warned people to be wary of floodwater and severe winds. Many listeners were unimpressed by the programme's online coverage, with some taking to forums to brand it 'insulting' and confusing. One fan wrote: 'It would 'help' me to feel I was regarded as an adult who knows this is all fantasy, that the residents of Ambridge do not exist, that they are not actually glugging about in the Am's excess water, rather than be told at the end of the episode that tweets and blogs about the flood from Ambridge residents can be read/heard. 'Cannot stand this cross over between fiction and reality, the fiction should be strong enough to stand in its own right and not need these add-on insults to intelligence.' The programme's storyline mirrored the reality of the flooding of the Somerset Levels (pictured) last year. Echoing the floods in Somerset last year, the BBC live coverage reported farmers rapidly trying to protect their land and even linked to a real-life account of floods in Worcester. Another wrote: 'A friend of mine, a loyal and forgiving listener, told me that when she saw on the Archers Home Page a 'weather forecast' for Ambridge that looks exactly like the real ones that appear on the BBC news pages, she felt really cross, felt that her intelligence was being insulted. 'She loves the fictional programme but knows its not real life and is angry that the programme makers think she is stupid enough to want this sort of nonsense.' Other complaints focused on the storyline being too confusing and background noise being too loud. 'You can't do this on the radio. Just shouting into the mic does not make it a dramatic and gripping storyline. No idea where anyone was half the time, whether they were driving, wading or climbing up the wall,' one listener wrote. A spokesman for The Archers said: 'The flood storyline has been building for some time. 'The Archers has a long tradition of reflecting the agricultural world and the current storyline, which fans will know has been building for over a year, mirrors what farmers across the country experienced in recent floods. 'When developing the script, the writers spoke to real-life farmers and it is their experiences that inspired this week\u2019s events in Ambridge.

The estate was previously a weight-loss spa and was visited by notable guests such as Mamie Eisenhower, Judy Garland, and Ava Gardner.", "article": "The former Maine summer home of beauty magnate Elizabeth Arden has been purchased by a nonprofit dedicated to disabled veterans. The Travis Mills Foundation - named after a former Army staff sergeant who became a quadruple amputee after a 2012 Afghanistan bomb blast  - announced the purchase Tuesday. The foundation said in a release it intends to make extensive renovations to the property and convert it 'into the nation's first fully accessible, \"smart home\" retreat dedicated to serving the recreational and reintegration needs of combat-wounded veterans and their families.' Married to wife Kelsey and father to daughter Chloe, Mills established the foundation bearing his name and is now a motivational speaker. The estate was placed on the market last summer for $765,000, but the foundation did not announce the purchase price. Purchase: The Travis Mills Foundation has  purchased a Maine home that was once Elizabeth Arden's Maine Chance Spa. Off the market:\u00a0The estate was placed on the market last summer for $765,000, but the foundation did not announce the purchase price. Beauty magnate: Arden, seen left,\u00a0built the main house in the town of Rome as her summer estate in the 1920s and later established the Maine Chance Spa at the site. Women are seen on the right at the spa in 1948. New purpose: The Travis Miller Foundation is named after a former Army staff sergeant severely injured in a 2012 Afghanistan bomb blast who became a quadruple amputee. Miller is seen here with his family. Mills told\u00a0The Kennebec Journal\u00a0of the purchase, 'We're definitely excited,' and said that there is no opening date arranged yet. The Travis Mills Foundation is hoping to gather $1.7 million for renovations - and over $27,400 has already been raised, according to a GoFundMe\u00a0page. The page says, 'On April 10, 2012, United States Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills of the 82nd Airborne was critically injured on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan by an IED (improvised explosive device) while on patrol, losing portions of both legs and both arms. \u00a0He is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive such extensive injuries.' Mills received extended treatment from Walter Reed Army Medical Center,\u00a0CNN\u00a0reported last year. Now, he participates in a number of physical activities, including snowboarding, according to the television station. Mills told CNN 'I'm not wounded any more. I'm just a guy living life.' Expansive:\u00a0The property once covered 1,200 acres but was subdivided after Arden's 1966 death. Father: Mills, seen left with his daughter Chloe before the accident, now works as a motivational speaker. Efforts: The foundation has already raised over $27,000 in donations. In a trailer for a\u00a0documentary\u00a0on his life, 'Travis: A Soldier's Story,' Mills said 'You know, people call me a hero, but I'm not sure what part of it makes me a hero. I just had a normal day at work that turned ugly. 'About six seconds [after the explosion] I guess later, I woke up. My medic came running up at me. And about twenty seconds he had tourniquets on both legs and both arms. And I guess the last thing that was in my head was my baby girl. Am I ever going to see her again?' 'My goal was to let them know I keep working, I keep going hard,' he also said in the trailer. 'If I give up, I'm giving up on my family.' Arden built the main house in the town of Rome as her summer estate in the 1920s and later established the Maine Chance Spa at the site. Mamie Eisenhower, Judy Garland, and Ava Gardner were among the guests. The property once covered 1,200 acres but was subdivided after Arden's 1966 death. The Kennebec Journal\u00a0reported last year that the Maine Chance Spa was primarily a weight-loss spa, but also featured a number of beauty treatments. According to the news outlet, the spa had green houses, living spaces for staff, as well as exercise spaces, treatment rooms, and guest lodgings. Stefano Tufano, whose parents purchased the spa in the 1970s, told\u00a0WLBZ in 2014 'You research it and to find out it was the first spa in the history of the United States and all the famous people that stayed here, Judy Garland, the First Lady Maime Eisenhower and you know, it was quite a place. 'In today's money, it was $4,000 a week to stay here. So, it was an exclusive women's club back then, very few people could afford to come here.' Property maintenance led to Tufano wanting to sell, WLBZ reported. Changing lives: Mills poses for a snap with his daughter Chloe, wife Kelsey, and former president George W. Bush.

It has been revealed that the larger kitchen is used by the family's live-in nanny, while the smaller kitchen is mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'. Tory MP Nigel Adams has criticized Miliband for lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion.", "article": "Labour supporters demanding an end to trivial speculation about their leader's kitchen are in for a disappointment: Ed Miliband has invited the cameras into his home again. Days after it emerged his \u00a32million house has a large family kitchen and a smaller 'functional kitchenette' upstairs, ITV is expecting to film him relaxing in at least one of them. Confusion about why the family have two kitchens deepened today, when it emerged that the larger family kitchen picture on Mr Milband's Christmas card last year is in fact used by the live-in nanny. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room. Mr Miliband tried to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements on Friday, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras as part of a short film about his wife, Justine. The poky room the couple were pictured in last week, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed by a family friend to mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail. 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' But now it has emerged that the kitchen will appear on screens again. ITV has already filmed David Cameron and Nick Clegg at home. An ITV told the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Cameron and Clegg have already been filmed in their kitchens and elsewhere and we are due to begin filming in Ed Miliband's home in the next day or two. We were always going to shoot in the family kitchen so we shall have to see what happens.' It was also claimed that the second bigger kitchen is used by the live-in nanny who looks after the couple's children Daniel and Sam. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in the paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen. Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day. Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion.

Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined \u00a32,000 in March 2014 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for Torquay - a charge which he denied. Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities.

{"abstract": "At least seven monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana have been exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei. The cause of the contamination is still unknown, and authorities are concerned that the bacteria may have spread to the surrounding area. Tests are being conducted to determine if the bacteria has colonized in the cages and if livestock and domestic animals have been exposed.", "article": "CDC officials have arrived at a Louisiana research center to try to determine how at least seven monkeys became exposed to a deadly bacteria used in bioweapons. Three of the monkeys had to be euthanized after showing signs of the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre Tulane National Primate Research Center, USA Today reported. Despite thorough investigations by authorities, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened. Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required. Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died. Potentially deadly:\u00a0Burkholderia pseudomallei. The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.", "candidates": [["CDC officials are investigating how at least seven monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei.

'They asked me, could they? I said, `Yeah, I'd be thrilled to help out in any way I could,'' said Nash, a former Connecticut resident who now lives on her own in Boston with the help of part-time aides. Nash lost her nose, lips, eyelids and hands when she was mauled by her employer's 200-pound pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Connecticut. Doctors also had to remove her eyes because of a disease transmitted by the chimp. She later received new facial features taken from a dead woman. She also underwent a double hand transplant, but it failed when her body rejected the tissue. Now blind, Nash spends most of her days listening to AM radio and books on tape - lately, 'War and Peace' - in her modest, second-story apartment.

Monk and new Aston Villa boss Sherwood got to know each other on the same Football Association of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on Saturday with three Barclays Premier League points at stake. Sherwood got his break in management at Tottenham first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to Monk - and the former England midfielder has revived Villa's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the Premier League danger zone and into the semi-final of the FA Cup. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate Garry Monk. Sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the Villa Park managerial hot-seat. 'He's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group,' Monk said at his pre-match press conference. 'You need results to do that but they've got very good players there who obviously weren't playing to their full potential before Tim took over. 'But he's had an instant impact. He's a very honest guy, black and white, and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game. Garry Monk believes himself and Sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities. 'They're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us. 'We've got our own agenda, we want to achieve our best total of 47 points, and I think you've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against Tottenham and Liverpool. 'The actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at Villa.' The pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright, young British managers, even if the 46-year-old Sherwood is actually 10 years older than Monk who celebrated his first anniversary as Swansea boss last month. Swansea manager Monk observes his players during the training session at the Fairwood Training Centre. But Monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences. 'When Tim came in at Spurs he was already within the club at that time, albeit within a different coaching role,' Monk said. 'I came from a playing background into it and I wouldn't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that. 'But we've got the same desire, commitment and principles and are clear in what we want. 'I'm on the same coaching course as Tim and his views on football are very interesting.

Scott Sinclair will come up against his former Swansea teammates during the game at Villa Park. But Sinclair has thrived under Sherwood with three goals in five games and Monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career.

Scroll down for video. Artist Tracey Emin has insisted she is actually'very neat' as she unveiled her controversial \u00a32.54million unmade bed - complete with discarded condoms - on its return to its 'home' at the Tate Britain today. My Bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize and displayed at Tate Britain in 1999. Emin admitted that unlike the chaotic-looking installation, which features empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts, stained sheets and discarded underwear, her bed at home is now a different affair. 'I make my bed every day. It's so boring, it's very neat. I'm really OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder),' she said. Wiping away tears, the artist said that seeing the work - which is now subject to rigorous security in the form of a sensor and a guard to prevent visitors from getting too close - left her emotional. 'I'm 52 nearly. Even though I was quite old when the bed came into fruition I didn't look old or behave old,' she said. 'I'm a bit tearful, it means a lot to me. I feel pathetic but there are things on that bed that have no place in my life any more. 'That bed belonged to a young woman and hopefully in 20 or 30 years' time the bed will be here but I won't probably. 'That's what art's about. It's about a legacy, about making something which goes on without you. 'It's a statement of history and now it's in safe hands... it will never change.' The work, which expressed the artist's suicidal depression following a relationship breakdown, is displayed in its own room alongside two paintings by Francis Bacon and six nude drawings by Emin which she has given to the Tate. Emin said she felt validated seeing the installation on display alongside works by some of Britain's 'greats' after all the criticism about the bed at the time. The controversial artwork was created by Emin in her Waterloo council flat in 1998 and features empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts, stained sheets, discarded underwear, old slippers, a waist belt and even condoms. My Bed was one of the key works of the 1990s Young British Artists (YBA) movement and was bought by millionaire collector Charles Saatchi  for \u00a3150,000 in 2000 before later being sold to Christie's and auctioned. My Bed, which fetched \u00a32.54million at auction last year, is now on a long-term loan to the Tate Britain and will be shown at both Turner Contemporary in Margate - Emin's home town - and Tate Liverpool later this year. 'I love it, why wouldn't I? I was right... It's a good feeling... it feels like home,' she said, later adding that her fellow students at art school had 'thought I was a bit thick'. Earlier in the day, Emin had told photographers: 'I think I look like the cat who got the cream. I feel so happy.' She later added: 'My Bed is a symbol of that time. It was a zeitgeist. It was perfect for that moment. It has captured a part of history.' Pointing to her belt on the installation, she added: 'I would be lucky if it fitted around my thigh now and it used to fit around my waist. 'There are so many things about that bed that don't relate to my life any more. 'It's a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s in a really wild way. It's not just sad, but how that bed came about was through sadness. 'It's also about being in the worst situation in your life and being able to pull through and get out to the other side.' Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, said: 'It's a work we've always wanted to bring into the collection. 'It was quite clear from 1999 when it was first seen in the Turner prize that it was going to be regarded as one of those iconic works from the late 90s.' Emin insisted she was actually'very neat' as she unveiled the return of My Bed at the Tate today. The 51-year-old said the artwork (part of which is pictured right) was 'a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s' My Bed\u00a0fetched \u00a32.54m at auction, a record for the artist, when it was purchased by dealer and White Cube gallery owner Jay Jopling last year.

{"abstract": "Scientists have re-analysed rocks at the Clearwater Lakes in Canada and found that the two craters were formed by two separate asteroids at vastly different times. The East crater is thought to be 450 million years old and the West crater is 285 million years old. The impacts were not big enough to cause much chaos on a global scale and likely had no significant effect on life.", "article": "Two neighbouring ancient craters thought to be have been formed by the same impact event are now thought to have been created by two separate asteroids. The extremely unlikely formation theory was reached after scientists re-analysed rocks at the site, and found dates for the two were vastly different. While both had been thought to be 285 million years old, it now appears one of the craters is actually 450 million years old but, by chance, was created in almost exactly the same spot. Scroll down for video. The two Clearwater Lake craters in Canada may not have been formed by a binary asteroid. Its thought the East crater asteroid impacted a marine environment during the Ordovician period, 490 million years ago. The West crater was created in the Permian period 285 million years ago and impacted the landmass Pangaea. Researchers from the University of Western Australia say the Clearwater lakes in Canada were formed by two separate events in a 'pure coincidence'. The remarkable finding, if confirmed, has important implications for other so-called 'doublet' craters in the solar system, previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time. And the huge difference in time between the two events is even more amazing as, at the time the first crater was made, the location of the second was underwater. The research was published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta and reported by Astrobiology Magazine. Impacts that leave behind a 62-mile (100km) diameter crater or less, such as those that struck the Clearwater lakes, are widely thought to have no global effects. In fact, impacts can even increase biodiversity. For example, the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, which saw an explosion in the number of animal species around 470 million years ago, has been linked to frequent impact events at the time. This is possibly due to the fact that an impact could disrupt local life just enough to let another species dominate, or because slowly cooling craters can provide habitats for life. Even if the Clearwater Lakes impacts were caused by a double impact, the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the Earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life. While the fireball and earthquake would have decimated any life within a few hundred kilometers, the impacts were not big enough to cause much chaos on a global scale. The Clearwater lakes in Canada are a pair of lakes labelled as West and East. The smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles (26km) in diameter, while the western crater is about 22 miles (36km). In the original theory, a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago. But the researchers say the original methods used to date the East lake, by measuring amounts of argon-40, were inaccurate. Upon analysing new samples at the site, they found a maximum age of 460 million years, far older than the West Clearwater Lake, which is 285 million years old. 'The close spatial arrangement of the two Clearwater Lakes is most likely pure coincidence,' the researchers wrote in their paper. A similar figure was reached by researchers in 1990 by a separate research team, but at the time the findings were dismissed as incorrect due to a supposed contamination from excess argon. But with four different rock samples from various parts of the lake now studied, the researchers say it is highly unlikely they would all yield the same false age. 'We think that the accurate age for the East Clearwater crater was, in fact, already measured back in 1990,' said geologist and lead author Dr Martin Schmieder of the university. The smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles (26km) in diameter, while the western crater is about 22 miles (36km).\u00a0In the original theory, a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago, but that is now believed to be inaccurate. The remarkable finding, if confirmed, has important implications for other so-called 'doublet' craters in the solar system, previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time. Shown is a map of the location of the Clearwater Lakes. It's unlikely that the event that formed the Clearwater Lakes had any significant impact on life.\u00a0Even if the Clearwater Lakes impacts were caused by a double impact, the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the Earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life. Further evidence for the latest findings comes from the amount of chlorine in the two craters. This part of Canada - referred to as Laurentia - had less land 460 million years ago than it did 285 million years ago, when waters receded, forming the landmass called Pangaea. The rocks from the East crater have more chlorine than the West crater, suggesting they formed on a coastline when water was still abundant in the area.

Peacock has won a record eight Super League Grand Finals as well as making over 500 appearances for Leeds, Bradford, Yorkshire, England and Great Britain. The Leeds prop will retire from playing at the end of the season and take up his new role at the club. He was named Man of Steel in 2003 and stepped down as England captain in 2012 to concentrate on his club career and will complete a 10th and final campaign with his home-town club. He was awarded the MBE three years ago for services to the sport. Leeds say Peacock was offered an off-field role at Headingley but wanted a fresh challenge. Peacock said: 'I have had a great time at Leeds and learnt so much about how the club is run from top to bottom. 'The Rhinos are a blueprint for a successful sporting business and the challenge for me now is to take those lessons and try and implement my own thoughts in a new environment. 'Hull KR are a club with huge potential within a city that is rugby league mad and having invested wisely in their facilities in recent years. I know a number of people over there already and I am looking forward to working with Chris Chester, Willie Poching, Mike Smith and Neil Hudgell in my new role. Peacock was England captain a few years ago but is excited about his new off-field role. 'Whenever we have gone over there to play, it is clear Rovers have a fanatical supporter base. I think it is vital that you have a hard core of good people who want the club to succeed to be able to build and plan for development in the future. 'Now that I have the next chapter of my career finalised, I am fully focused on finishing my time with Leeds as strongly as possible and leaving my home-town club in the best possible position.' Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington said: 'I think this is an inspired appointment by Hull KR and I know Jamie will be very good at what will be a very different challenge. 'He has been at the heart of all our success over the past decade and his performances and influence at the club cannot be overestimated. He will leave a lasting legacy and all our best wishes will be with him when he swaps his training kit for a new suit at the end of the season.'", "candidates": [["Former England captain Jamie Peacock has been named the new football manager of Super League club Hull KR.

He must stand still while players take aim at him and report back on the impact of the paintballs. Despite the welts and occasional pain, he loves his job and has a high pain tolerance.", "article": "Jordan Wills works as a paintball target, with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range. When student Jordan Wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets, fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph. The 19-year-old from London works as a human bullet impact tester, or more simply a paintball target, and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave. He beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the \u00a316,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies. 'I guess I have a high pain tolerance - but it's really not as painful as people think,' said the Kingston University Computer Graphics student. 'The hardest part is the anticipation when you know it's coming. 'The most times I'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two.' And while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing, Mr Wills does his job in just a t-shirt. He is a fan of the game anyway, and has previously played a lot in his spare time. He works 16 hours a week at different UK Paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of \u00a340,000, which works out at a wage of around \u00a316,000 a year. Mr Wills, who stays in shape as a rower, said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job. He added: 'When people find out what I do they think I'm crazy - but I love my job. 'The initial pain lasts for about five seconds, then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it's gone. I don't even remember I've been shot.' The teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to. The paintballs are fired at Jordan's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph. Rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs, Mr Wills must stand still while players take aim at him. He reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard.  Anything that draws blood, leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable. Mr Wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball. The 19-year-old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear. The practice leaves him with welts over his body, but the student said he barely notices. 'Sometimes I take a hot bath after a shift, but mostly I just forget they're even there,' he added. 'At first my girlfriend didn't like it, but now she's cool with it. The marks take about four days to fade. 'I think I got the job because I knew about paintballing already. I worked for three years marshalling games - so I was well aware of what it felt like to be hit. 'I love paintballing and knew about the different types of paints and the ins and outs of the guns. 'People tell me I must be an idiot but it's only people who don't know enough about paintball. When you're in the middle of a game you're running around and having so much fun you hardly notice when you're hit. The teenager does his job wearing just a t-shirt, and endures balls being fired at him at very close range. As part of the role Mr Wills must stand still and resist the urge, as happens in actual games, to run away. 'I work two days a week and my hours are flexible. 'I have great colleagues and get to work outside and have a bit of fun. What's not to like?' Justin Toohig, UK Paintball owner and the student's boss, said: 'Jordan's a great guy. He's up for a laugh, has a fantastic attitude and fits in well with the crew - that's mainly what we were looking for. 'He can take the bullets like a man and doesn't whinge at all. He's athletic and knew about paintball. 'We still can't believe how many applicants we got. Emails were coming in from all over the world - new ones were popping up faster than we could file them. 'Maybe it's a sign of the economy, or simply because people love paintball. Mr Wells insists he doesn't really feel pain from the impact of paintballs being fired at him at close range.

{"abstract": "Scott Hoyle is on trial for killing a former Royal Marine, Orlando Rogers, in a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft crash. The prosecution claims Hoyle was reckless in attempting a loop-the-loop manoeuvre at a low height, despite the passenger being too big for the move to be carried out safely. Hoyle claims he lost control of the aircraft due to a control restriction, but eye-witnesses saw the aircraft attempting a loop before the crash.", "article": "Scott Hoyle, 48, is on trial accused of killing a former Royal Marine who died when an alleged stunt in a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft went wrong. A former Royal Marine pilot killed his passenger after crashing his aircraft while performing a 'foolish and dangerous' loop-the-loop at a low height, a court has heard. Scott Hoyle, 48, allegedly carried out the acrobatic manoeuvre in his Tiger Moth plane, despite passenger Orlando Rogers being too big for the move to be carried out safely. The court heard how Hoyle, described in court as a novice, was'reckless' for attempting to perform the stunt at a height 'at which recovery was improbable'. Hoyle's 'risk-taking' allegedly caused the plane to nose-dive into a field near Witchampton, Dorset, killing Mr Rogers. The 26-year-old was a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. Hoyle, from Broadstone, Dorset, also suffered serious injuries during the crash, from which he has since recovered. He denies manslaughter and endangering the safety of an aircraft. Opening the case at Winchester Crown Court, Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution case is that the fatal crash was caused as a result of conscious risk-taking by Scott Hoyle, in that he flew the aircraft in a way which created an obvious risk of serious injury to Orlando Rogers, and Scott Hoyle either chose to disregard it or was indifferent to it. 'The prosecution submits that what he was intending to do was plainly dangerous and created an obvious risk of serious harm.' Mr Bowes told the jury of six men and six woman that, at 18st 7lbs and 6ft 2in, Mr Rogers' size placed restrictions on how the aircraft should be manoeuvred, something Hoyle should have known and made the flight unsafe. He said Hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft, making him a 'novice' in it, and that he was not trained to perform the loop-de-loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting. The jury was told the flight was the second Hoyle had flown from the Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset that day, having taken another friend up in his plane earlier. Mr Bowes said he had successfully completed several loops with the other passenger and that GPS tracking suggested he crashed near where these previous acrobatics had taken place. 'The location of the fatal manoeuvre and the improbability of Scott Hoyle's own account of the loss of control, and evidence from eye witnesses on the ground, all point to the fact that this was indeed an attempted loop,' said Mr Bowes. The plane crashed into a field near Witchampton, killing Mr Rogers. The 26-year-old was a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland and ran a maritime security company. Hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft, making him a 'novice' in it. He was not trained to perform the loop-de-loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting, the court heard. The court heard how the pair took off from the airfield at about 2.49pm, with the weather described as 'a pleasant spring day'. The fatal crash happened a short time later, at 3.08pm. Hoyle, who had a private pilot's licence, had flown 184.8 hours at the time of the crash, but only 35 hours in the Tiger Moth, making him 'inexperienced' in it. Mr Bowes described to the jury how eye-witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash. The plane, built in 1940, then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first. Mr Rogers was sat in the front seat of the plane, with Hoyle behind him. 'The prosecution say eye-witnesses saw the aircraft entering a loop,' said Mr Bowes. 'That point is absolutely disputed by the defence, who say it never happened. Thereafter the aircraft entered a spin from which it did not recover.' Eye-witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash. The plane, built in 1940, then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first, the court was told. Mr Bowes said Hoyle had 'no formal training in aerobatics.' He also told the jury the plane was flying too low to attempt a loop manoeuvre. When interviewed, Hoyle claimed he lost control of the aircraft due to 'a control restriction.' He said that following a left-hand turn, the rudder remained to the left. Hoyle told investigators who launched a probe into the flight that he pulled back on the stick in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft, which may have made it appear as though he was performing a loop. During his interview, Hoyle said he understood an aircraft needed to be at 3,000ft to 3,500ft to recover", "candidates": [["Scott Hoyle, a 48-year-old former Royal Marine, is on trial for killing his passenger, Orlando Rogers, in a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft crash.

The cricket itself is bad enough. But we're thinking of events off the field: if they were handed the keys to ECB headquarters, the Borgias and the Chuckle Brothers would probably bicker less and command more gravitas than the current lot. One of the side-effects of England's horrible performance at the World Cup was to bring forward the moment when our game would have to confront itself. While they were still in the tournament, there was always the promise of a horizon to cross, an itch to scratch, a wrong to right. No longer. The most alarming development of another improbable week was Alastair Cook's outburst in Abu Dhabi. It was no coincidence that the most heartfelt press conference of his career took place beyond the grasp of the ECB (perhaps beginning the county season in the Middle East does have something to recommend it after all). England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after their World Cup exit. England's exit at the World Cup was humiliating as they went out in Adelaide, Australia. England coach Peter Moores (left) at the end of the World Cup match between England and Bangladesh. But Cook was unhappy. More to the point, he hasn't got his head round his sacking as one-day captain. Neither fact reflects well on the English game. His cri de coeur came not long after coach Peter Moores had assured us that Cook had dealt with the disappointment of being axed only weeks before the World Cup. Thoughts returned to the days before that axing, when Moores stressed his support for Cook's leadership; once the leadership was over, Moores said it was 'the right thing to do'. Something is clearly being lost in translation. And it had better be reinterpreted fast: England are about to embark on 17 Tests in 10 months. It is a period that will define both captain and coach, assuming they emerge unscathed. Yet Cook also needs to be frank with himself. The reason he shouldn't have been sacked so soon before a World Cup was that he should have been sacked well in advance, and allowed to focus on what \u2013 until two years ago \u2013 he was good at: churning out Test runs. Instead, he has now been critical not just of the decision to sack him, but also \u2013 by implication \u2013 of Eoin Morgan's leadership. Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi. Alastair Cook trudges off the field in Abu Dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings. For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin. Team insiders believe his words came out the wrong way. But had they been uttered by Kevin Pietersen, they would have brought howls of 'insubordination'. And Pietersen, lapping up the limelight once more, has loved every minute. Ever since Colin Graves appeared to suggest there was a way back, he has taken every opportunity to stay in the headlines. This is his prerogative, and it has at least served to expose the ECB's continued mismanagement of the saga. To hear the national selector James Whitaker dead-bat questions from the BBC last week was to wonder at the task awaiting the ECB's new head of communications, Chris Haynes. Meanwhile, confusion continues over what exactly Graves said to Pietersen. Reports vary: he's offered an olive branch, no he hasn't; he's assured Cook that Pietersen won't play for England again, no he hasn't; he's told Pietersen there are no guarantees, no he\u2026 you get the picture. And all this, remember, before Graves has even replaced Giles Clarke as chairman. In some ways, Graves deserves our sympathy: he has inherited a mess which he presumably didn't envisage while he was operating under the radar as Clarke's deputy. And his statement on Pietersen \u2013 play county cricket or there really is no hope \u2013 had the virtue of treating him like a member of civilised society. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches at the most to impress England's selectors. He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes. But the latest bout of confused messages, simmering feuds and egotistical grandstanding are a reminder that English cricket should be careful when it next mocks, say, the Pakistanis or the West Indians for presiding over complete chaos. It's over a year now since Pietersen was told to pack up his troubles in his old kit bag. Yet, in the eyes of the public, the ECB are no closer to moving on. On the contrary: the crowd watching the sideshow is threatening to outnumber those who can still be bothered with the cricket. Pietersen has played the media game with his customary flair, befriending those he once disdained.

The White House is refusing to take him at his word. \"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,\" President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday. These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election. Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory. White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to say whether Netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would \"reassess\" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Administration officials have said the United States is now considering signing on to a U.N. resolution which supports a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls \"in droves\" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of \"rhetoric\" was \"contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly.\" Obama added: \"If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country.\" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month.

It is the latest controversy to hit Evans, generally reckoned to have the most natural ability in Britain after Andy Murray.

Placid: The lioness might be a honed killer, but she is gentle as anything with her young brood. Adorable: The relaxed lioness with one of her six young cubs climbing over her. Sibling rivalry? The cubs were seen play fighting together while the lioness looked on. Young: It is thought the lion cubs were only about six weeks old when they were photographed. But while most lionesses keep their cubs out of the limelight, this one seemed keen to make sure the photographers captured their best side. 'It was a beautiful and touching moment,' Ms Haution revealed. 'The whole family were extraordinarily cute. Mum was definitely showing off her new cubs. 'Normally, lionesses will hide their children away from predators. But she was so proud, carrying them out into the open in her mouth for us to see. 'You could see how happy she was when the cubs were climbing all over her. 'It just shows that even the biggest beasts can show love.' Indeed, the photos captured the youngsters clambering across the predator - who doesn't bat an eyelid. Roar: The cubs may still be tiny, but there is already a hint of the lions they will grow up to be. Friendly: But in other shots, the cubs look so sweet they could be household pets. Victory: But being the winner is still important - as this cub seems to be learning. Control: However, the cubs were left in no doubt of who was in charge when push came to shove. Ms Haution believes the cubs are around six weeks old, which presented a difficulty when trying to photograph them all. She said: 'There were about six in total, but they were running around all over the place so it was hard to capture them all. 'They are so adorable though.

{"abstract": "A major study has warned that taking daily paracetamol could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and early death. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed for those who took the drug for longer periods. Other scientists have played down the risks, saying that the risk is minimal and that paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available.", "article": "Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study has warned. Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study warns today. It found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed. Paracetamol is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin, which can cause stomach bleeds, and ibuprofen, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. But British researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug\u2019s safety. They think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called COX-2. Scientists from the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years, for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain. They also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all. Philip Conaghan, who led the research, pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early. For this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems. But the professor added: \u2018I am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we hadn\u2019t previously associated.\u2019 He said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments, such as exercise. Published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the study concluded: \u2018Given its high usage and availability, a systematic review of paracetamol\u2019s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted.\u2019 Professor Conaghan said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person\u2019s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed, for those who took the drug for longer periods. Statistically, one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks, strokes and other complications of heart disease. Other scientists played down the risks. Professor Nick Bateman, who specialises in clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u2018Based on this study the risk is minimal. Paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available, and this study should not stop people taking it. \u2018Based on these results, the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised, this is common sense for all medicines.\u2019 Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in the UK and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year. A further 200million packs are sold over the counter. Although the NHS does not keep figures, evidence from Canada suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year. A 2013 Oxford study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug, three would suffer a heart attack within a year, of which one would be fatal.", "candidates": [["A major study has warned that daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death.

Trouble in the skies:\u00a0The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load (file photo) The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. Though it's mandated that an F-35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The problem will not affect the Royal Navy's consignment of F-35Bs, however, as its aircraft are to carry different weapons. The F-35 program will reportedly cost more than \u00a32.5billion over the next decade. The F-35B is one of three variants of the F-35 program - and it's proved the most expensive and most troublesome to get off the ground. The F-35B features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings - like a helicopter. The F-35 in general - and the F-35B in particular - has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays.

The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth(pictured) and the HMS Prince of Wales. Since work began in 2007, an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete. Artists impressions of the ship's flight deck released before construction was underway. When completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program, said in an\u00a0Inside Defense\u00a0interview last week that changes are being made to the jet so it can be released on schedule. DellaVedova also said that Lockheed Martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015. 'This is not a new issue to us,' DellaVedova told Inside Defense. 'We've been working with the SDB II program office and their contractors since 2007. 'The fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support SDB II that have already been incorporated into production F-35 aircraft. 'These minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing SDB [II] developments.' Inside Defense reported that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external SDB IIs are in fact meant to go on the F-35B. An MoD spokesman said: 'The Small Diameter Bomb II is not part of the UK's planned weapon inventory for the Lightning II. The programme to integrate weapons from the UK inventory onto Lightning II is on track to deliver initial operating capability as planned in December 2018.' Bombs away:\u00a0The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, defense contractor Raytheon says. Defense contractor Raytheon is behind the SDB II bomb. The company proclaims on its website 'SDB II can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing aircrews' time in harm's way. 'The weapon's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous, larger weapons that required multiple jets. 'SDB II's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers, as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions.' The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, the company says. The SDB II weapons system is fully accommodated by both the F-35A - the Air Force version - and F-35C - the US Navy version, company executive Jeff White told Inside Defense. White told the news outlet 'I think it's just the B. When we did our fit checks on the JSF, the A and the C basically had the same bay.' 353 F-35Bs are being bought by the United States Marines Corps, Inside Defense reported.

{"abstract": "Utah has become the first state to bring back the firing squad as a method of execution, due to a crisis in the lethal injection system and a shortage of drugs used for executions. The execution chamber is a small room with two slits for the marksmen, and the inmate is bound to a chair with leather straps. Volunteers from the local police force are chosen to form a five-man firing squad, with one rifle containing a blank round so that no one knows who fired the lethal shot.", "article": "The police force that guards the desert state of Utah will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty. Five-man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging America back to a'more barbaric past'. Facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most Death Row inmates are normally executed, Utah's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its Wild West past. Pictured is the Utah firing squad execution chamber, where death row inmates are strapped into the seat in front of a wooden board to stop bullets, and beside sandbags that absorb blood splatters. The state has become the first to bring back the firing squad. Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican governor, conceded that he found the concept 'a little bit gruesome', but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution. Yet such a scenario looks increasingly likely. Thirty-two states still have the death penalty, and America's Death Rows are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections. These have allowed lawyers to halt the scheduling of supposedly painless executions on the grounds that they breach a constitutional ban on 'cruel and unusual' punishment. To make matters worse, supplies of the sedatives used are drying up. Many of the most effective drugs are made only in Europe, but the EU has told manufacturers they cannot sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections. U.S. drug manufacturers have already stopped making them, worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of Americans come out against the death penalty. The result? In 2014, 35 people were executed in the U.S. \u2014 the fewest since 1994. Last July, appalled witnesses described how convicted Arizona double murderer Joseph Wood lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart. Now, with Utah's dramatic announcement, opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even Wood's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair. Witnesses described how double murderer Joseph Wood (pictured) lay gulping and gasping for two hours when a cocktail of drugs failed to sedate him. Although a firing squad may sound like a long-gone relic of frontier justice, the largely Mormon state of Utah did use one five years ago. In 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner, a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt, threatened to sue Utah if it didn't allow him to be shot. The state had stopped offering Death Row inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 \u2014 but because Gardner had been convicted before the law was changed, he was still able to choose it. Gardner, who had been on Death Row for 19 years, said: 'I guess it's my Mormon heritage. It's so much easier... and there's no mistakes.' Even though history has shown the killer's statement is not true, Utah's executioners will attempt to carry out the gruesome ritual with clinical precision. Attached to the state prison at Draper, the small execution room \u2014 built in an old canning factory \u2014 is flooded with fluorescent light from the ceiling and has no decorations on its white cinderblock walls. There are two slits for the marksmen cut into a wall, through which they aim their rifles. Observation windows \u2014 protected by bulletproof glass \u2014 line the side walls of the square chamber. Screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters' wall, a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets. Behind the chair is thick wooden panelling to stop the bullets. The entire structure is painted black. The inmate is bound to the chair with leather straps around the wrists, ankles, shoulders, waist and forehead \u2014 his immobility is crucial if the shooters are to hit his heart. Locating the heart with a stethoscope, a doctor fastens a piece of white cloth two inches square, with a circle in the middle, over the left breast of the prisoner's jumpsuit. Unseen by the condemned, or the victim's relatives and media representatives witnessing the execution on either flank, the squad of marksmen file in to take up position behind the wall facing their target. Ronnie Lee Gardner appears before a judge where the date for his execution by firing squad was set for June 2010. Gardner was a convicted murderer and said death by firing squad was'so much easier... and there's no mistakes' The officers are chosen from a pool of volunteers, with priority going to those from the local force where the inmate's crimes were committed. There are always more volunteers than places on the squad. Each officer is given an identical.30 calibre Winchester rifle, loaded with a single round.

A petition has been presented to Parliament to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads.", "article": "A spate of motor accidents involving tourists have prompted concerned New Zealand motorists to confiscate the keys of foreigners to prevent them from driving. Following the death of eight people  in crashes involving tourists in the past fortnight, five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area  which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy films. New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key said that 'people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible'. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident. Foreign drivers are involved in 37% of road crashes in the Westland District, on the South Island's West Coast, despite only 6% of crashes overall in the country involving tourists. 558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver, reported The Mercury. New Zealand Police's Assistant Commissioner of Road Policing, Dave Cliff, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0that the incidents of key confiscation were hard to police as there was no specific law relating to the issue. He reiterated that violence, even to prevent a tourist driving 'dangerously' would not be tolerated, 'and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences'. Assistant Commissioner Cliff's comments follow the assault of a tourist driving on the West Coast by a man who was unhappy with his driving. The tourist was punched in the face and had his keys taken from him, with local police labelling the incident unnecessary and 'nasty', reported The New Zealand Herald. 'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' said Mr Penman. 30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads. A family of four from Hong Kong collided with a logging truck, killing all in the vehicle. West Coast's Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn, said while there was definitely an issue in the area, he was worried that 'extremist behaviour' from local drivers were becoming more common. He labelled the violence 'disgraceful' and 'inappropriate', and called for greater driver education. The Assistant Commissioner assured the New Zealand public at the time that police were not complacent about driver safety, but urged people to contact police if they were concerned, rather than resorting to the confiscation of keys. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident. 'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' he told The New Zealand Herald. 'I've been in a head-on crash before and I don't want to be in another one...Everywhere I have been people say 'good on you' for standing up,' Mr Penman said. 30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads. However,  a Queenstown judge ruled on Monday that it was not the responsibility of rental car companies to assess the competency of drivers, and rather up to the individual driver to determine their own abilities. Earlier in the month a 39-year-old Taiwanese female teacher was charged with careless driving causing death and careless driving causing injury. 558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver. Five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's (above left) The Lord of the Rings trilogy films. She was driving to the airport in a rented van with six family members when she drove through a stop sign, causing the death of her father and seriously injuring her mother. Paul Whitmell, 57, and his wife Rosa, 54, were driving from Mt Cook to Te Anau, when they were involved in a head-on collision with Chinese driver Qian Li, 34, on Gibbston Highway on February 21. The British couple suffered serious injuries, and Li's passenger  Mingyue Shen was also injured, for which the judge sentenced Li on three charges of careless driving causing injury.

{"abstract": "Andrew Cuomo's new biography, The Contender, paints a different picture of his divorce from Kerry Kennedy than his own autobiography. The book alleges that the couple started talking about divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter, and that Cuomo dragged out the break-up for years. It also claims that Cuomo had disdain for the Kennedy family and that the couple had disagreements over small things like furniture covers and cooking.", "article": "In his autobiography published late last year, Andrew Cuomo described himself as the victim in his bitter divorce from Kerry Kennedy - saying he learned about the break-up from a reporter who called him for comment. But a new biography of the New York governor says he had a larger part in the unraveling of the marriage, which briefly united two political dynasties. Vanity Fair's Michael Shnayerson alleges in 'The Contender' that the couple started talking 'not if but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. However, Cuomo dragged out the break-up for years - possibly to use his wife's political clout to fuel his failed 2002 gubernatorial run, the book alleges. Doomed: A new biography of  Andrew Cuomo details the bitter divorce between the current New York Governor and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F Kennedy. The former couple pictured above on their wedding day in 1990. The New York Daily News, which previewed the book, cited Shnayerson's sources who said the couple learned they were incompatible fairly early on in their relationship. Shnayerson did not interview Cuomo himself. Shnayerson quotes a Douglas Kennedy - Kerry's 46-year-old younger brother - \u00a0who says that while Cuomo treasured the connection to the Kennedy family, he loathed participating in reunions at the family's estate in Hyannis, Massachusetts and eventually stopped going altogether. Douglas Kennedy said on one occasion, when the Kennedys spent a night partying and singing, Cuomo stood by 'looking disgusted'.\u00a0Douglas also described Cuomo as a 'bully' who thought many member's of his wife's family as weak or 'political'. Not if, but when: Author Michael Shnayerson says in 'The Contender' that Cuomo and Kennedy started talking not if 'but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. The couple pictured above with twins Cara Ethel and Mariah Matila, with father Andrew holding baby Michaela. Staying together for the campaign: Kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor. According to the book, the couple agreed to break-up after the campaign, but Cuomo kept putting it off. The Contender, written by Vanity Fair writer Michael Shnayerson, is due out March 31. Perhaps one of the most painful digs at the Kennedy family was the Manhattan party that acted as the informal launch for Cuomo's 2002 campaign for governor. At the party, the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil' was played at high-volume - a song which deals with the assassinations of both President John F Kennedy and Kerry father's Robert F Kennedy. The Kennedy's who were in the room for the party were aghast, but it's unclear if Cuomo was behind the decision to play the song. Disdain for the in-laws wasn't the only issue between the political couple. Kerry Kennedy and Cuomo harbored ill-feelings about the little things too, the book claims. When she first started dating Cuomo, Kennedy allegedly 'rolled her eyes a bit' when she saw the plastic covers he kept on his furniture. And a friend close to one side of the former couple told Shnayerson that Cuomo wasn't dazzled by his wife's cooking, cleaning or even the 'dowdy' way she dressed. By the time Cuomo started planning his 2002 run for governor, his wife agreed to stay with him through the campaign. But when the campaign failed, Cuomo allegedly asked her to stay together for just a little longer. The breaking point for Kennedy, according to Shnayerson, came when Cuomo confronted her for having an extra-marital affair with polo player Bruce Colley. A 'closer observer' told Shnayerson that Kennedy told Cuomo to mind his own business, break the news to the kids and move out of their home. 'After 13 years of marriage, and truly stressful times, I knew the ties that bound us together had frayed,' Cuomo wrote in his autobiography All Things Possible, published late last year. 'But I had hoped we could work through what I saw was a difficult time, not an end. Obviously, I was in denial.' 'Even though Kerry had told me she wanted a divorce I thought I could fix it, I couldn\u2019t accept it \u2014 it only became real when a reporter called and said she filed the papers.' Breaking point: The couple officially divorced in 2005. Cuomo eventually won the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee.

{"abstract": "Ellen Pao is suing a Silicon Valley venture capital firm for gender bias and is testifying that she did not reject the initial romantic advances of a male colleague. Pao claims that she was denied a promotion and then fired after she complained, and is seeking $16 million in damages. She believes that her lawsuit will create equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector.", "article": "A woman suing a prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm in a high-profile case alleging gender bias testified on Tuesday that she did not reject the initial romantic advances of a male colleague and even discussed having children with him. Plaintiff Ellen Pao told jurors the colleague, Ajit Nazre, first approached her romantically during a trip to Germany after she had been struck by a cab. She was dazed from her injuries and couldn't object to his advances, she said. In court on Tuesday: Ellen Pao(left) leaves the courthouse during a lunch break from her trial in which she claimed her former colleague Ajit Nazre (right) made sexual advances after she was in a car accident. 'I got hit by a cab and then he tried to hit on me,' Pao said. Under further questioning by Lynne Hermle, an attorney for defendant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Pao said she and the co-worker eventually had an affair and she told him she loved him. Pao claims in her lawsuit that she was denied a promotion at the firm because of gender bias and then fired after she complained. Her lawsuit has spotlighted gender imbalance at elite Silicon Valley investment companies that are stacked with some of the nation's most accomplished graduates - multiple degree holders from schools such as Stanford and Harvard who are competing aggressively to back the next Google or Amazon. Women, however, are grossly underrepresented in the venture capital and technology sectors. Pao addressed that issue under questioning by her attorney, saying her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector. 'I've tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path,' she told jurors. 'I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists.' Improper treatment: Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao is suing her former employer, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, for $16 million alleging she was sexually harassed by male officials. Pao was questioned for the first time by Hermle. Their exchanges were often tense, with Pao staring at the lawyer and pausing before responding yes or no. Hermle also showed emails to the jury in which Pao and the co-worker exchanged compliments and banter. In one email from 2006, after the affair began, Pao wrote that she was always looking out for Nazre- 'never stopped, never will.' In text messages that year, she said she didn't think he was a bad person and she wasn't mad at him for not being able to have a real relationship at the time. Pao previously testified that she began the affair after the colleague said his wife had left him. She said she broke it off several months later when she learned that was a lie. Gender equality: Ellen Pao, pictured on Tuesday, said her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector. After she ended the affair, Pao testified, the colleague retaliated by shutting her out of emails and meetings. When she raised the retaliation issue with management, a senior partner explained how he had met his wife at another company while he was married, and perhaps Pao could have the same outcome with her colleague, she testified. The firm did nothing about the retaliation, she said. When it came to Pao's application to work at Kleiner Perkins, Hermle talked about the job requirements.

Murray is marrying long-term partner Sears in his hometown Dunblane on April 11. 'If I don't do well I'm going to stay here anyway and train on the clay and get used to playing in hot conditions. Regardless of how I do I'll be here for the next ten days.' With his 28th birthday looming time is short and Murray's first few weeks as a married man will involve getting stuck into the clay with little luxuriating in his new status. He will play in Munich, Madrid and Rome before the French Open, and might even take his new bride straight to the Riviera. 'Depending on how I feel after the wedding there's potential to play Monte Carlo, but I'd say that's unlikely. The honeymoon won't be until the end of the year.' It was this time last year that he split from Ivan Lendl in a tumultuous week when he cut a distraught figure, and he now feels far more settled with the Czech's replacement Amelie Mauresmo. 'My mind is a lot clearer and I think that's shown,' he said. 'Last year I came here and had struggled for the first three months and physically I was still not feeling great after surgery. I hadn't seen Ivan much, probably for only three to four weeks since my surgery (in late September) and there wasn't much direction. That carried on for a bit after I finished here. 'I was disappointed with how I played against Novak on Saturday but otherwise I felt I played well at Indian Wells. I hadn't played well there for about five years and this was by far the best in that time.' British No 1 Murray crashed out of the BNP Paribas semi-final at Indian Wells after losing to Novak Djokovic. Murray will be hoping to go one step further in Miami, a tournament he has won twice before in 2009 and 2013. Murray's caoch Amelie Mauresmo watches on from the stands in Indian Wells. A look at the 'Race for London' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for Murray, with him ahead of Tomas Berdych, Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, in that order. The perception that he has stuttered might have been inflated by the loss to the imperious Djokovic.

'I did modelling campaigns growing up but my mum made me wait until I was 17 to sign with an agency and I didn't move to New York and start working full-time until I was 18.

But the fact that her face is her pay packet hasn't made her precious over her appearance. She has a low maintenance beauty regime and regularly indulges in her favourite fast food - burgers. She told the magazine: 'I definitely strive to be a low-maintenance model. Some girls have their hair and make-up artist arrive five hours before an event, but I aim to do it in two hours max - I'm not trying to wake up at 7am for a 7pm event.' The blessing of having the metabolism of a teenager means that she usually doesn't even bother to step up her exercise regime ahead of a fashion photo shoot. Gigi at the Oscars Vanity Fair After Party in LA last month. She said: 'If I did I would never get to have a burger or take a day off from the gym for a movie marathon, which would not be cool. I do step up my regime before a Sports Illustrated shoot or if I'm shooting lingerie. And a couple of weeks\u00a0before a fashion show, I'll eat more healthily and make sure I'm in the gym at least once a day boxing.' Despite recently being announced as the face of Maybelline, Gigi doesn't even have much of a beauty regime. When asked about her top skincare tip, she told the publication: 'I love St Ives Invigorating Apricot Facial Scrub; it's the best.

Above, Ford is pictured\u00a0being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher last Thursday. Wrecked: The document, issued by the NTSB, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport last Thursday. Above, Ford's wrecked plane after the crash. Document: Ford then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report (pictured) states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground. Meanwhile, Ford, who played Han Solo in the original Star Wars series, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. However, he is expected to make a full recovery. The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash. This meant he did not need to submit a flight plan. It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport'. Ford 'initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course,' the report states. It concludes: 'The airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.' The report was constructed 'using data from various sources' after 'a significant amount of investigative work'. It does not detail why Ford's engine might have failed, causing him to plummet to the ground. A final report is expected to be released when NTSB officials have finished their inquiry into the crash. Devoted: Ford suffered serious injuries in the crash, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. Above, his wife, Calista Flockhart, is seen on Tuesday driving home from hospital after spending the entire day with him. Recovery: Ford is being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (pictured) in Los Angeles, California. Last week, dramatic pictures emerged showing Ford being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher, his face covered in blood and his neck strapped into a brace. First responders were also pictured wrapping bandages around his head.\u00a0'He was stunned a bit,' spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana, who was playing golf at the course at the time, told ABC News. He added: 'He was moaning and in pain. It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious.' A video also emerged showing horrified golfers gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way as Ford deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground.

{"abstract": "Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed suddenly during a game between Swansea and Tottenham at White Hart Lane. He was treated for five minutes before being stretchered off and taken to the medical room. Gomis suffers from a medical condition called vasovagal, which can cause a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and the incident brought back memories of Fabrice Muamba's near-fatal cardiac arrest in 2012.", "article": "Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed suddenly at White Hart Lane in scenes reminiscent of Fabrice Muamba\u2019s near-fatal cardiac arrest in March 2012. With no one near him, the Swansea star appeared to lose consciousness in the centre circle, slumping to the floor, moments after Nacer Chadli had given Tottenham a 1-0 lead. Both sets of medical staff came rushing onto the pitch to care for the stricken Frenchman as the two groups of players looked on in despair. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham. Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness. Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff. Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane. Gomis was treated for five minutes before being stretchered off holding an oxygen mask to his mouth, although he appeared to be conscious as he left the field. The striker, who suffers from vasovagal \u2014 a medical condition that can lead to fainting \u2014 was taken straight to the White Hart Lane medical room where he was given more treatment. However, good news emerged from Swansea at half-time that Gomis was fine and had not been hospitalised. \u2018He is fine,\u2019 said a Swansea spokesperson. \u2018He is in the medical room.It is something we have been aware of \u2014 it is something called a vasovagal condition. We have always been aware of it and it has happened before. He has had all the medical and cardiology tests with us.\u2019 The condition occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as physical or emotional distress. This can then cause a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, which reduces the blood flow to the brain. A brief loss of consciousness can follow. The French striker later tweeted in French and then English, saying: 'I Wanted to reassure you concerning my Health, it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now. 'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France. 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order. 'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get Well messages.' Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher. Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game. In the early moments of the second half, Swansea also confirmed on their official Twitter account that Gomis had improved. The striker has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times in the space of three months after joining Lyon in 2009. One of those episodes occurred while training with the France national squad in October 2009. After reportedly losing consciousness for six minutes, he re-joined the session 15 minutes later. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said at the time: \u2018We can\u2019t not be worried, it scares you each time. A vasovagal episode (fainting) is part of the things that can happen to people who have this type of constitution. It\u2019s now three times that it\u2019s happened. Yes, I\u2019m worried.\u2019 A stunned silence came over White Hart Lane as the incident unfolded last night, no doubt re-kindling memories of Muamba\u2019s cardiac arrest which occurred nearly three years ago to the day and almost on the same spot on the White Hart Lane pitc. On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham. The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist\u00a0Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch. Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned. Medical staff rush to Fabrice Muamba's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012. Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance. Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football. Former players immediately took to Twitter to express their shock and wish Gomis a speedy recovery.

{"abstract": "Leading public health researchers have called for a 'turbocharged' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040. They claim one billion deaths from smoking could be averted by the end of the century, if action is taken now. The authors note this can be achieved by accelerating the FCTC in those countries slow on the uptake, and by greater regulation and closer scrutiny of the tobacco industry.", "article": "Experts have called for a 'turbocharged' campaign to rid the world of tobacco by 2040. Leading experts have called for a 'turbocharged' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040. The sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years, leading public health researchers have today said. They claim one billion deaths from smoking could be averted by the end of the century, if action is taken now. But a  global campaign will only work with the support of governments as well as with stronger evidence-based action against the tobacco industry, they warn. Professors Robert Beaglehole and Ruth Bonita, from the University of Auckland in New Zealand have called on the United Nations to lead efforts against the sale and consumption of tobacco. They warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world, tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade, notably in Africa and the Middle East. With global population rising, there could still be more than a billion people smoking in 2025 unless urgent action is taken, it is claimed. The call to arms in the fight against smoking comes in a series of articles published in the Lancet medical journal and will be launched at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Professor  Beaglehole,  said: 'The time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products. 'A world where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now, but only with full commitment from governments, international agencies, such as UN and WHO (World Health Organisation), and civil society.' Global tobacco regulation should be 'turbocharged', with the United Nations taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco. The experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the 'big four' tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle-income countries. Their alleged tactics included industrial litigation, lobbying through third-party groups, and covert maintenance of political pressure disguised as 'corporate social responsibility'. Professor Anna Gilmore, another of the authors from the University of Bath, said: 'Contrary to industry claims, tobacco marketing deliberately targets women and young people. 'The tobacco industry continues to interfere with governments' efforts to implement effective tobacco control policies. 'If the world is to become tobacco free, it's vital that the industry's appalling conduct receives far closer scrutiny and countries which stand up to the industry's bullying tactics receive better global support.' A decade on from the WHO's landmark introduction of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), just 15 per cent of the world's population have adequate access to smoking cessation services. Moreover, less than one in 10 people across the world are covered by tobacco taxation at levels recommended by the FCTC. The experts led by Professors Robert Beaglehole and Ruth Bonita, from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, said the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years. That is despite research showing that increasing the cost of tobacco to consumers through taxation is one of the most effective ways to reduce consumption. In the last 10 years 50 million people have died as a result of tobacco use, indicating the FCTC alone is insufficient to achieve substantive reductions in the use of tobacco. While the implementation of the FCTC has been successful in some countries, particularly in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, the UK and some Pacific island countries, global action must now be taken. The authors note this can be achieved by accelerating the FCTC in those countries slow on the uptake. They said up until now too much focus has been on reducing the demand for tobacco. For further progress to be made, however, attention must turn to the supply, with greater regulation and closer scrutiny of the tobacco industry. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said: 'Along with many other rich nations, we have made good progress in reducing tobacco use over the past several decades. 'However, one in five UK adults continue to smoke, not through choice but because they are addicted. 'And 100,000 die early each year as a result. 'The authors of the Lancet articles are right that we need to do more to tackle the tobacco industry and to make it pay for the damage it does. 'This is just what the tobacco levy currently being consulted on by HM Treasury could achieve. 'But it is essential that the money raised should be used to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up this deadly habit.'", "candidates": [["Leading experts have called for a 'turbocharged' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040, with the sale of tobacco phased out within the next 25 years.

{"abstract": "Celtic manager Ronny Deila has urged his players to embrace history as they face Dundee United in three consecutive games that could determine if they win the Treble. Deila is confident his team will bounce back from their midweek loss to St Johnstone, but has injury concerns with Adam Matthews, Kris Commons, John Guidetti, Emilio Izaguirre, Mikael Lustig, and Charlie Mulgew. The game against Dundee United will be a tough challenge, but Deila believes his team can rise to the occasion and make history.", "article": "Ronny Deila has urged his Celtic players to embrace history - rather than fear it - when their aspirations of landing the Treble are put on the line in three showdowns with Dundee United. Celtic travel to Tannadice on Saturday in the Scottish Cup quarter-final - before a Hampden clash with Jackie McNamara's men in the League Cup final seven days later is followed by a Premiership meeting with the Tangerines the following weekend. Those three games will go a long way to determining if this Celtic team have the mettle to become just the fourth in the club's history to complete a clean sweep of domestic honours. Ronny Deila has urged his Celtic players to embrace history, rather than fear it, against Dundee United. Deila says his squad are fully aware that only Jock Stein's sides of 1967 and 1969 together with Martin O'Neill's class of 2001 had previously won the league, Scottish Cup and League Cup. But the Norwegian believes they should be inspired by the prospect of matching such heady feats rather than be daunted by it. 'Everyone is aware of that,' Deila said. 'That's a positive thing - and we really want it. But we have to do it on the pitch. Celtic's Efe Ambrose leaves the field dejected as St Johnstone celebrate their midweek win at Celtic Park. 'There is nothing to fear. These are positive things. We are not talking relegation. That's a hard pressure. We have everything to win and we are really looking forward to it. 'Dundee United have done a very good job this year. They have been a good team and are going to be a tough opponent. We have to be up for the game. 'The three games between them \u2013 they are going to be really tough. But to win the championship and trophies is going to be hard. Everybody knows that. The cup is one game so we have to do everything we possibly can before the game to be ready for it.' Celtic blew a chance to extend their lead over Aberdeen to nine points on Wednesday by losing 1-0 at home to St Johnstone. St Johnstone's Steven MacLean holds off Celtic's Jason Denayer during the game at Celtic Park in midweek. Yet, Deila was reluctant to be overly critical of his players, given the game was their eighth in 26 days. 'It is not the second and the third and the fourth game that is hard when you play so many games,' he insisted. 'It is when you come to the sixth and seventh after each other and also only having three days instead of four between games. 'It is a big difference because you can't get 100 per cent rested. You lose 10 per cent against Inter Milan and then go into the game against Aberdeen and lose another 10 per cent again because you can't rest. St Johnstone's Murray Davisdon clears the ball from Celtic's Virgil van Dijk during the midweek clash. 'You saw against St Johnstone that the first 25 minutes was good, we were controlling the game, playing quick and getting chances but suddenly it was like a click and the energy was out of the boys.' However, Deila fully expects his players to be back to their best by the time they arrive on Tayside. 'This is four days (rest) and that is an important thing. It is an extra day and also it is not 12pm but 3.30pm so I am glad we play on Sunday and we are going to bounce back on Sunday \u2013 I am confident of that.' As well as the absences of cup-tied pair Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, Deila has a number of injury concerns. Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong will miss the game against Dundee United as they are cup tied. 'Adam (Matthews) got a twisted ankle so hopefully he will be okay,' he explained. 'With Kris (Commons) and John (Guidetti) we will have to see but there are possibilities for both of them. 'With Emilio (Izaguirre) we have to think about what we will do. He is a possibility but we will be taking a risk with him. It is too early for (Mikael) Lustig or (Charlie) Mulgew.' Pressed on the prognosis for Izaguirre's broken finger, Deila said: 'Emilio doesn't need an operation but it might be a bit of a risk to play him.'

Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River. She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelg\u00e4nger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband. 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back. She added: \u2018You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' A shocked Irvine retorted: \u2018Don\u2019t you copy Cleopatra?\u2019 In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original. Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing. Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired. You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland. She told The New Zealand Herald: \u2018He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way. \u2018He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d He then snarled, \u201cThat was so rude\u201d as we both went into the bakery.\u2019 She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed \u2018you are such a c***\u2019. The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult. But Moon told the newspaper: \u2018I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.\u2019 In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer\u2019s letter, writing \u2018not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that \"statement\" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?\u2019 Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing. She wrote: \u2018Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!\u2019 X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair\u2019s behalf. Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates. He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' Kills continued: 'It's absolutely disgusting... you make me sick.

An official report revealed that the crash was caused by the pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery. Tests carried out on the helicopter following the crash found no abnormalities in the cockpit controls, engine or other parts of the aircraft.", "article": "Harrison Ford's flying ability was called into question in an official report following his first aviation crash, Daily Mail Online can reveal. The Hollywood star, who was rushed to hospital after crashing a vintage plane in Venice, California on Thursday, also slammed a helicopter into a riverbed back in 1999. It is not believed that Ford, 72, is to blame for his latest - and what is his third - aviation incident at Penmar Golf Course near Santa Monica Municipal Airport, with early reports suggesting engine failure is at fault. But an official report into Ford's October 1999 accident, obtained by Daily Mail Online, reveals it was caused by 'the pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery'. Ford had flown the helicopter from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles 45 miles northwest towards Santa Clarita when he hit trouble. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Full recovery: Ford was rushed from the scene bleeding heavily from a head wound, his injuries were described only as'moderate' and he is expected to recover fully. Pictured, an aerial view of the crash. Rescue: Harrison Ford is treated at the scene of his crash in Venice, California, yesterday. The pilot was practicing autorotations to a power-on recovery. When he attempted to recover the power, the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter landed hard, hitting on the rear heels of both skids. The flight instructor said that when he saw the pilot was late adding power, he attempted to correct the situation but was unsuccessful. The surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand. The left skid heel contacted a log that was embedded in the sand and the helicopter pitched forward onto the skid toes and rolled over onto its left side. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows:. The pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery from an autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing and rollover. The flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight was also causal. Source: NTSB. Ford was practicing 'auto rotations' - an emergency landing technique that simulates engine failure. He had completed one 'auto-rotation' but on his second he was 'late bringing in the power', according to the documents. As a result, when Ford attempted to recover, the helicopter engine did not respond quickly enough and the aircraft began plummeting to the ground. The unidentified flying instructor who was aboard with the actor was forced to take over the controls and try to level the helicopter but he was unable to do so and the aircraft came crashing down into the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita and flipped over. Luckily Ford, and the unnamed instructor, were unharmed in the crash but the helicopter was'substantially damaged', according to the document. Coincidentally the helicopter was registered to MG Aviation \u2013 the same firm to which the 1942 vintage plane involved in Ford's latest crash is registered to. The official report, which does not name Ford or his instructor, states: 'On October 23, 1999, at 1115 hours Pacific daylight time, a Bell 206-L4, N36R, landed hard and rolled over in the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California. 'The helicopter, operated by MG Aviation, Teterboro, New Jersey, under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, was substantially damaged.' The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) document goes on to say that the pilot reported that he'successfully completed one practice autorotation and entered a second approximately 600 feet agl.' It adds: 'When he attempted to recover power, the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter settled hard into the soft creek bed.' The certified flying instructor (CFI) flying with the Star Wars legend, reported that, 'the pilot had been late bringing in the power and he had gotten on the controls during the flare to help the pilot and level the helicopter. 'The pilot reported that when he realized there was a lack of power, he tried to push the nose over. 'Both the pilot and CFI applied full collective, and reported that there was not sufficient rotor rpm to effectively cushion the landing, causing the helicopter to land on the heels of both skids. 'The surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand; the aft end of the left skid contacted a 12-inch-diameter log that was embedded within the riverbed. Experienced: Harrison Ford at the controls of his helicopter in February last year. 'The tip of the left skid nosed into the sand and the helicopter rolled over onto its left side.' Tests carried out on the helicopter following the crash found 'no abnormalities' in the cockpit controls, engine or other parts of the aircraft.

{"abstract": "England will face Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday, with the Calcutta Cup at stake. Scotland have not won at Twickenham since 1983, and England will be looking to bounce back from their defeat to Ireland. If England lose, it could have a major impact on their World Cup preparations, as they look to create a fortress-feel at Twickenham.", "article": "After the Lord Mayor\u2019s Show on Saturday afternoon in Cardiff \u2014 where their title hopes will be crushed or resurrected \u2014 England will set about further diminishing the value of the old Calcutta Cup at Twickenham. Stuart Lancaster\u2019s team cannot lose. The notion of defeat is unthinkable, in an increasingly downgraded fixture. Last year, the Red Rose raiders left Murrayfield with a 20-0 victory and the scoreline fairly reflected the poverty of the Scottish display. If anything, it flattered them. England go through the motions in training as Courtney Lawes offloads the ball at Twickenham. Tom Wood passes the ball as England ran through their moves for the final time before the Scotland clash. England will be wounded after their defeat to Ireland, and are sure to bounce back by beating Scotland. Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup aloft after winning it at Murrayfield last year. Stuart Lancaster's men need a win against Scotland, and should get it against the wooden spoon candidates. Since then, Vern Cotter has brought Kiwi steel and some encouraging results, but Saturday's visitors are bottom of the RBS 6 Nations table after three straight defeats \u2014 the last at home to Italy \u2014 and they have not won in south west London for two generations. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister the last time Scotland left Twickenham as conquerors, in 1983. Since then, they have endured 32 years of failure at the home of their \u2018Auld Enemy\u2019 and this does not appear to be the occasion when that dire run is destined to come to an end. Andy Farrell summed up England\u2019s mood on Friday, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll be disappointed if we don\u2019t get the performance this week \u2014 and with that hopefully we could be able to keep the record going.\u2019 So, at the end of a week which began with Stuart Hogg bemoaning a lack of English \u2018respect\u2019 for Scottish rugby, the Lions full-back and his team-mates have a prime opportunity to regain it, by claiming a win which would amount to one of the upsets of the era. They will be desperate to salvage a crumbling campaign but England are also in wounded mode after their beating in Dublin, which derailed the Grand Slam bandwagon for the umpteenth year. Given the vast gulf in playing resources between the two nations, England would have the clout to prevail with three or four entirely different line-ups. James Haskell goes for a run with the ball as England prepared for the must-win fixture at Twickenham. George Ford works on his kicking as Danny Cipriani watches on during the final training session. Ben Youngs throws as pass as England's forwards look on, ahead of a game they should win easily. England could beat Scotland with three of four different XVs, and will have more than enough on Saturday. Scotland go through their paces at Twickenham on Friday - it's an important game for them to restore pride. That is not to denigrate the Scots; it is just a reflection of stark reality. Cotter\u2019s side have dropped to 10th in the World Rugby rankings, six places behind England who have shifted clear of fifth-placed Australia. Another defeat for Scotland would leave them in danger of being over-taken by Japan, while losing further ground on Samoa above them. So if Lancaster and his squad have any pretensions of mounting a meaningful World Cup challenge, this is a fixture with no safety net. They cannot lose, because to do so would shatter all hope of going into the tournament with their stadium regarded as a place where visiting teams fear to tread. Defeat would wreck the quest to create that fortress-feel at Twickenham and would also ensure that England could not rely on telling momentum to propel them into the showpiece event in September and October. It is quite feasible these nations will meet again in a World Cup quarter-final at the same venue on October 18. The thought of losing that one would be enough to give Lancaster sleepless nights for the next seven months. The last time Scotland beat England at Twickenham in 1983, Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister. John Beattie celebrates a Scotland try, but the Calcutta Cup has been devalued by England's dominance since. Fortunately for the head coach, he has a squad who are driven by a fervent desire to make amends for their loss to Ireland, and more than enough trump cards to ensure this is an occasion devoid of tension and a nasty shock at the end. What is crucially absent from the English armoury is an ability to shape their own championship destiny. In the hours before kick-off, they must decide whether to stay true to their pre-match plan involving a black-out of all news from Cardiff, where Wales can do them an almighty favour by ending Ireland\u2019s Slam crusade at the penultimate stage.

Rebekah Gregory and her son Noah were also injured in the bombing, and she remembers hearing her son calling for her amidst the chaos. The trial of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has begun, with witnesses recounting the pain and destruction of the attack.", "article": "Boston (CNN)She knew something awful had happened. It was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams. Her foot was turned sideways and her legs wouldn't work right. And her good friend, Krystle Campbell, was just lying there on the ground. Karen Rand -- she's Karen McWatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement. She wanted to get closer to Krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos. \"I got close to her, \" she recalled. \"For some reason, I got close to her head and we put our faces together.\" Krystle said that her legs hurt. They were the last words she'd speak. The two women held hands until Krystle's went limp. McWatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the United States for policies they believe inflict suffering on Muslims. Three people were killed in the blasts: Campbell, a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain; Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy; and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old grad student. More than 250 others were injured. And the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack, who recounted in detail the chaos of that day. Prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted. Tsarnaev's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors. McWatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people. Their two faces, side by side, stand out among the jumble of limbs. Krystle's mouth is open, but she is very pale. \"I was really scared,\" McWatters testified, \"and I remember screaming for someone to help us. Everybody was screaming, everybody was screaming for help. It seemed like a long time before help got to us, but it probably wasn't.\" By the time first responders reached Krystle, it was too late.  \"They were doing CPR on Krystle and I started to think she didn't make it,\" McWatters said. She grabbed her friend's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket. By the time she arrived at the hospital, shock had set in. She was confused. For a while, that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was Krystle Campbell. When Krystle's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she wasn't their daughter, they were heartbroken, McWatters said. Krystle's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents. Two days later, doctors told her they were taking her leg. Her body was broken, and it hurt like crazy, she said. But not as much as losing her friend. Campbell's death was the first to be described in detail at Tsarnaev's trial. But descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will come soon. There were runners conquering a 26.2-mile feat nearby, but Noah's attention was elsewhere, playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist. The 5-year-old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks, his mother, Rebekah Gregory, told jurors. Gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that Noah was happy playing scientist. The next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back. Other witnesses used similar phrases: Blown through the air, deafening explosion, cries for help. Shane O'Hara, the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store near where the bombs went off, said it sounded like a loud cannon, followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows. O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair. The decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him, he said. There were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors' questions. He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the courtroom. He told the jury the plea he heard: \"Stay with me, stay with me.\" Outside, Gregory tried to sit up, but could not rise much. \"My first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby, where was my son,\" Gregory said. She couldn't see her legs, but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk, she testified. \"At that point I thought that was the day I would die,\" she said. Gregory lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh. Somehow, over the cacophony, she heard Noah calling for her. She wasn't imagining it.

In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. But Ed Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Scroll down for video. Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa, (middle row)  and LK Bennett, (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland. David Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.' Mr Umunna went further dismissed it as a 'letter organised by the Conservative Party in a Conservative-supporting newspaper' after it was first published in the Daily Telegraph. But Mr Cameron, touring Marston's brewery in the Wolverhampton today, said the letter from business leaders was'very powerful'. David Cameron and George Osborne visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton today on the second full day of the general election campaign. Mr Cameron said the letter from business leaders was'very powerful' while the Chancellor claimed it was 'unprecedented' Tory officials said the number of signatories to the open letter (above) made it 'unprecedented' in the history of British general elections. He said: 'Today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best-known business, large and small, in our country saying the Conservative long-term plan is working, generating jobs. 'That is a very clear message from business leaders who, like me, care about jobs and wealth creation and prosperity and livelihoods in our country.' Chancellor George Osborne added: 'The warning from Britain's business leaders couldn't be clearer: a change of course will threaten jobs, deter investment, send a negative signal about our country and put the recovery at risk.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the letter was a tribute to the work of the Coalition government, and claimed an outright Tory win would \u2018pose a very real threat\u2019 to Britain\u2019s stability. The Lib Dem leader said yesterday: \u2018I read the letter carefully, it talks about what this coalition government has done, and I think the signatories to the letter are completely right in saying that about the last thing that this country needs, now that we\u2019re emerging from this long shadow of the economic crash in 2008, is a great lurch in one direction or another.' However, the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the signatories were 'not exactly representative' of the business community and should 'be careful what they wish for', accusing some of signing up 'naively' to a Tory stunt. The business leaders were particularly positive about Mr Osborne's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax, which fell to 20 per cent this week, having stood at 28 per cent when the Government came to power in 2010. 'David Cameron and George Osborne's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the UK is open for business. It has been a key part of their economic plan,' the business leaders said in the letter. 'The result is that Britain grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85million new jobs.'

PR stunt:\u00a0The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was part of an advertising campaign. Rainforest: One of the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line has been made to look like a rainforest with green designs on the floor, walls and ceiling. Psychedelic: Each of the carriages contained different images, ranging from traditional blossom trees to more psychedelic designs. Tao Chin, a spokesman for the underground line, said: 'We wanted to make the experience of travelling on carriages more enjoyable, and so the 3D effect covering various subjects was introduced with a good reaction from our customers. 'We make sure that the decorations cover not just the walls but also the windows, doors and roofs to maximise the effect.' There were five different themes used, including\u00a0an amusement park, European castles and a fairy tale world. Passenger Sying Tsao told local media: 'I didn't see them advertising things and then suddenly when I turned up for work one morning I saw that the carriages had this great new 3D designs. 'They were very realistic, I saw one child nervous about stepping on a 3D floor.

{"abstract": "Bryan Robson has praised Chris Smalling's recent performances, comparing him to United greats Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Smalling has been improving since his red card in the Manchester derby last November, and Robson believes a win at Liverpool this Sunday would be a great result for United. The former United captain is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who are currently two points behind City.", "article": "Bryan Robson has paid Chris Smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Five years after signing for United, Smalling is yet to convince many United fans he and Phil Jones are suitable long-term replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers. The 25-year-old has been the object of a few taunts, most recently in the Manchester derby last November when he was sent off in the 39th minute. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (centre) has impressed Bryan Robson in recent weeks. Robson believes Smalling's passing has been 'crisper' during his displays against Arsenal and Newcastle. Smalling, already on a booking, showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down James Milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and United went on to lose 1-0 against a City team that was there for the taking. Smalling has since shown signs of improvement, though. His commanding performance in last week's 3-0 victory over Tottenham caught Robson's eye and the former United captain thinks that bodes well for Louis van Gaal ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. Robson said: 'Chris is a good defender. I have seen him improve over the last few games. 'I even thought against Arsenal and Newcastle away, his passing was a lot better, a lot crisper, so he has come on to a good game, he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at Liverpool.' Smalling kept 26-goal striker Harry Kane quiet last Sunday and the former Fulham man ventured forward, striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions. The end product was not good enough to suggest Van Gaal has a new Beckenbauer in his squad just yet, but Robson was so impressed by Smalling's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre-back to two United greats in Pallister and McGrath. Smalling kept a close eye on Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Manchester United's win against Spurs. The former lifted 10 trophies at United and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 FA Cup had he not fought a long-running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club. 'Paul McGrath could do that and so could Gary Pallister,' Robson said when invited to liken Smalling's display to a figure from the past. 'When you keep possession at the back sometimes it's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area. 'That means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and I thought Chris did that particularly well against Tottenham and that made it difficult for the Tottenham players.' Smalling seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Robson has compared Smalling to former Manchester United defender McGrath. Smalling has also been compared with Gary Pallister (left, pictured with Peter Schmeichel in 1996) 'It's a great feeling know that people are taking notice,' Smalling said. 'I am just hoping I can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results.' Smalling will have to be at his very best again on Sunday at Anfield. Van Gaal has warned the centre-back - and the rest of his team-mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture. As well as pride and bragging rights, a place in the top four is at stake. Liverpool have not lost since they fell 3-0 at Old Trafford in December and a victory for the hosts would move them above United into fourth for the first time since August. Robson thinks victory against Liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the Reds' top-four hopes and is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who trail City by just two points after their loss at Burnley last weekend. 'Yes, (second) is a realistic target,' the former United captain said. 'We have to play City and Arsenal at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good. 'When you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like Tottenham. 'And a win at Liverpool at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us.'

And now the seven-bedroom former rectory once described by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall as 'perfect in every way' is on the market for \u00a33.15million. The Laines, set within five acres on the edge of Plumpton village in East Sussex, has a paddock, wide lawns, a secret garden, a swimming pool and tennis court. Dating back to the 18th Century, the\u00a0Grade-II listed home is spread over three floors and even boasts a\u00a0Gothic style orangery added in the Seventies. The Duchess of Cornwall's childhood home The Laines (pictured) in Plumpton, East Sussex, is on the market for \u00a33.15million. The former rectory\u00a0set within five acres on the edge of Plumpton village in East Sussex, has wide lawns and a swimming pool. It is only the second time in 63 years that the property comes to the market, pictured is the conservatory decorated with plants. It is only the second time in 63 years that the property has come to the market\u00a0and was home to Camilla's father Major Bruce Shand for 45 years. The former rectory was bought off him by actor James Wilby,\u00a0best known for his aristocratic roles in Maurice, Gosford Park and A Handful Of Dust, and his wife Shana. They decided to sell the home in August last year with a guide price of \u00a33.25million, but the couple have now dropped the price. Camilla has fond memories of the years she spent at the historic property with her siblings\u00a0Annabel and Mark after the family moved to\u00a0Sussex  to be near Sonia Cubitt, Camilla\u2019s maternal grandmother. It was from here that Camilla, aged four-and-a-half, started out for her first school, Dumbrell\u2019s, before\u00a0completing her education at Queens Gate School in Kensington and finishing schools in Switzerland and France. Prince Charles came to visit the house several times, both before Camilla\u2019s marriage and also later while on shore posting at Portsmouth during his Royal Navy service in the early Seventies. But the majority of the couple's secret assignations were made at Camilla\u2019s grandmother\u2019s home, Hall Place at West Meon. The Duchess of Cornwall (left) with her sister Annabel Shand in 1952 at The Laines and (right) with Prince Charles at their wedding.

The open plan kitchen and breakfast room in the Grade-II listed building has polished wooden surfaces, flooring and wooden beams. Major Bruce Shand lived at the home in East Sussex for 45 years, pictured in the gardens at the former rectory with his dog. The\u00a0gardens were re-designed by well-known landscape gardener, Lanning Roper, and include a walled kitchen garden (pictured) It was once reported that\u00a0Major Shand hauled Prince Charles to The Laines to confront him about the intense public scrutiny his daughter was under. But later it emerged that the husband of one of Camilla\u2019s best friends, Charles Benson, had sold the totally fallacious tale to fund a chronic gambling habit. At the time, because of the feverish atmosphere surrounding the disclosure of Charles and Camilla\u2019s relationship, the story seemed to have the ring of truth. Prince Charles has praised the way his wife has tackled the challenge of joining the royal family as \u2018brilliant\u2019 ahead of their 10th wedding anniversary next month and it remains to be seen whether he will buy the property. Since marrying the prince in 2005, Camilla \u2013 once one of the most hated women in Britain - has gone from being a middle-aged mother who lived much of her life out of the spotlight, to taking on a range of charitable patronages and learning about the rigours of royal engagements. The main rooms of the historic house have high ceilings and large Georgian windows with wonderful views of the garden and Downs. A spokesman for agent Strutt and Parker said: 'On the first floor there are seven main bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a shower room. The rooms to the south and east enjoy stunning views of the gardens and South Downs.

Guests at the party, which was attended by Nigel Farage\u2019s wife Kirsten, drank champagne, cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine. The event reportedly cost \u00a3950 and was paid by Mrs Atkinson\u2019 chief of staff Christine Hewitt on credit card, but she later returned to the restaurant and was given an invoice for \u00a33,150.

The Ukip leader was left 'deeply shocked' after suspending MEP Janice Atkinson. Hours later the party confirmed a second senior figure, the party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, had been suspended following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'. The final blow came when the party's candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Jonathan Stanley, sensationally quit claiming he was sick of the 'open racism and bullying' in the party. Mr Farage last week said: \u2018I was deeply shocked when I saw it. It was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life.\u2019 The party yesterday held a disciplinary hearing chaired independently by somebody from the legal profession with representatives of the national executive of Ukip.

Mrs Atkinson was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011. The 52-year-old found herself in hot water last year after she was recorded by TV cameras calling the wife of a Ukip supporter \u2018a ting tong from somewhere\u2019. She insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was \u2018incredibly sorry\u2019 for offending the woman. In December it emerged that she owed more than \u00a32,000 in child support to her ex-husband despite previously criticising \u2018feckless families\u2019 who have more children than they can afford. She has also been pictured sticking up her middle finger stuck up to a camera and was accused of swearing at protesters.

Welcome to the parallel universe of North Korea, where some of the hermit kingdom's brightest young minds have a lack of worldly knowledge which would shame a Western primary school student. In 2011 writer and journalist Suki Kim went undercover for two terms teaching English at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, just outside the capital of the world's most secretive country. Scroll down for video. Suki Kim (left), arrived for her first term in North Korea in July 2011 and left at the end of her second shortly after the country's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il (right), died in December of that year.

One student once asked her if it was true everyone in the world spoke Korean. Portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il hang on the wall above the blackboard. Posing as one of the Christian missionaries running the facility, Miss Kim spent months secretly documenting her experiences for a book, 'Without You, There Is No Us: My secret life teaching the sons of North Korea's elite'. The 270 boys aged 19-20 were the offspring of some of the regime's most loyal citizens - some of the few allowed to live in the capital outside of which the vast majority are stuck in grinding poverty in the countryside. Their new teacher was getting up at 5am every day to write-up notes she had taken on her experiences, making sure she copied everything to five USB sticks and left nothing on her laptop which could be spied on by her hosts. If Miss Kim, then aged 40, had been caught, she risked being branded a spy and being thrown in one of North Korea's gulags, or forced labour camps, where 120,000 political prisoners are thought to be held. Every piece of material for every lesson had to be submitted and approved for use by a shadowy group known as the 'counterparts' - North Korean staff overseeing the lessons of the foreign teachers who had been brought in.

And yet, for North Korea's best and brightest, 'photos of the United Nations, the Taj Mahal and the Great Pyramids of Giza elicited only blank expressions'. They knew about Bill Gates from their previous universities, but had no idea how Mark Zuckerberg and the website he created, Facebook, had revolutionised the way the rest of the world communicated. Miss Kim wrote: 'A few guessed the names of the Eiffel Tower and Stonehenge, but only after much hemming and hawing. 'Hardly anyone knew what country had first landed men on the moon, despite the fact that they were science and technology majors. 'Asked what year computers had been invented, most had no idea; it was only after much consultation that one team ventured a guess: 1870.' Miss Kim told MailOnline: 'In a way, why would they know? They have never been taught about the outside world. Three uniformed students on guard duty outside the IT building.

'But on another level they were the elite. If any of them did know more the fear and the consequences of being exposed were so great they never let it be known.' One student asked Miss Kim if it were true that everyone in the world spoke Korean, as it was'so superior that they spoke it in England, China and America.' Many of the boy's families lived as little as 10 minutes drive away in Pyongyang, but they were hardly ever allowed to see them or have any contact at all during term time. One student's father stopped by the campus to see him but was turned away and all he could do was leave a note.

The speech has caused a rift between the two sides, with some congressional Democrats boycotting the address and Iran accusing Netanyahu of trying to undermine the nuclear talks.", "article": "John Kerry tried to defuse the ongoing row over Benjamin Netanyahu's forthcoming speech to Congress - despite fears it will affect negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program. The Secretary of State said he did not want the Israeli's Prime Minister's forthcoming address to a joint session of Congress to become'some great political football'. Netanyahu's speech, organized by John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, was set up without the blessing of the Obama administration - and comes as the White House tries to strike a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Scroll down for video. Play ball: Secretary of State John Kerry, right, tried to stop a feud over Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu (left) escalating in an interview Sunday. On his way: Netanyahu is pictured above with his wife Sarah, leaving Tel Aviv for the address to Congress on Tuesday. It is feared that such a public show of closeness to Israel, a firm foe of Iran, could dash Obama's hopes in the negotiations, in which he hopes to curb the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. Kerry played up U.S.-Israeli unity in an interview on Sunday for ABC's This Week\u00a0show, insisting 'the prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. 'And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history.' There is, however, a clear different in policy between Netanyahu and the White House - with the Israeli leader expected to urge Congress to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime. Congress wants to keep the sanctions regime strong, but the President has said he would veto any new penalties to preserve the negotiations. Kerry reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying the White House deserved 'the benefit of the doubt' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached. By accepting an invitation from the Republican party to. address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the. Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech. before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol. Solemn: Netanyahu has claimed his visit is above the political, and says he is standing up for all Jews by visiting Washington. He is pictured above praying at Jerusalem's Western Wall. But both sides have tried to downplay the rift. In remarks on Saturday at Jersualem's Western Wall,. Netanyahu said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to say. that I respect U.S. President Barack Obama.' He added that he. believed in the strong bilateral ties and said, 'that strength. will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and. those yet to come.' Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on. Sunday. The Israeli prime minister, who is running for. re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being. above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for. all Jews. 'I'm going to Washington on a fateful, even historic,. mission,' he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv. 'I feel. that I am an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who. do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,' he told. reporters. Not popular: Anti-Israeli demonstrator are pictured above protesting in D.C. ahead of Netanyahu's address. Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to. approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama's pledge to. veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks. U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran. diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate. election stunt that will play well with voters back home. While White House and Israeli officials insist that key. areas of cooperation, from counter-terrorism to intelligence to. cyber security, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran. talks has shaped up as the worst in decades. Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate. between the Republican and Democratic camps. The planned. address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu's. government and some congressional Democrats. Some two dozen or. more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial. estimates. Iran itself has weighed in on the speech as well. Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister.

Meanwhile a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,. said the 'politicized' nature of his visit threatened 'what. undergirds the strength of the relationship'.

Three police officers have been questioned over alleged misconduct relating to the suspicious death of a 13-month-old baby whose case has been shrouded in official secrecy. Little Poppi Iris Worthington, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, died in December 2012. But a draconian order imposed by judges has prevented any details of her death being revealed, despite a long-running police probe. During an inquest in October last year that lasted a mere seven minutes, a coroner simply ruled that the cause of Poppi's death was 'unascertained' and failed to disclose any other information. But it has now emerged that three officers from Cumbria Police have been questioned under caution over misconduct allegations. It can also be revealed that one officer, who was suspended after concerns that the force did not respond \u2018properly and appropriately\u2019 to the girl's death, has since retired from the force. The news comes after the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said it would be investigating whether opportunities to obtain 'key evidence' were 'identified and appropriately acted upon'. The IPCC said it received a referral from Cumbria Police on June 27 last year and began its independent investigation on July 2. The body has since spoken to 13 witnesses and three police officers, who have been interviewed under caution. But the watchdog refused to disclose a copy of the Cumbria Police referral, which gives details of the exact allegations under investigation. A spokesman said the public interest in openness and transparency is 'outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations'. After Poppi's death, a far-reaching injunction prevented the media from revealing various details about the case, including the hospital in which she died. The opening of the inquest in also took place in private. According to coroners' rules, inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved. But following a challenge by media groups, the senior coroner for Cumbria, David Roberts, wrote to the Attorney General to ask for a new hearing. Lawyers representing several newspaper groups - Associated Newspapers Limited, which publishes MailOnline, Times Newspapers Ltd and Guardian News & Media- had written to Mr Roberts to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful. One officer, who was suspended over allegations the force did not response 'properly' to the young girl's death, has also since retired from the force. Cumbria police is being investigated by the police watchdog. In a written reply to law firm RPC, Mr Roberts, said: 'My own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place, not least so that conclusions as to how, when and where Poppi Worthington came by her death can be recorded. The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley (pictured) 'Neither I nor Mr Smith has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the High Court. However, it is open to me to seek a fiat (order) from the Attorney General to pursue an application under section 13 of the Coroners Act for an Order that a fresh inquest is to be held and I will now be doing so.' The police investigation had led to the arrest of two people, including Poppi's father Paul Worthington, 46. Last week it emerged the 46-year-old and a 30-year-old woman arrested will not face further action. The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley.

She said she was told she was going to have 'the best time of her life'.\u00a0But Ms O'Keefe said she was shocked at the result of the operation. 'I've been absolutely butchered,' she said. Scroll down for video. Ordeal: Courtney O'Keefe (pictured) contracted a life-threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a Thai hospital, later requiring a double mastectomy, said she was 'butchered' by cosmetic surgeons. With implants: Courtney O'Keefe is pictured here, with her implants, after spending more than six months in hospital for a deadly infection. Ms O'Keefe has since had the implants removed and a double mastectomy, but still has a long path of reconstructive surgery ahead. After they were taken out: This picture shows Ms O'Keefe's breasts after her implants were extracted from her body. She will receive re-constructive surgery from the Cosmetic Institute in Sydney, who have stumped up to assist her. Ms O'Keefe is pictured here following her double mastectomy, holding both of her implants in each hand. The implants were removed on December 17. Ms O'Keefe has not worked since she was struck down by the infection. Ms O'Keefe said she was in 'agony' upon returning to Australia and her mother whisked her to hospital shortly after she arrived back home in Perth. 'We went straight to Armidale Emergency,' she said. 'I was there for 5 minutes and she admitted me up to a room. 'I was in an isolation room becaues they didnt have any clue what I had... They swabbed, and it took four days to figure out what it was.' It was the beginning of a six month ordeal, with Ms O'Keefe spending time at both Armidale and Fremantle hospitals. She was diagnosed with the rare bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, which the Centre for Disease Control said is often contracted by patients in hospital, particularly those with wounds from surgery or hooked up to medical devices. Ms O'Keefe is pictured here after her stay in hospital, when she still had implants. Her condition worsened. 'It was also turning septic and was starting to shut down my liver, my kidneys, my heart, my brain,' she said. 'Mum and Dad had to come and say goodbye to me twice,' said Ms O'Keefe. Doctors called in respected specialists to treat the condition, and they concocted a special substance to fight it. A PIC (peripherally inserted central catheter) was installed inside her so she could receive a constant stream of antibiotics. On December 17, 2014, nearly a year after her ordeal, surgeons removed her implants because the infection had returned. Because the infection had spread to her surrounding tissue, both her breasts were also removed. 'I will never be able to life a normal life': Ms O'Keefe is pictured following the surgery to remove both of her breasts. But her ordeal is not completely over.\u00a0Ms O'Keefe has suffered kidney and liver problems because of the medication required to treat her infection. She told Daily Mail Australia she had coughed up blood and that doctors said she may require surgery if she does not improve. She lost her job and has not worked since the ordeal began. She had to move back in with her mother. And she's devastated. 'I'm never going to live a normal life,' she said. Ms O'Keefe urged Australians examining plastic surgery overseas to reconsider.
