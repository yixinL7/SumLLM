Kostrzewa allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files, which were stored in his airing cupboard. Kostrzewa was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police after contacting the Polish embassy to sell the papers.", "article": "Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files. A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for \u00a350,000, a court heard today. Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer\u2019s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard. They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer\u2019s door to complain about noise - but he became \u2018infatuated\u2019 with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as \u2018spy games\u2019, \u2018spies\u2019 and \u2018secret documents\u2019 - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took \u2018sensitive or secret material\u2019 and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent. Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive. The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines. Base: Mr Spencer is an engineer on submarines in the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told. Mr Spencer\u2019s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was \u2018infatuated with Shane\u2019. Mr Chalk said: \u2018He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.\u2019 That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen. Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa\u2019s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying \u2018you reject me, you reject me\u2019. The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour\u2019s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had \u2018lost\u2019 Mr Spencer. Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told the Polish man took'sensitive or secret material' and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Miss Berriman also found that she had lost her key to her boyfriend\u2019s flat and Kostrzewa let her into the shared entrance - and then allegedly said he had found her key on the floor of a Co-op store. She was surprised that the key had fallen off the tight-fitting keyring. In the covert recording with the agent Alex, the defendant allegedly said he had \u2018acquired keys to Shane Spencer\u2019s flat\u2019. Mr Chalk said on various dates in March 2014, Kostrzewa used search engines on his computer, entering words including \u2018spy games, secret documents, spies, consulate Republic of Poland\u2019. Mr Spencer went to Gibraltar to work from March 19 to 25. The prosecutor said: \u2018He then offered to sell off the documents relating to UK submarines to the Polish government.\u2019 In April agent Alex rang the Pole and they met on April 10 in Plymouth, going to a hotel room which was rigged up with hidden recording gear. He allegedly said he found a key to access the flat and stole the relevant papers and planned to copy Mr Spencer\u2019s hard drive - and wanted \u00a350,000 for the information. Alex said he 'needed time to consider the documents'. In the recorded conversation, the defendant said \u2018this is only the beginning\u2019. Aerial view: The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer at Devonport (above) and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines.

The Englishman escaped a red card after referee Craig Thomson sent off team-mate Paul Paton instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final. That decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on Wednesday, when Celtic will also challenge the red administered to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. Celtic have slammed the SFA\u2019s decision to let Dundee United's Calum Butcher play in the League Cup final. Celtic will challenge the red shown to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. United\u2019s Nadir Ciftci \u2013 already banned from the Hampden showpiece \u2013 faces a further two-match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at Parkhead skipper Scott Brown. But Celtic are furious that Butcher will be free to play in the final, even if Paton is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice. A club statement read: \u2018It seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that, in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed, the Dundee United player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer \u2013 and would be available to play in the League Cup Final and the Scottish Cup replay between the teams \u2013 while Celtic\u2019s player (van Dijk) may potentially miss both of those matches. \u2018Celtic and Virgil van Dijk maintain their position that no red-card offence was committed by Virgil. Virgil will appear at Hampden to put his case on Thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal.\u2019 United refused to comment publicly on Tuesday night, but are privately furious at some of Celtic\u2019s comments. Brown, meanwhile, has escaped retrospective punishment for his tackle on Ciftci. The United striker lashed out in retaliation at the Scotland midfielder before van Dijk and United\u2019s Paton were controversially dismissed by Thomson on the advice of assistant Graham Chambers. Celtic's Scott Brown  accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head. There will be no SFA action against Tannadice winger Aiden Connolly, however, despite claims by Celtic the youngster dived to win a penalty in the Scottish Cup stalemate. Expressing relief that Brown has been cleared to play on Sunday, team-mate Stefan Johansen said the SFA had reached the right decision in that regard. \u2018I saw the tackle from Broony,\u2019 said the Norwegian. \u2018It was just a tackle and everything else was just a lot of players around it. \u2018He would have been a big loss - but I didn\u2019t think that was going to happen. He is the captain and means a lot to the team. We could see how important he is to the team when he was out at the start of the season. He\u2019s a great player and a fantastic captain. He gives it out but he takes it back. That is part of his game. It\u2019s not only him in this league who makes hard tackles.\u2019 The failure to penalise Brown\u2019s challenge was blamed by United boss Jackie McNamara for sparking the incident which saw Ciftci lash out with his boot. Offered a fast-track two-match ban by the SFA compliance officer, Ciftci has until 3pm today to respond to the complaint. If he declines, a Fast Track Tribunal will convene tomorrow. Failure to win his appeal would see the striker miss the Scottish Cup replay with Celtic and the subsequent Premiership clash between the sides. Despite rising tensions, Johansen believes the League Cup final will not go the same way as the Scottish Cup tie \u2013 which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period. \u2018It was a weird game, with three red cards and two penalties,\u2019 he said. \u2018It affects the game, of course, but I think it will be different this time. I don\u2019 t think what happened on Sunday will affect the final. It\u2019s a new game and a trophy is at stake for the winners. \u2018I am just focusing on ourselves.

{"abstract": "Cancer survival rates in the UK are more than a decade behind those in other European countries, according to research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The study, which compared survival rates across Europe, found that even for breast cancer, one of the most treatable forms of the disease, the UK lagged behind France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s. The UK\u2019s five-year survival rate for lung cancer is currently 10%, compared to 11% in Austria, Germany and Italy in the late 1990s.", "article": "Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, experts warn. Even for breast cancer \u2013 one of the most treatable forms of the disease \u2013 the figures are still well below those reached by France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s. For lung cancer, the rates are so far behind that patients in Britain are now half as likely to survive as those living in Austria. Macmillan Cancer Support has described the situation as \u2018shameful\u2019 and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in Europe. Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the UK's survival rates (file picture, posed by models) And despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years \u2013 \u00a3640million invested by Labour in the early 2000s and \u00a3750million by the Tories \u2013 Britain does not appear to have gained any ground. In 2002 Labour increased National Insurance tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then Chancellor Gordon Brown specifically to pay for major improvements in the NHS, notably cancer care. But only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by MPs warned of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 variation in care. Data analysed by Macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in Britain survive five years. This is a lower rate than France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s, when the figure was 83 per cent. In these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher. For bowel cancer, 54 per cent of Britons can expect to survive five years, whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in Finland and 55 per cent in Norway, the Netherlands and France. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries, including Austria, Germany and Italy, it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u2018Frankly, this is shameful. What we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable. \u2018If countries like Sweden, France, Finland and Austria can achieve these rates, then the UK can, and should, bridge the gap.\u2019 Experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough, before it has spread to other organs. It may also be down to patients not being offered the newest, most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures, which are routinely available in other countries. This is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail. Experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the NHS cannot cope with the ever-increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer. It is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes. The figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of European countries carried out by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, known as the \u2018Concord programme\u2019. Meanwhile, the latest monthly NHS statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as X-rays, CT scans or ultrasounds \u2013 up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since February 2008. It follows a report by MPs warning of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and \u2018unexplained\u2019 variation in cancer detection and treatment across England \u2013 particularly for the elderly.

{"abstract": "A principal scientist from Gillette has revealed the science behind shaving, including how hairs behave, why washing the skin is vital, and why you should never tap your razor on the sink. The scientist recommends showering before shaving to allow water to penetrate the hair, which makes it easier to cut. Additionally, the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience.", "article": "When it comes to shaving, boys are normally taught the art by their fathers or older brothers. But this means bad habits can also be passed down through generations. Now a principal scientist from Gillette has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave, why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink. She also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain. Scroll down for video. Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns in diameter (left) but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. Washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said Gillette principal scientist Kristina Vanoosthuyze. Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze has worked in the Gillette Shaving Technology area at the Innovation Centre in Reading for the past nine years. Every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses, high-speed  cameras and special high-intensity lighting. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair, and in the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade   pulls the hair up,  the second cuts it, the third blade acts in a similar way to the first, and so on. In some of their products, Gillette also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades. This footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair. Every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high-speed cameras. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair. In the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade pulls the hair up, the second cuts it, the third blade pulls and so on. When hydrated, skin is also tighter (an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right). This exposes more of the hair's surface area to the blade. \u00a0As a result Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round. This image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin. Dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut.\u00a0Additionally, the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving glide. Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. This increases the surface area that the blades can cut through, and when hydrated, skin is plumper, which reveals more of the hair. Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull:\u00a0The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave:\u00a0This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. As a result it makes more sense to shower before shaving and not the other way round. 'Allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut,' explained Dr Vanoosthuyze. 'In fact, dry hair can have the strength of copper wire. When hair hydrates, it swells and becomes easier to cut. 'So, men should wash the face and neck with a mild cleanser before the shave. Or at least take a shower before the shave and not the other way around. 'Additionally, the lubricating ingredients formulated in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience.' Scanning electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin, for example. On the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg, while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top. The hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust. The skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on", "candidates": [["The science behind shaving has been revealed by a principal scientist from Gillette, Kristina Vanoosthuyze.

A top grammar school has been fined \u00a310,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries.\u00a0The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal ball at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent. The boy, who was formerly a keen rugby player, has been told he will never play again. The victim had been part of a class of 24 Year nine pupils taking part in a multi-sports PE lesson on June 20 last year hugely over-subscribed grammar school. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. The pupil suffered a severely fractured skull and was rushed to Kings College Hospital in London. He was due to have an operation to alleviate the swelling in his brain but it was decided the surgery could have worsened his condition. A few days later his condition deteriorated and he underwent emergency brain surgery to remove fluid from the brain. The school's governing body was hauled in front of Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court today charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. Prosecuting, Kevin Golding said: 'It's unclear what the long term impact will be. 'He has recovered sufficiently to return to school but we don't yet know the long term impact on his memory, intellect, mood, personality and his future employment prospects.' The court heard the teacher in charge, David Joseph, has taught at Judd for 10 years, and has been a teacher for 28 years overall. He was in the centre of the sports field overlooking the javelin throwing pupils when the incident happened. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle, the court heard. He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit the victim on the head. Defending, Dominic Adamson said that although the boy's injuries were the result of an unfortunate accident, the health and safety procedures in place were not conducive to a serious risk of it happening. The court heard the victim was a very keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed rugby. Because of the injuries he sustained and the indentation to his skull, it was said that he will never play again. Mr Golding said: 'The victim was seriously injured and fortunate not to have suffered fatal injuries. 'He has sadly suffered life changing injuries which could have been avoided. 'He was a very keen sportsman, particularly his love of rugby, and the damage and indentation he still has at the base of his skull means he can't play rugby anymore. 'He and his family have endured a difficult nine months and face more difficult times ahead.' Chair of the bench Nick Bensted-Smith said the victim had suffered a'very serious and devastating injury' as a result of the incident and the school received a fine of \u00a310,000, legal costs of \u00a31,375 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120.

The teacher is not facing any disciplinary action by the school and has not been charged with any criminal offences. The Judd School pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to ensure that a child in their care was, so far as is reasonably practicable, not exposed to risks to their health or safety. They suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place.

The judge, who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from Tower Hamlets in East London, also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care. He said the ban was a \u00a0'draconian' step, as was the removal of the passport. Mr Justice Hayden told the hearing: 'But the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in Syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely. 'As I said early this week in another case, and I repeat it in this, sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people, ultimately from themselves. The judge said the ban was a 'draconian' step, but necessary to protect the girls. Pictured: Aleppo, Syria. 'Therefore I am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought.' The girls and adults concerned, who were not in court today, can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish. The judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family. He also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services, and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position. 'It seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls.' Authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants. The ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16-year-old boy from Brighton from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. The judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region. Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February. Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting. Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales. In February Sharmeena Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. All four schoolgirls attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. Sharmeena is now living in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride and told her father she will never come home.", "candidates": [["A judge has barred five teenage girls from travelling to Syria, making them wards of court and removing their passports.

After he found his biological mother 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, the white British woman told him she conceived him after a one-night stand with Chamberlain, he told\u00a0Sports Illustrated. Documents with background information about Levi's biological parents noted that Elizabeth would not identify the father to protect his name, and that she gave Levi up for adoption because she felt she could not raise a bi-racial child. Scroll down for video. During a 12-year long search to find his birth parents, Aaron Levi (left), 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player, Wilt Chamberlain, is his father. But Chamberlain, who died in 1999, claimed that he would never have a child. The 7'1' star, who once scored 100 points in one game, boasted about having slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above.\u00a0He worked out he slept with, on average, 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Even though the 7'1' star claimed he slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above, he maintained until he died in 1999 that he did not have any children. Chamberlain, who once scored 100 points in one game, worked out he slept with on average 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Levi, who stands at 6'5' tall, said that had he known the San Francisco Warrior  player was his father 20 years ago, when Chamberlain was still alive, his life would have been completely different. Born in 1965, Levi was raised in Oregon by adoptive parents Don and Harriet, and only knew very few details about his birth parents growing up. 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, said she met Chamberlain at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out with him a few nights later. She said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment, and that night Levi was conceived. He began the search for them in 2003 and got closer to answers after collecting background information  in 2004. The information, which is believed to be provided entirely by Elizabeth, said that Levi's mother was a white woman of English-French descent; while details of his father included that he was was a black professional basketball player who was 6'10', born in Kansas and held a Masters degree. However, the details did not exactly match with those of Chamberlain: the NBA star was from Philadelphia and attended the University of Kansas for only three years without obtaining a degree. As he continued to search for more answers, in 2009, Levi received a birth certificate with Elizabeth's name and was eventually connected with her. He said: 'It's been a burden on me to feel that I am her secret, and I am Wilt's secret, and I am the Chamberlain family's secret. 'That's been hard for me...I already know what's going to happen if I don't do anything. I'm going to have an unfinished journey.' After a more than hour-long conversation, she revealed the details of her 'casual relationship' with Chamberlain. Elizabeth said they met at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out a few nights later, when she said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment. When Chamberlain learned of the news that Elizabeth was pregnant, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' That night, she conceived Levi and five months later told him she was pregnant and had plans to give the child up for adoption. When Chamberlain learned of the news, he  chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' Levi has tried to reach out to some of Chamberlain's relatives who remain closed to meeting him and refuse to participate in DNA tests because they feel doubts surround his claim. In his continued mission of self-discovery, he hopes to inspire other people who have been adopted to begin their searches earlier than he did. Levi and Elizabeth met in person in 2010, where they had different feelings about Chamberlin, and spent time together again in England last Fall. He said: 'I wanted her to tell me something good about him, but that wasn't going to happen. I realized that we had different feelings about him. 'She sees him as a womanizer...to me, he's my father.'", "candidates": [["Aaron Levi, a San Francisco man, has claimed he is the son of the late former Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers NBA star Wilt Chamberlain.

The 60-year-old mother of two, from Lower Hutt, told Daily Mail Australia the rant had started for more than half an hour on the bus before she stepped in. 'I ignored it for a good half an hour,' Ms Walker said. 'The guys didn't know their way around the area so another lady and I tried to direct them to their destination but then they started to get abused by that man. 'I don't see myself as a hero. I just needed to stand up for myself and the guys because of what he said. He also abused me and called me names.' In the video, Ms Walker is heard speaking back at the old man, telling him to 'behave'.

A female passenger named Pene Walker (pictured) was hailed a hero after she intervened to defend the two men. 'Shut your mouth up. Get f***,' the man said to Ms Walker, who was sitting a couple of rows in front. Ms Walker then turns around and says 'excuse me' before the man continues to verbally abuse her. 'Come on then - I'll take your back,' the man said. 'F*** turn around, turn around. Shut your mouth up b****.'

Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia. Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers. Ministers have ordered an urgent investigation into the school attended by Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) after it emerged two dead extremist fighters \u00a0- including Choukri Ellekhlifi (right) - were also taught there. Yesterday the Government announced an urgent internal review into whether enough had been done at the school. Mrs Morgan has ordered officials to examine all evidence, including school records and inspection findings, to establish whether enough was done to prevent teenagers becoming radicalised. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming  extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern', a spokesman said. The spokesman added:\u00a0'The Secretary of State has asked them to review all schools that fit this category. 'Our understanding of the challenge, and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely in the past few years. Quintin Kynaston Academy's (pictured) head insisted the school is 'not a breeding ground for terrorists' 'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.' The Telegraph reports both Ellekhlifli and Sakr were 'close associates' of Emwazi. Ellekhlifi was fighting alongside al-Qaeda linked extremists in Syria when he was killed by government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11, 2013.

Sakr was fighting with al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate, which has been responsible for a series of atrocities including the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed. Quintin Kynaston Academy's current headteacher has insisted the school is not a breeding ground for terrorists. Alex Atherton told The Telegraph: 'QK has been proactive in working with the government's Prevent strategy, and this has resulted in positive work around the well-being and safety of our students. 'Students that may have attended nine years ago are not a reflection of the students we are proud of having at QK, and we will continue to put in place support mechanisms to make sure all our students feel safe and that they can raise any concerns.' One unnamed man who claimed to be a student alongside Ellekhlifi at QK told the paper he and his friends saw 'quite a lot of young men going towards a radicalised direction', but said he didn't realise the extent of it, adding 'It was a massive shock' when he learnt that Ellekhlifi went to Syria.

{"abstract": "Former Formula One driver John Watson assesses McLaren's troubled start to the season and the disappointing curtain raiser in Melbourne. He believes that the sport needs to decide whether it is an entertainment or a technical game, and that the lack of testing is hindering McLaren's chances of improving this term. Watson also expresses concern about the financial struggles of many teams in the pit-lane and the lack of substantial company coming in as a title sponsor to any team.", "article": "John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, he assesses McLaren's troubled start to the season and the disappointing curtain raiser in Melbourne. John Watson (right) pictured last year with Sir Jackie Stewart, Karun Chandhok and Damon Hill. McLaren have moved from Mercedes engines to Honda and it is a bit like any relationship; it takes time. Formula One has gone down the route of trying to cut costs, and as a result, we have seen a substantial cut in track testing which will hinder McLaren's chances of improving this term. I would like to see teams allowed to test more simply because I think the public is beginning to wonder what we\u2019re watching. Are we seeing an exercise in extremely high-level technical games or are we looking at Formula One as an entertainment and sport? What is Formula One's objective? And where does it see itself going? I understand that TV viewing figures in Germany for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix were down nearly 50 per cent  on the norm and I don\u2019t think that is very good sign. Lewis Hamilton won the season-opening race in Australia ahead of \u00a0Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton led from start-to-finish as Mercedes dominated the first race of the new Formula One season. Maybe in Britain it wasn\u2019t so bad because of Lewis Hamilton's recent success, but there is a downside to domination, and we saw that at the turn of the century with Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, and then with four years of Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel. My big concern, and I hope I am not being over-reactionary here, is that there are so many teams in the pit-lane that are struggling financially. Giedo van der Garde's legal case against Sauber in Melbourne was hugely embarrassing and dominated the agenda at the Australian Grand Prix. It is systematic of where Formula One is right now. Driver talent is clearly secondary to budgets, albeit with a few exceptions at the sharp end of the grid. Teams desperately need funding. My other worry is whether global companies are looking at F1 as a sport which they want to commit to. I don\u2019t see any substantial company coming in as a title sponsor to any team. Hamilton is bidding to become the first British driver to win consecutive Formula One world championships. Pastor Maldonado crashed on the opening lap while Lotus team-mate Romain Grosjean retired moments later. The sport, whether it is the governing body, the FIA or CVC, Formula One\u2019s commercial rulers, need to sit down and say \"what are we doing?\" \"what are we trying to achieve?\" and \"are we achieving it?\" Last year we did have some good races, but I don\u2019t want to see another grand prix like Melbourne where at the end of the opening lap we had effectively just 13 cars running. Manor didn't get out of their garage. Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat suffered mechanical gremlins on their way to the grid. And both Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado failed to complete a lap. It is not acceptable. Formula One let itself down and it is a shame because the opening round of the championship, particularly with Melbourne being the sporting capital of the world, had a poor race. In the case of both McLaren and Honda, make no mistake, the achievement of getting back to the top as quickly as possible is absolutely paramount. They are a team who have won multiple world championships, but the last two years have been their worst since 1981. But I am confident they know what they have got to do, and they have put steps in place to rectify their problems. Jenson Button finished in last place, and two laps down on race winner Hamilton at the 2015 curtain-raiser. Kevin Magnussen, who deputised for Fernando Alonso, waves to the crowd ahead of the race in Melbourne. This year there is a four-engine limit for the entire season. So, combine that with the limited testing, and restrictions on engines, and how are engine manufacturers, particularly somebody coming into this Formula, such as Honda, expected to catch up, let alone match, those who started last year? Mercedes began their programme way back in 2011 and what you are seeing is the culmination of a lot of work which was done parallel to the team competing in 2012 and 2013. Renault were distracted with winning titles with Vettel and Red Bull while Ferrari didn't appear to grasp what was required. That is fundamentally why Mercedes hold the advantage. They had the wisdom to start out ahead of the game. Honda are having to play catch-up in public which is painful for them and McLaren.

But the off-the-grid property, made of glass and wood, isn't just known for it's sweeping views of the city of Bergen below. In order to reach the small architectural marvel, guests are required to crawl through its tunnel-like entryway, which remarkably resembles an otherworldly black hole. High above the city of Bergen in Norway sits the Tubakuba cabin, which boasts a very unusual, vortex-like entryway. Made up entirely of glass and wood, staying overnight in the cabin is free for families with young children. Designed as part of a workshop at the Bergen School of Architecture, OPA Form Architect, Espen Folgero was the mastermind behind the striking cabin. It's name is inspired by the tuba, thanks in large part to its curved entryway that opens like a vortex to the woods outside. The interior is made of plywood, while the exterior is crafted from burnt larch that has been treated with a traditional Japanese method called Shou Sugi Ban to prevent fungal decay. It's the portal-like entrance that's really something special, however, made up of curved shavings of pine and untreated larch, which will turn gray with time. The interior is made of plywood and has floor to ceiling windows along one side to allow guests to experience the breathtaking views. There is no electricity and the cabin's amenities are basic with only a wooden stove, bare wooden platforms and lofted sleeping space. To reach the inside of the 14-square-metre cabin, everyone must crawl through the house's 'black hole' tunnel entrance. Best of all, for families with young children, it's free to stay overnight in the playful space. The 14-square-metre cabin offers basic amenities, such as a wood stove, bare wooden platforms and a lofted sleeping area. There's no electricity, but the property is so small that it doesn't require much heating. And it's the view that guests truly stop by for: large windows overlooking the rocky mountainside give visitors the impression that they are 'floating' above the valley below. Every detail of the tunnel was considered, right down to the the use of untreated larch wood, which will turn grey with time. These drawings show exactly how the architecture students envisioned guests relaxing in the lofted sleeping spaces. Referred to as a 'wooden bubble,' the property has since been nominated for a European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture. Sketching was an important part of the students' learning process and helped them identify structural problems and solutions. The tuba-like tunnel is not just a way to reach the cabin's interior, it's also a play space in and of itself for children if the hut is closed. Speaking to Fast Company, architect Espen Folgero explained the concept behind the avant garde house. 'The entrance is shaped like a mouth of a tuba to experiment with wood as a material, to give children a place to play even if the hut is closed, and to force adults to crouch to get in, even if kids don't have to,' he said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Tubakuba has been nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture-Mies van de Rohe Award.", "candidates": [["A glass and wood cabin on Norway's Seven Mountains has been nominated for a European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture.

In her early twenties Marika Magriplis, from Sydney, used to be too small for an Australian dress size six while working in a corporate job and living off a diet of convenience food including noodles and cheap burgers. Today - after overhauling her diet and lifestyle in 2010 - she\u2019s just two weeks from giving birth to her first child and credits exercise and nutrient-rich meals with her 'having nothing to whinge about while pregnant\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been lucky with my diet and lifestyle but I\u2019ve got away with very minimal side effects with this pregnancy,\u2019 Marika told Daily Mail Australia. Her feet \u2018only swelled up once\u2019 and instead of wishing to indulge in sweat treats her only craving has been \u2018tuna with vinegar\u2019. Scroll down for video. 'In the last week he has had another spurt... 22 days to go':\u00a0Marika Magriplis, who is nine months pregnant (left), has credited working out (right) with keeping nasty pregnancy side effects at bay. The 29-year-old, a qualified personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, ditched her unhealthy lifestyle in 2010. Since 2012, when she first began competing in bodybuilding competitions around Australia, Marika has spent six days of the week weight training and eating a protein-rich diet. After becoming pregnant she adapted her training, with the help of experts, by reducing her weight sessions each trimester and including more calorie-dense foods into her diet to feed her growing bump. \u2018My training became more about core strengthening than building,\u2019 Marika said. \u2018Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off. At one stage \u2013 about halfway through my pregnancy I had really bad back pain because I made the weights too light - my body needed the strength,\u2019 she explained. However, now with just 14 days until her due date Marika has stopped weight-lifting altogether as she prepares to become a mum. Marika explained that she has kept up weights during pregnancy to maintain strength, not to build muscle like before. Marika's amazing transformation from a tiny 39 kilos to a strong bodybuilder came after she began lifting weights and learning about nutrition. \u2018Physically I\u2019ve made peace and listen to my body now and I\u2019ve dropped back on the training side of things. Now it\u2019s a about prenatal yoga and a lot of stretching and preparing the body for birth.\u2019 Marika, who is now a qualified personal trainer, weighed 39 kilos in 2007 after graduating from uni. \u2018I was tiny just through lack of knowledge\u2026 health wasn\u2019t a priority it was just about making money,\u2019 she explained. When she was competing as a bodybuilder before she was pregnant, Marika's daily diet would include:. Morning. An omelette with two whole eggs and three egg whites with cucumber or broccoli or green beans on the side. 'Its sounds odd for breakfast but it has everything you need, essential fats and fibre  from the veg and protein from the egg whites,' Marika said. Lunch. Fish or chicken, basically a lean white protein, with some salad and some nuts. Snack. Greek yoghurt (around 150 grams) with a handful of nuts and some protein powder. Dinner. White or sweet potato with meat and veg. 'I would have carbs after weight training. It breaks all the rules but if you think about your body as a machine, you need to refuel and  carbs work as energy. 'If you have fats in the morning, keeping them separately for different needs,' Marika explained. Exercise. Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding. After weights she would have a banana and a protein shake. On day seven Marika would balance weights with a slow walk along the beaches near her home. This was her 'active recovery day'. Marika said one of her favourite core exercises before she was pregnant was 'hanging leg raises'. After she became pregnant with her first child, Marika took advice from her chiropractor, midwife and physio and adapted her workout routine and diet. Morning. Multi-grain bread, oats, or muesli with fruit. Or eggs on toast. Snack. Greek yoghurt and nuts. Or a nut and muesli bar when nauseous. 'I couldn\u2019t even think about eating chicken and greens. The thought of it just made me want to throw up, it was a big adjustment,' Marika said. Lunch. Tuna as well as fresh fruit. Dinner. Similar to before pregnancy.

David Cameron should rule out coalition with any other party after the general election, according to Boris Johnson. The London Mayor suggests it would be 'fatal' for the Conservative Party to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power-sharing deal with the Liberal Democrats or another smaller party. 'We should say \"stuff coalition with anyone\",' Mr Johnson told the Daily Mail. 'We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. 'If we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party, it would be absolutely fatal.' Asked whether the Prime Minister should rule out a second coalition altogether, Mr Johnson replied: 'Yes. Otherwise people don't know what they are voting for.' Lord Steel says there is no appetite among Liberal Democrats for another coalition \u2013 or among the two big parties. 'A lot of David Cameron's Tories want a Tory-only government, even if it's a minority one, and similarly on the Labour side,' the former Liberal leader told the BBC. 'I suspect \u2013 if you have to look into the crystal ball \u2013 that we're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament, which is something new, and they'll be able to play one off against the other.' He said the most that Lib Dems would countenance in another hung parliament would be a 'confidence and supply deal', where they agreed to support a larger party in key votes but did not enter a formal coalition or take ministerial jobs. He also said that his party needed to'recharge its values'. Mr Johnson, who is Mr Cameron's chief leadership rival, criticised the fixed-term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition \u2013 suggesting it should be repealed. 'The sooner it expires, the better. I always thought it was some bit of Lib Dem nonsense,' he said. 'Constitutionally the thing we need to address is the rank injustice that it takes so many thousands more votes to elect a Conservative rather than Labour MP. It's an absolute scandal.' Former Conservative minister Sir Alan Duncan has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed-term legislation, branding it a'recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings'. Labour's Jack Straw and Tory Kenneth Clarke support the move. Critics say five years is too long, risking a 'zombie parliament' in the final year. Few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election. Boris Johnson - considered Mr Cameron's main rival for the Tory leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election. It means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the Queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable. Instead, they need to win the support of a'supermajority' of two thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period. This means the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents. The only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no-confidence. But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. A new coalition could therefore take power without an election.

Three teenage thugs whose terrifying gang battle with knives and a hammer was caught on camera have been jailed. An imitation gun was fired and a teenage girl was battered to the ground as children watched on in horror while the group of 20 thugs 'bristling with weapons' brawled in the streets of Wolverhampton in April  last year. Footage taken on a mobile phone captured the horrifying scenes as they unfolded outside the Britannia Hotel before the violence\u00a0spilled into the hotel foyer. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the battle took place between the Firetown and the 623 gangs who joined forces to confront another unnamed rival group. An imitation firearm was fired in the air by a 16-year-old who then pointed the weapon at another of the girls while Connor Chambers, 17, was seen waving a knife at a rival. The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19. The schoolboy fled into the foyer of the Britannia Hotel where he was involved in a scuffle and was later found to have suffered a stab wound to the chest that required five stitches. Three teenagers were jailed and two handed a community order after the brawl in front of shocked shoppers. Chambers, now aged 18, of Oxley, Wolverhampton, was handed an 18-month detention and training order after he was found guilty of possession of a knife.

The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19. The innocent girls were part of a group who had just arrived in the city to enjoy a night out but found themselves thrust into the middle of the gangland row. A teenage girl was struck with a hammer as children watched on in horror while a group of thugs brawled in the streets of Wolverhampton. Fairclough, 19, of Shifnal, Shrops., agreed to be bound over for 12 months at a previous hearing. The boy with the gun, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given an 18-month detention and training order. The 15-year-old boy with the hammer admitted possession of an offensive weapon, assault and affray and received an 18-month youth rehabilitation order under supervision and an eight-month night time curfew. The 70-second clip filmed by a witness showed two youths launching their attack and battering two young women as they cowered on the ground at 8pm.

This came after a photograph of the player urinating into his own mouth went viral on social media last June. Mr Carney's contract was torn up after a photo emerged of the player urinating in his own mouth. The committee\u2019s findings state that the former Dally M medallist should have been allowed an opportunity to plead his case in front of the Cronulla board. Cronulla Sharks chairman Damien Keough said the club will respect the decision made by the appeals committee, adding it is their responsibility to follow correct procedure. \u201cThe big oversight was that someone needed to check that the process being followed was correct,\u2019\u2019 Keogh told The Telegraph. Mr Carney's agent claims the photo was a set up and 'an optical illusion' \u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember here is that it\u2019s not a question of the facts, it\u2019s a question of the process, but the reality of the situation is, the decision would likely have been the same. He said he wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of the former Origin player returning to the league but 'there has been a lot of water that has flown under the bridge since last June.' There's no denying Mr Carney is a talented player, however, his antics off the field have led to the termination of three contracts. The Daily Mail Australia reached out to the Cronulla Sharks however they declined to comment. Mr Carney is currently in France nursing broken ribs, sustaining the injury in only his second game for the English Super League Club Catalans. After what most believed was ultimately the end of the troubled player's career, the five-eighth may surprise us all by staging a return to the league. The disgraced player fled to France to pick up the pieces of his damaged career where he sustained a rib injury. As Cronulla is the third team to terminate a contract with the fallen star, the question remains, which team would be game to pick up the controversial player? Paul Gallen has spoken out on Triple M Radio saying he thinks Mr Carney should allowed to return to the league however he would need a strict contract to curb his bad behaviour. \u2018If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life,\u2019 says Paul Gallen. \u2018If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life.\u2019 Rumours are flying on Twitter that the Manly Sea Eagles might be in the market for a five-eighth after the Kieran Foran announced he would be moving to Parramatta in the 2016 season.

But at least one neighbour is upset about plans to install air conditioning in five rooms, including in the new gym and wine cellar. Moving in: The Beckhams are spending \u00a35million on building work before they move into their new London home, pictured, but a neighbour has complained over plans to install air conditioning. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria\u2019s shoe collection. Portfolio: The couple, pictured together at a charity dinner, have applied for planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence after they sold Beckingham Palace in Hertfordshire - they already have homes in California, France and Dubai. One resident has written to the local council and said he 'totally disagrees' with the plans, which 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. MailOnline understands that the complainant is worried about air conditioning units being attached to the mansion, because of the visual impact and the humming noise. His letter said: 'The council must identifed (sic) our deep concerns about all adverse impacts on living conditions from noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from construction and from associated traffic, in addition to concerns about impacts on drainage, on appearance and landscape, on structural stability, and on historic buildings.' The Beckhams have hired designer Rose Uniacke to oversee the project and plans for 'internal alterations at all levels' were approved in February this year. This included the enlargement of the lower ground floor wine cellar and the installation of a retractable cinema screen. They also want to re-configure two bathrooms while removing a third-floor guest bathroom to form an extended bedroom and sitting room. When ready, the  home will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room. The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria\u2019s shoe collection. Staff and security will have access to a tunnel which will take them unseen to a second property. The couple have already installed a sound system so that music can be played in every room, and which can be controlled by a phone or computer. They are planning on adding specially designed waterproof plasma TVs in every bathroom. Their children Brooklyn, 16; Romeo, 12; Cruz, ten; and daughter Harper, three, will take over the second floor of the house which has three bedrooms, all with en-suite bathrooms.

Family: David Beckham  takes a selfie of himself and his children (L-R) Brooklyn Beckham, Romeo Beckham, Cruz Beckham and Harper Beckham, before Victoria's event at New York Fashion Week. All the children will have huge amounts of space in the mansion. Particulars: These photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show the mansion needs refurbishing since it was last updated in the 1990s. The lower ground floor includes a study, a gym and massage room, three service rooms and a small garden and there is an underground garage where David can keep his fleet of cars. David and Victoria reportedly sold their Hertfordshire home, known as Beckingham Palace, for \u00a312million. However, they also own homes in California, Dubai and a \u00a32.6million holiday home in the South of France. The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate just three months after their wedding in 1999 for \u00a32.5million. They submitted a fresh application for air-conditioning in February, with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council expected to make a decision on it in the next three weeks. The Beckhams will also be installing underfloor heating at the home. Photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show it needs redecorating.

{"abstract": "France has approved a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die, bringing the country one step closer to legalising euthanasia.

The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate.", "article": "France is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die. The bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide, but would give people 'the right to deep, continuous sedation until death'. This must be at the patient's request, but only when their condition is life-threatening in the short-term. Protests: Demonstrators gather near the French National Assembly holding white silhouettes as part of a silent protest against euthanasia in Paris on March 10. Slogans read: 'Let's relieve but do not kill' On March 10. pro-euthanasia demonstrators held signs reading: 'Francois let's act like Holland'. Euthanasia has been taking place in Holland for many years. The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate. Backed by the Socialist government, the bill would also force doctors in France to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves, or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes. Almost one in 20 people in northern Belgium died using euthanasia in 2013, more than doubling the numbers in six years, a study released today showed. The universities of Ghent and Brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002, the acceptance of ending a life at the patient's request has greatly increased. While a 2007 survey showed 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in the region, the figure was 4.6 percent in 2013. 'Euthanasia has been increasingly accepted by the patients as a valid option at the end of their life,' said Ghent University ethics professor Freddy Mortier. 'Physicians themselves are more inclined to comply with the wishes of the patients.\" Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Earlier this month in a speech at France's lower house of Parliament, Prime minister Manuel Valls praised 'a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully, in dignity and without suffering'. The bill has stirred debate in France and prompted a call for the preservation of 'the prohibition of killing' by five high-profile Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. It has prompted protests by those claiming the bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, as well as pro-euthanasia campaigners who believe it does not go far enough. Doctors are also divided about the idea. So-called terminal or 'palliative sedation' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses, or until they starve. The method does not actively kill patients, but some doctors say it can mean patients are sedated for weeks before they die, and that it may be more humane to euthanise. French debate over end-of-life legislation resurfaced last year over the case of comatose Frenchman Vincent Lambert. His wife wants doctors to stop life support but his parents disagree. The case is pending at the European Court of Human Rights. Some protesters claim the new bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, while others say it doesn't go far enough.", "candidates": [["A bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die has been approved by France's lower house of Parliament, bringing the country one step closer to legalising euthanasia.

Jean and Joy Taylor were born in the house in Ryde, Isle of Wight, in 1916 and 1922, never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until Jean's death in 2008. Now their quiet, old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer Zoe Barker, with her picture series, The House Of Two Sisters. Scroll down for video. The sisters' guest room is decorated with pink candlewick bedspreads, an electric fire and family pictures on the mantelpiece. Jean's picture is in the centre, to  the right is their brother Jim in his Royal Artillery Uniform. The new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a 'cool cupbord' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese, butter and eggs. Jean Taylor (left) was born, lived and died in her home in Ryde, Isle of Wight; after the loss of her sister in 2008,  Joy, now 99, (right) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home. Barker's pictures are as much a document of the sisters' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing Britain. Her images  record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs, tins of treacle in the kitchen, a dressing table and highly-patterned carpets. There are no computers cluttering up surfaces, or plugs, wires and cables wending around furniture  and only a few black and white photographs  decorate on the walls. The women were born into a well-known local family, which originally set up a successful coaching business in the town in the 1840s. They also had two brothers James and John. Barker said: 'Very much a family home in the early days, the sisters shared the house with their mother and their Aunt Edie until both mother and aunt passed away. This was Jean's home all her life.' Aged 23 and 17 respectively when the Second World War broke out, the Taylor sisters came of age in an era of thrift, rationing and self-sacrifice.\u00a0And their wartime experiences are evident throughout the house. The  dressing table in the twin bedroom that Jean and Joy shared. Their beds are seen reflected in the mirror. The new owners have kept the old Electrolux hoover along with the carpet that remains in this room. Jean and Joy shared a bedroom from the 1950s until Jean's death. The  picture on the wall is of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who was never found after bailing out over the sea near Dunkirk. Both of their brothers survived the war and there is a picture of James, who served in North Africa and Italy while John fought in the jungles of Burma, on the guest bedroom mantelpiece. In their neat, almost spartan, room is a black and white photo of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who victory-rolled over the house whenever he flew over the island. On 4 June, 1941, he was seen to bail out over the sea near Dunkirk but was never found. The smaller photograph in the corner of the same frame is Bill Tudhope, a bomber pilot who was engaged to one of their cousins. He failed to return from a bombing mission over Germany in 1940. Barker said: 'In 1957 Joy left to live in London, though returned to the house almost every weekend. On retiring in 1981 she returned to live with her sister and they remained there together until Jean's death. 'Neither of them ever married. Despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until Jean passed away.' These plastic flowers were given to the sisters by the grandmother of the woman who delivered their lunches in the last two years of Jean's life. Niece Gill remembers how impractical these armchair 'tables' were andmugs of tea would slip off unless held on to tightly. Joy Taylor sold the house in 2013 but her coat still hangs on the coat rack along with the sisters' canes (left); the women hung their Sunday best dresses on the back of the bedroom door (right). Their niece Gill, who says her aunts were always smart dressers, remembers Jean wearing this two-piece on warm summer days. The Isle of Wight-based photographer was asked to take her camera around the house  by the new owners after Joy - the last of the Taylor family in Ryde - sold her house in 2013 to move into a care home. She said:\u00a0'The new owners are lovely - a middle-aged couple with a teenage daughter. They are all massive appreciators of old things so it couldn't be in better hands.

{"abstract": "Documents reveal that Margaret Thatcher ordered testing of a secret 'death ray' laser during the Falklands War, which was developed by Britain and America during the 1970s and 1980s. The laser was designed to target low flying aircraft by 'dazzling' pilots targeting ships, and was never used in action. The existence of the laser was revealed in a letter marked 'top secret' from the then Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine to Lady Thatcher in 1983 about the weapons owned by the Soviets and Britain's position.", "article": "Margaret Thatcher is said to have ordered testing of a laser to be used in the Falklands War. A secret 'death ray' laser was developed during the Falklands War and ordered for testing by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, documents reveal. Britain was said to have worked with America to develop the high powered lasers for use on the battlefield during the 1970s and 1980s. The beam, nicknamed a 'death ray', had been developed quickly because of fears over the weapons possessed by the Soviets - but was never used. But Lady Thatcher was said to be so impressed with the technology she ordered testing to take place during the Falklands War, the Daily Express reported. Existence of the laser was revealed in the National Archives, in a letter - marked 'top secret' from the then Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine to Lady Thatcher in 1983 about the weapons owned by the Soviets and Britain's position. It said: 'You may recall that we developed and deployed with great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low-flying Argentinian pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic. 'The weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted circle.' The letter was revealed under the 30 year rule. Sheffield academic Dr David Clarke found the letter in his search of the archives and said the 'naval laser weapon' referred to a device tested, but never used in anger, when troops were defending the Suez Canal in 1941. Margaret Thatcher (pictured front, centre) visited HMS Hermes when it came back from the Falklands War. This device used powerful searchlights to dazzle pilots as they attacked Royal Navy ships. In 1982, when the Falkland Islands was invaded, it was decided to use the same tactics to try and blind enemy pilots. In the 1980s Britain was said to be focused on developing\u00a0medium power lasers directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes, optic and electro-optic sensors. These weapons was designed to target low flying aircraft by 'dazzling' pilots targeting ships. The 'death ray' was said to be unlikely to be unsuccessful in targeting ships but would work on humans. Britain's laser weapon research in the 1980s was covered by two programmes - known as Raker and Shingle. According to the correspondence from Mr Heseltine, Britain had been working with America on developing laser weapons since the 1970s. Mr Heseltine also detailed fears in his letter to Lady Thatcher about the Soviets were developing a range of secret beam weapons. However he said he was uncertain whether owning these weapons was useful. In the letter he added:\u00a0'the Russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid-1980s (in fact, the Russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser Kirov)'.

The Government provides them with a loan \u2013 which is initially interest-free \u2013 to make up the rest of the down payment. Around 45,000 buyers have benefited from the scheme so far. The new Isa is the latest attempt by the Government to help first-time buyers. The accounts will work like a traditional Isa, with interest paid out by banks and building societies tax-free. They will be available to new account-holders for four years \u2013 but once opened there is no limit on how long someone can save for. Savers can make an initial deposit of \u00a31,000 when they open the Isa, but after this can only pay in a maximum of \u00a3200 a month. A \u00a350 bonus is then added by the Treasury.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Ms Gibson claimed her son's childcare details, her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce  backlash against her. She said that was the reason 'police came to our home checking in on my safety' last week. Ms Gibson also hit out at some of her critics, saying that while she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion', some people had responded'maliciously'. Belle Gibson: Doubt has been cast on the Whole Pantry founder's stories as people demand answers from the health guru. Doting young mum: Ms Gibson has expressed concern about her family's safety after her son's childcare details were allegedly placed online. Ms Gibson's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. The Instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis, saying she would 'have a statement live this week' where she would address medical questions. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. 'I do think it's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone's anger and confusion surrounding this last week, though this doesn't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously.' She has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication. Her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name, which is set to feature on the Apple Watch. The app gained popularity after Ms Gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life. But after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims, Ms Gibson herself admitted in an interview with The Australian that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver, spleen, blood and uterus was a'misdiagnosis'. Ms Gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her Instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the Whole Pantry Facebook page deleted. 'At the end of the day, I am a human being on the receiving end of comments, questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me, it does not warrant some of the recent responses,' she said. The Whole Pantry was voted Apple\u2019s Best Food and Drink App of 2013 and will feature on the Apple Watch. The technology giant did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Tuesday. She said the social media accounts were 'further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data, information or other security-sensitive content to be shared or made light of. 'My son's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this, so I'm sure you can understand how unnecessary, concerning and threatening that is.' Ms Gibson said the statement she was writing was taking 'longer than anticipated' because of media requests and 'constantly arising issues', 'with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son'. Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they visited an Elwood home last Tuesday evening 'as part of a welfare check.\u00a0They left shortly after with nil concerns.' Some of Ms Gibson's former followers have taken to social media to try to 'expose' her - posting images of her drinking alcohol before she became a clean-living star and old claims about her battle with cancer. The  Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page has been sharing images of her sipping beer. Clean-living Belle Gibson, seen here with a pint in her hand, told the friends who have spoken out about her to'make yourself invisible to me, and my life' The administrators of the Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page, which has been sharing images of her sipping beer and champagne and eating vegan doughnuts, said they are doing so because Ms Gibson 'fiercely censors\u00a0The Whole Pantry Facebook page'. 'The reason is simple, to educate and inform the many people who have already commented on this page feeling betrayed, deceived and let down by someone who they trusted,' they wrote.

The home improvement chain  is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Shares in Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Changes: B&Q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Parent company Kingfisher, which also owns Screwfix, plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360-strong B&Q estate. The move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to \u00a3675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to \u00a311billion in the year to January 31. This is down from 744million in the 2013-14 year. The planned store closures form part of a plan by new Chief Executive Veronique Laury to shake-up the 360-store B&Q business. Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds  in the year to January 31.The results are the first to be presented by Laury, who succeeded Ian Cheshire in December. Veronique Laury said the closure plan was one of a number of'sharp' decisions being taken by the FTSE 100 company. She added: 'Home improvement is a great market with huge potential and Kingfisher has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way. However, it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential.' Other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company, particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of Kingfisher's operating companies. The company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities. Kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the B&Q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the Screwfix brand, while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business. Ms Laury denied that the UK DIY market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company's UK offer. She added that it had long been clear that B&Q had too many stores in its estate. B&Q UK & Ireland's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to \u00a33.7 billion in the financial year, with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent. Profits were 16 per cent higher at \u00a3276million. In contrast, profits in France were 12 per cent lower at \u00a3349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market. Kingfisher said it will close a small number of stores in the country. It came as Kingfisher, which had a binding agreement to buy French rival Mr Bricolage, was forced to pull out of the \u00a3200m deal. The acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because Kingfisher already owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. While it had the backing of a key shareholder, support was withdrawn by franchisee group the Association Nationale des Promoteurs du Faites Le Vous-M\u00eame (ANPF), which holds a 42pc stake in Mr Bricolage. Forty-four of Mr Bricolage's 500 stores, many of them franchises, would had to have been sold to placate regulators. It has since emerged that today was the deadline for the deal and all parties had to agree if there was an extension.", "candidates": [["B&Q, the home improvement chain, is to close up to 60 of its 360 stores in the UK and Ireland over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its business.

Camera assistant Sarah Jones (above) was struck by a fuel tank and run over by the train as she tried to flee and was killed instantly. The film's director Randall Miller (above with wife Jody Savin) pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and will serve two years in prison. The video also shows the crew desperately trying to get a bed off the track, which Hurt was laying on during the scene as they filmed a dream sequence while Russell played the guitar. Russell, the son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, can be seen clearly in the video as he flees with a guitar still on his back. Footage taken just before the tragic incident unfolded was later edited and cut into a scene. It would have been used in the film if production hadn't been stopped. Two weeks ago, the film's director, Randall Miller, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and will serve two years in a county jail and eight years probation while also paying a $20,000 fine. Executive producer Jay Sedrish also pleaded guilty to the same charges and received 10 years probation. 'We hope the sacrifice of our daughter's life will continue to change the film industry,' Jones' father, Richard Jones, told reporters outside the courthouse. 'I believe it sends a message, frankly, that if you do not respect those you're in charge of, you may end up behind bars.' In addition,\u00a0Hillary Schwartz, an assistant director on the film, was also convicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and also received 10 years probation. Charges against Miller's wife and business partner, Jody Savin, were dropped as part of his plea. Prosecutors said all three defendants knew that CSX Transportation, which owned the trestle spanning the Altamaha River, had denied them permission in writing to film on its tracks. 'It was a horrible tragedy that will haunt me forever,' Miller said in a statement provided by a publicist. 'Although I relied on my team, it is ultimately my responsibility and was my decision to shoot the scripted scene that caused this tragedy.' Hurt (above) won the Best Actor Oscar in 1986 for Kiss of the Spider Woman. Assistant District Attorney John B. Johnson said Miller and the other filmmakers even attempted to rewrite the script to drop the scene they planned to shoot with actor William Hurt, in the role of Allman, in a hospital bed placed on the tracks. Miller decided to shoot the scene anyway, Johnson said, after the owner of the property surrounding the tracks said the movie crew could access its land. He said Miller and his crew went onto the railroad bridge after mistakenly thinking no more trains would pass that day. The train, traveling at 55mph, smashed into a metal-framed bed on the tracks, sending shrapnel flying as crew members scrambled for safety and clung to the bridge's metal railing high above the Altamaha River. After his plea was accepted, Miller followed a sheriff's deputy from the courtroom to begin his two-year sentence at the Wayne County jail. He also agreed to serve an additional eight years on probation and pay a $20,000 fine. Miller's attorney, Ed Garland, said he expects the director could be released from jail within a year. He said Miller accepted the plea deal to prevent prosecution of his wife, who left the courthouse in tears. Garland said the filmmaker never intended to put his crew at risk. The crew was filming a dream sequence that featured Hurt, as Allman, on a bed (above) Russell (above) was playing a guitar in the scene, and can be seen carrying it still as he ran from the train.

Together, Asian and Formosan subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. The Formosan termites originated in China but now are established throughout the Southeast and blamed for roughly $300m in property damage each year in New Orleans alone. Asian termites normally found in tropical south-eastern Asia have spread to Brazil, the Caribbean and south Florida. Asian termites are not expected to spread farther north in the US than south Florida because they do not tolerate colder weather/. However, a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone. Their habitat ranges overlap in lush south Florida, already home to a daunting number of invasive plant and animal species thriving where they should not. Each termite invaded Florida several decades ago, but experts believed the colonies didn't mingle because their above ground mating swarms launched in different months. That is, until University of Florida researcher Thomas Chouvenc noticed something unusual about the termite swarms in his Fort Lauderdale neighbourhood two years ago. The two species were flying around looking for mates at the same time \u2013 and they were giving each other that look. The research is preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered, but the idea of a hybrid termite carrying the destructive capabilities of two invasive species worries experts. 'That's big news,' said Matthew Messenger, an entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture. 'They're two bad ones, too.' Chouvenc is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal Plos One detailing observations of Asian and Formosan termite swarms in downtown Fort Lauderdale. In the field, including Chouvenc's own yard, researchers documented the two species swarming at the same time and in the same places. The same behaviour was documented again last year, and Chouvenc said he is seeing again this spring. 'What we didn't expect to see was when they're in the same place at the same time, we saw the male Asian subterranean termites looking for the female Formosan termites in the field,' Chouvenc said. Together, Asian and Formosan (pictured) subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. 'When we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab, to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing.' The resulting 'hybrid' colony in the lab grew more vigorously than colonies produced by either species alone, researchers said. Genetic analysis confirmed they were looking at a hybrid species. Similar hybridisation has been documented in invasive bee and fire ant species, but not in termites. The two termite species also are found together on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and in Taiwan, but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in Florida appear to be a new phenomenon. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale, or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale in the south of Florida. Female termites can lay millions of eggs, but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms. 'Let's keep our fingers crossed that they're not able [to reproduce] and that they're donkey termites,' said Messenger, who reviewed the data but did not participate in the University of Florida study. Even if hybrid termites cannot reproduce, they could cause damage over many years. Alone, each species is a challenge to control. Their below-ground colonies are bigger than those of native termites and can be hard to find. Liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against Asian and Formosan termites, and those methods should work against any hybrid, Messenger said.

But in later decades as women swelled the workforce, convenient pre-prepared sandwiches, microwaves and ready meals transformed Britain's kitchens - and its diet. Scroll down for video.

Thanks to households being rationed to one egg per week, cakes like this one, right, had to be made with dried eggs, left, while they were topped with blancmange thanks to the lack of sugar available. The Robshaw family try making a Fifties cake with limited ingredients on BBC show 'Back in Time for Dinner', ably assisted by Mary Berry. She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'We have this idea of the Fifties being a domestic ideal - Mad Men, glamorous - \u00a0this was not the case in Britain, we were still in rationing, very austere. 'It meant there was only one fresh egg a week per household so housewives had to feed the family with these limited rations. 'It's not surprising housewives became fed-up in the Fifties - they spent 75 hours a week doing housework.' 'They had to cope with powdered eggs and a limited amount of variety to cook with.' A new BBC series called\u00a0Back In Time For Dinner challenged a modern family to try reliving what this was like. The Robshaws - father Brandon, mother Rochelle and children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15, and Fred 10 - learnt that rations certainly made birthdays less indulgent. Food historian Dr Polly Russell, pictured, took Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on a trip down memory lane for the taste buds on today's This Morning, showing what was typically eaten from the Fifties to Nineties. The Robshaw family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the Fifties to the Nineties. Pictured, from left to right, Rosalind, 15, mum Rochelle, Fred, 10, dad Brandon and Miranda, 17, in the Fifties episode. Dr Russell invited Amanda and Phillip to try a birthday cake the family made on the show based on a Fifties recipe. She explained: 'A cake had to be made with dry eggs and icing with a blancmange topping because of the lack of sugar.\u00a0' After a taste test, Amanda admitted it was 'dry but not inedible'. Bread and dripping (often leftover fat from the Sunday roast) was a common reality at breakfast time while fresh vegetables were often taken from community allotments. In the Sixties, This Morning illustrated how a typical food spread would include cheese and pineapples on cocktails sticks and corned beef. Dr Russell revealed how this was the decade when kitchens were transformed by technology. She said: 'In the Sixties there was a real rise in disposable incomes and an increase technology in the kitchen. In the Sixties, food became more colourful and decorative, as shown by the cheese and pineapple sticks served on an orange and vibrant table cloth on today's This Morning. The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties. 'The most iconic piece is the fridge but only 50 per cent of households had one by the end of the decade, everyone else used larders. The fridge changed what you could cook.' The food historian added that food at this time became'more about display and what it looks like as well as what it tastes like.' So along with the decorative pineapple and cheese on sticks served attached to an orange, came colourful dishes like vegetable terrines. By the Seventies,\u00a040 per cent of women were working, leading to a rise in the number of convenience foods on offer. Dr Russell explained: 'Now women have less time for cooking so the food industry starts offering help in terms of processed, convenience foods so there are things like Pot Noodles available. 'There's also more branding and colourful packaging to try and persuade people to buy them.' By the Seventies, with more women going out to work, food is becoming more convenient with products like Angel Delight, back left, and ready-made cake mixtures, back right. Arctic rolls and Pot Noodles became popular in the Seventies as people spent less time cooking.

The Guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005. Charles is next in line to the British throne and as King would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality. Some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a \"meddling king,\" attempting to influence politicians. After the judgment was released Thursday, Guardian Editor-in-Chief Alan Rusbridger said the paper was \"delighted\" about the Supreme Court's decision after what he said was a \"brilliant 10-year campaign by Guardian reporter Rob Evans.\" \"The government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters, admitting their publication would'seriously damage' perceptions of the Prince's political neutrality. Now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment,\" Rusbridger said. Max Foster, CNN's royal correspondent, says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne. \"These were private letters, never meant for public consumption, which is why the Prince's office has resisted their release,\" he said. \"But they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy. Should Charles be getting involved in politics at all when, as head of state, he'll be expected to be politically neutral? He's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the judgment was \"disappointing\" and the government would now look at how to release the letters. \"This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough,\" he said. Cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision: \"Our FOI (freedom of information) laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto, which we exercised in this case for a reason. If the legislation does not make Parliament's intentions for the veto clear enough, then we will need to make it clearer.\" The Prince's official residence, Clarence House, issued a brief statement about the decision. \"This is a matter for the government. Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.\" The anti-monarchy group Republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the Freedom of Information Act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk. \"The government must now act to end royal secrecy. Any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret,\" CEO Graham Smith said. \"We can't have a situation where we don't know what influence Charles is having on government policy.\" In a statement issued on the eve of the decision, Smith branded the monarchy one of Britain's \"most secretive institutions.\" \"Charles clearly has his own political agenda, yet his name won't be on the ballot in May. So we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy.\" Evans, the Guardian reporter, had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between Charles and various government departments under the UK's Freedom of Information Act and environmental regulations. After the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests, Evans appealed to the Information Tribunal, which referred the matter to the Upper Tribunal. The Guardian reported in 2009 that Charles had written to Treasury, Foreign Office and Education Department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials. \"The disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king,\" the paper said. The Upper Tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters, \"advocacy correspondence,\" should be disclosed, but its decision was vetoed by Britain's attorney general, who issued a certificate overriding it. Explaining his decision, the attorney general said that in that his view, the correspondence was \"undertaken as part of The Prince of Wales' preparation for becoming King\" and contained nothing that outweighed \"strong public interest against disclosure.\" The Guardian challenged the veto in court, but three high court judges dismissed it, so Evans appealed to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate.", "candidates": [["UK's Prince Charles' previously secret correspondence between him and government officials is to be made public after a Supreme Court ruling.

Shocking pictures showed the angry mob of 2,000 people after they broke into a prison, kidnapped the man, stripped him naked and mercilessly beat him to death in front of a frenzied crowd. The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college on February 24, and he was arrested a day later. Now the alleged rape survivor has spoken out, accusing the lynched man of giving her \u00a350 to not tell anyone about the attack. Scroll down for video. Furious: Several thousand people gathered as the man (pictured, top) accused of raping a girl last month was mercilessly beaten to death. Lynched: The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death. It is unclear whether he is dead in this shocking image. Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later. Offer: The woman says that the man offered her \u00a350 to keep quiet about the alleged attack. Speaking anonymously to a local TV station, the woman said:\u00a0'The accused person was my neighbour. 'It was only after the incident...he told me,\u00a0he gave me the money to keep silent...I took the money and gave it at the police station.' The pictures showed the mob after they overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man. According to local media reports, he died while being dragged four miles through the streets as people beat and pelted him with stones. It was reported that the crowd tore down two gates before dragging him to the town's clock tower. It was said they also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Several people were injured when police used batons and opened fire, while officers were hurt when the mob pelted them with stones in Nagaland state in northeast India. A 25-year-old believed to be part of the mob was injured when police opened fire and he later died in hospital. The police later removed the man's body. Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express. Protesters: A mass rally was held in Dimapur by those who oppose the rape of a student last month. But the family of the lynched man have maintained his innocence and say the medical report of the rape complainant proves that she was not sexually assaulted. The man has been named by Indian media as Syed Sarif Uddin Khan and his brother Jamal said the killing was 'politically motivated' and accused police of 'falsely implicating his brother on behest of Naga groups, who want to root out non-tribals from the state'. Nagaland's indigenous tribal groups, especially the largest Naga tribe, have for years accused the growing population of Bengali-speaking Muslims from nearby Assam state and Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and usurping resources. Nagas have previously campaigned to evict Bengali-speaking immigrants from their territory, who they claim entice local girls into marriage for getting tribal status. Jamaluddin, an Indian army sergeant, accused Nagaland's government of 'deliberately dubbing him as a Bangladeshi... to justify the killing'. 'The girl's medical report didn't confirm rape but still my brother was jailed and then handed over to the mob who lynched him just because he was a Bengali-speaking person. 'There are multiple members of our family serving in the Army. How could they have killed him claiming he was Bangladeshi? My brother was made a scapegoat.' Police had initially claimed that the man was an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant. 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it. India is in midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student. The incident, which sparked outrage both in India and around the world, highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the country. The Indian government has also asked YouTube to block access to the documentary, claiming that its broadcast violated certain key agreements with the filmmaker. But the Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch the documentary, which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. The documentary, called 'India's Daughter', was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack.

{"abstract": "Saudi Arabia and its allies launched airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, with the possibility of sending ground troops, in an effort to prevent the Houthis from taking over the country and creating another Shiite-dominated state in the region. The coalition of countries involved in the airstrikes are predominantly Sunni Muslim, while the Houthis are Shiite Muslims. The United States is not involved in the airstrikes, but is supporting the coalition through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance, and logistical support.", "article": "(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,\" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said \"there will be no military intervention by the U.S.\" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, \"If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us.\" He added, \"We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner.\" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. \"This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,\" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called \"the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \"We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue (that includes) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis,\" the Iraqi ministry said. The Houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in Yemen. In addition to airstrikes, the Saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in Yemen. Just a day in, the coalition airstrikes are already costing the Houthis. Hundreds of explosions ripped through Sanaa overnight, said journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital. The Health Ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in Sanaa, the Houthi-run Saba news agency said. While Sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the Houthis' combat and control operations there, the Saudi adviser said -- it wasn't the only place struck. Compounds and military installations in Saada and Taiz also were targeted. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. The military operation, dubbed al-Hazm Storm, was launched after the Houthis rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said in a speech Thursday. It was done in accord with a joint Arab defense treaty, al-Arabi said. Specifically, the strikes aim to support Hadi, who was ousted in January after talks with the Houthis faltered, but still claims to be Yemen's rightful leader. \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, in announcing the beginning of the military campaign. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be an option for us or for our coalition partners.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen?

Twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately England finished six points adrift of the total they needed as Ireland claimed the title for the second season running.

It was always going to be a huge ask against a French side that, for all its faults, had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this Twickenham clash. Suddenly, the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around England's throat. Lancaster had recalled experienced Leicester lock Geoff Parling in place of Dave Attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against Scotland last Saturday.

The suspect  -- a suspected bank robber -- was killed. Casper had successfully completely his field training recently. He was on his first solo assignment, Capt. Anthony Burrell told reporters Wednesday. It's unclear whether the suspects were fatally shot by law enforcement officers or died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Johnson, a veteran, was killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. Part of his job was to work with new officers. Police received a call Tuesday evening about a \"despondent, intoxicated man, who possibly had access to a weapon, including a rifle,\" said San Jose police Chief Larry Esquivel. When officers arrived at the scene, they were met with gunfire, said Esquivel, adding that investigators were still trying \"to understand what truly happened.\" Johnson was the first San Jose officer killed in the line of duty in 14 years.

He had been sworn in as a state trooper in December, according to media reports and a Facebook page dedicated to his memory. \"Trevor Casper was a lively young man,\" Burrell recalled. \"He was very excited about his opportunity to be a trooper... He always had a smile on his face. When we met several times, I always asked if he was having fun and his response was, 'I sure am,' with a smile on his face.\" Gunfire rang out when the trooper was pursuing a car that matched the description of one used in a bank robbery, CNN affiliate WITI-TV in Milwaukee reported.

A bookkeeper stole almost \u00a32million from his employers and used some of the money to buy a plot of land in Scotland - complete with an aristocratic title. Julian Kremer, 49, admitted fiddling the books at the estate agency he worked for in Wokingham, Berkshire, and used most of the cash to fund an internet gambling habit, a court heard. Five members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents were made redundant due to the losses while the company fell into financial ruin. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get'. Prosecutor Jane Davies told the court Kremer's crimes came to light on January 31, 2013, after the salaries of two employees had not been paid. She said: 'Steven Jones, the company director, made inquiries about the balances in five of the company accounts because it was believed the balances were not as they should have been.' The court heard he had altered the figures on at least two of the accounts to an inflated sum to make them look higher than they were. He was confronted by staff and admitted taking \u00a31.9 million over a four and a half year period, from July 2008 to January 2013, and spent more than \u00a3630,000 on gambling. Mr Recorder Martin Heslop QC said: 'One of the gambling companies described him as their best customer.' Credit card bills showed payments exceeding \u00a34,000 a month and some of the cash was spent on hotels. He also bought a small plot of land in Scotland which meant he could use the title Laird Julian Kremer and he asked for his personal details to be altered to reflect the name change. Company director, Steven Jones, who runs the company under the names Richard Worth Ltd, Richard Worth Residential Ltd and Richard Worth Holdings Ltd, told the court he had known Kremer for almost 20 years. Miss Davies said: 'Kremer stole around \u00a3250,000 a year and told Mr Jones cash flow was not improving due to debts. 'After the discovery, Mr Jones did everything he could to minimise financial ruin for the company. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court (pictured) on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get' 'He had to borrow \u00a3250,000 personally and made redundant five members of staff. He took on a \u00a31million debt which will take many years to repay. 'The business was the bedrock of his retirement planning and he doubts he will ever recover from the financial disaster.' Defending, Llewellyn Sellick said Mr Jones had sold the letting limb of the business and the other was still trading. He told the court: 'He is of hitherto good character, he accepts this involves a very large sum. He made an immediate confession to his employers and he repeated this when he was arrested. 'He now has nothing. He was heavily addicted to gambling and had to sell his \u00a3400,000 house. 'By the 1990s, he had lost three of his grandparents and his mother's brother. His brother Simon was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2004 aged 41.' Kremer separated from his wife in 2007 and has been in a civil marriage with his now husband since 2011. Mr Sellick said: 'He knows he has to be punished. I ask that you impose a sentence that will not crush him entirely.' The court heard Kremer, formerly from Wokingham, and now living in Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to one count of theft from an employer in January. Kremer admitted altering figures to make them look higher than they were and his crimes only came to light after there was not enough money to pay two members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents in Wokingham. Jailing him for five years, Mr Recorder Heslop said: 'This case paints a sad picture of a man of previous good character. 'There are severe financial and personal consequences for those who suffered as a result of this theft. A suspended prison sentence is, I am afraid, wholly inappropriate. 'This was a professional, sophisticated and at times extremely clever and deliberate theft involving fraud, forgery and misrepresentation to those for whom you worked and it is a theft on a very significant scale carried out over a substantial period of time. 'The total sum is \u00a31,981,936 and this is as bad a case as one could imagine. It is quite clear the money went on gambling. 'There is also evidence of high living.

The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. But the amount was revealed in legal documents filed last month in Westchester Surrogate's Court. Denita, 19, wrote in an affidavit included in the filing that 'no amount of money could replace' her father, but that the settlement 'greatly exceeds anything I imagined and I could not be more grateful.' When the settlement was first announced in January, Zaslow said Walmart had 'accepted their responsibility' in the crash. 'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' he said. 'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.' He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.' James McNair was killed when the limo van he was traveling in was struck by an 18-wheeler on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7. Zaslow wrote that he was 'able to convince Wal-Mart' that the hefty settlement would outweigh potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicizing lawsuit. The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the superstore to admit no liability for the crash. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident. 'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.' Kevin Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey. The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash. In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash. Morgan, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash, has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart.

Judge Anthony Russell QC told Taylor: 'The victim was someone completely unknown to you and had done you absolutely no harm at all and yet was murdered by you for no other reason other than he happened to be the person at the home of Jody Emery. 'This was a particularly shocking murder because it was pure chance Adam Wilson was the person who you vented your rage on because you were unable to accept your relationship with Jody Emery was finished. 'People have to accept that sometimes things go wrong in their lives and relationship do sometimes end. You were not prepared to accept that. Taylor kicked down Miss Emery's front door on September 22 last year, and began fighting with Mr WIlson (pictured), fatally stabbing him in the thigh. 'You persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance. 'You were not prepared to let her move along with her life or yours because of your obsessive jealousy. She was perfectly entitled to see other people, it was none of your business if she did so. 'You murdered this man for no other reason other than he was in a place he was perfectly entitled to be. He had done no wrong.' The court earlier heard that Taylor, a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses, had been in an eight-month relationship with Miss Emery. The pair had shared a caravan holiday together in Scarborough, but after they returned home Miss Emery secretly terminated a pregnancy. When Taylor found out he flew into a rage and the pair split. Unable to accept the break-up Taylor began texting and calling Miss Emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together, and often went to her house to watch her, often coming up to look through the windows. Two days before the murder took place Taylor was at pub\u00a0the Tardy Gate. When he spotted one of Miss Emery's former boyfriends he became angry, smashed a window and tried to punch the man. Louise Blackwell QC said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery saying: 'I miss you. Maybe in time you'll want to try again'. She asked him not to contact her but later that evening he sent her another text saying: 'Can I come for cuddles?' Miss Emery responded, 'you being weird then', to which he said: 'I'm not my head is just f..ked' and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during his holiday with Miss Emery. The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with. She texted back, 'on my own I keep telling you' at which point Taylor said: 'last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance'. Emery replied 'wtf' and tried to call him three times with no response. Miss Blackwell added: 'The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. 'Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge. 'Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop.

Experts say donor organs are declining in quality with more now coming from the elderly or those damaged by lifestyle. The NHS is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants. Doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims, drug addicts, and those with infections under new plans (file picture) And one of the plans reportedly been considered is offering patients transplants using organs from people who would have usually had them rejected after being deemed to 'high-risk'. According to the Sunday Times, the proposals would create a special 'fast track' waiting list for the high risk organs. Dr Titus Augustine, director of transplantation at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told the newspaper: 'One of the things that we have been looking at is trying to match risk with risk. 'There are people on the lost who are willing to take that risk, accept kidneys from people with known infection risk or cancer risk.' Organs are deemed high risk if they come from cancer patients, intravenous drug users and those with a history of having high-risk sex lives. However, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust have said they rejected a research proposal looking into high-risk organ donation. A spokesperson said: 'The Trust submits hundreds of research proposals and applications for funding every year. 'This was an application for funding for a research project looking in to offering patients at risk of dying without transplantation organs considered high risk. 'This proposal was rejected by the funding body and therefore will not be progressing any further.' Darren Hughes, 42, left, and Robert Stuart, 67, right, both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis-causing parasitic worms. Last year, it emerged that at least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved \u2018high-risk\u2019 organs that could be damaged or infected. Figures obtained from NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority which oversees donations, show that last year, 333 patients were given high-risk organs. This represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts, cancer sufferers or those aged over 71. The 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers, the obese or the very sexually active who may have HIV or other infections. But Bryon Jaques, who worked for Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals before emigrating to Australia, warned the NHS drive to increase donations was flawed. It comes after it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm. The relatives of Darren Hughes, 42, and grandfather Robert Stuart, 67, say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) in 2013 and died within three weeks. The organs belonged to a 39-year-old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in England and Scotland before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Birmingham and Edinburgh from accepting his kidneys. Mr Jaques, who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist, said: \u2018We were regularly offered donors that I considered to be very high risk. We were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis (blood infection). \u2018I was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer, which has a high risk of transmission. \u2018We were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure. The vast majority of transplants that do take place in the UK are successful and that\u2019s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community. Last year \u2013 2013/2014 \u2013 there were 4,655 transplants, an increase of 10 per cent on the year before.", "candidates": [["NHSN is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants.

Casciaro's brothers, Kyle and Ryan, also play for the national team.", "article": "As the scorer of Gibraltar\u2019s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night. However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium. If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane\u2019s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip. Gibraltar's players celebrate after Lee Casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on Sunday. Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar\u2019s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye. His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden. For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida. Casciaro (centre) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in Gibraltar. \u2018It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,\u2019 he beamed. \u2018It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It\u2019s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar. \u2018I don\u2019t think I will get a hero\u2019s reception when I get home. We still lost the game \u2013 but it is still an achievement to get the goal. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba celebrates the goal at Hampden Park, which levelled the score at 1-1. \u2018We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we\u2019ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch. \u2018Even two or three years ago I didn\u2019t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn\u2019t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day. \u2018This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling. \u2018I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I\u2019m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.\u2019 Casciaro (right) vies for the ball with Scotland's Ikechi Anya, who he later swapped shirts with. Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan\u2019s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team. \u2018I would think we have shown that we are not,\u2019 he said. \u2018We are improving and we do try to play football, which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group. We try to create a good game for the spectators to watch.\u2019 Last June, the first-ever winning goal scored by the British overseas territory - with a 30,000-population comparable with Wishaw - was slotted home in a 1-0 friendly win over Malta in Portugal. That night the history-maker was Kyle Casciaro, Lee\u2019s brother, who was an unused substitute on Sunday. A third brother, Ryan, played in defence for Gibraltar at Hampden in front of proud parents Henry and Helen. Lee Casciaro's brother Ryan, who also plays for the national team, shares a joke with Steven Fletcher. \u2018I\u2019m keeping it in the family,\u2019 smiled Lee. \u2018My mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today. We have to go to Faro in Portugal to play our home games, but they have always been there for us. It is thanks to them that we are here. It is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level. I don\u2019t think that happens very often in the world of football to have three brothers in an international squad.\u2019 With the benefit of having played all the Group D teams now, Casciaro feels that Scotland and Ireland \u2013 who meet in Dublin in June - will be in a battle for third place behind Poland and Germany. \u2018Germany are the world champions and Poland are", "candidates": [["Hong Gibraltar's first-ever competitive goal was scored by Lee Casciaro, a Ministry of Defence policeman who has been training for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch.

The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced last night by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shiite militias to spare civilians. Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against the Tikrit area's mainly Sunni population. Scroll down for video. Attack: Volunteer Shiite fighters, who are supporting the Iraqi government forces in the fight against the Islamic State group fire a howitzer artillery canon in the village of Awaynat near the city of Tikrit. Irregulars: Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite fighters chant slogans as they gather at Udhaim dam, north of Baghdad, ahead of an advance on Islamic State positions Tikrit that is expected to begin today. Feeding the soul: Soldiers and irregulars take a moment to pray as Iraq masses its forces outside the city, which was the birthplace of Saddam Hussein and an important step on the road to the IS-held city of Mosul. Feeding the body: Fighters scoff their rations ahead of the attack. It is feared the mainly Shiite forces of the Iraqi government could attack the area's mainly Sunni population, worsening sectarian divisions. On social media, Mr Abadi called 'for utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property' in the city, which was last year the scene of a brutal massacre of hundreds of mainly Shiite Iraqi army recruits. Government forces have been working their way north in recent months, notching up key victories against IS. But Tikrit, which has resisted them several times, is their toughest target yet. 'Security forces are advancing on three main fronts towards Tikrit, Ad-Dawr (to the south) and Al-Alam (to the north),' a senior army officer on the ground told AFP by telephone. The army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army, police, counter-terrorism units, a government-controlled volunteer group known as the Popular Mobilisation units and local Sunni tribes opposed to IS. 'The attack is being carried out using fighter jets, helicopters and artillery targeting Tikrit to secure the advance and cut supply routes,' he said. Military sources said Iraqi warplanes were involved but it was not immediately clear whether foreign air support - Iranian or from the US-led coalition fighting IS - was also called in. According to both Iraqi and Iranian media, Qassem Suleimani - supremo of the elite Iranian Quds force, specialising in'subversive warfare' - was in Salaheddin province to help coordinate operations. Massing: Iraqi Army and volunteer fighters prepare at Sedull Udeyim region before moving into Tikrit. Good morale: Iraqi forces have notched up key victories against IS as they've inched north in recent weeks. Religion: A soldier walks past a line of armoured cars, one of which has a photo of a cleric in the window. Cavalry: Iraqi armoured personnel carriers are lined up ahead of the attack on Tikrit today. Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shiite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions. Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shiite majority. Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq. 'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night. Hadi al-Ameri, the Popular Mobilisation commander, appealed to Tikrit residents on Saturday to leave their homes within 48 hours so government forces could 'wrap up the battle of the revenge for Speicher.' Speicher is a military base near Tikrit from which hundreds of new, mostly Shiite, recruits were kidnapped before being executed last summer, as the Islamic State insurgency took control of much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland. Shiite militias in particular have vowed to avenge the Speicher executions, sparking fears of mass killings against Sunnis if Tikrit were to be recaptured. Mr Abadi appealed to residents to turn against the jihadists, who have suffered a string of military losses since a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations stepped up their support for Iraq's embattled government. 'I call on all those who were misled and made mistakes in the past to lay down their arms today. This may be the last chance,' Mr Abadi said, suggesting some could be granted amnesty.

Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the wall of a building. Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the tragedy unfolded at around 6.30pm. Passerby Ronald Luis said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming, so that\u2019s what really caught my attention. 'And when I looked back, that\u2019s when I saw the car drive onto the sidewalk.' Speaking to\u00a0ABC 7, the 18-year-old added: 'It was frantic, very scary, never seen anything like it.' Fatal: The man's green-colored taxi struck and killed Kadeem Brown and little Tierre Clark, who were part of a group of people waiting at a bus stop on the road (pictured). A  man, 55, and a woman, 36, were left injured.

Ronald Luis (pictured), who saw the tragedy occur at around 6.30pm, said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming' Emergency crews arrived at the bustling Grand Concourse, where they discovered Mr Brown and Miss Clark lying unresponsive on the ground. Mr Brown, who lived nearby, was pronounced dead. Witnesses watched in shock as medics desperately tried to revive the youngster by carrying out CPR on her small body and rushing her to hospital. But despite their best efforts, she shortly died. 'On this side they were pressing on her chest - the little girl. I\u2019m guessing also she couldn\u2019t breathe.

The shooter may have unsuccessfully asked Darrell Shriver, 68, for a job before killing him, his son Carey Shriver, 46, and Carey's wife, Valirea, 44, according to the elder victim's cousin John, 72. Nine people are dead in the tiny rural community - including Aldridge, who turned the gun on himself after the shooting spree that followed the death of his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill. Scroll down for video. Darrell Shriver, 68, of Tyrone, Missouri was shot in a Thursday night rampage along with his son Carey, (back center) 46, and Carey's wife Valirea, (right) 44. Above, the couple takes a vacation with their son and daughter. The shooter had asked Darrell Shriver, (right) 68, for a job but didn't get it, according to resident John Shriver, 72. Above, the victim and his wife Martha, (left) 67, who was wounded but expected to survive. Joe Alridge, 36, is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, as well as the Shrivers. Aldridge, who took his own life in his pickup truck on Friday morning, was described as a recluse by those in the town. It was known in the town that Aldridge's family and the Shrivers had been feuding for years, a resident of nearby Summersville told Daily Mail Online. The Shrivers were described as a hard-working clan that owned businesses including construction, cabinet making and cattle farming projects since 1969. Darrell Shriver's wife Martha, 67, was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. She is expected to survive. 'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' John Shriver said. The elder Shriver discovered the bodies of Carey and Valirea after getting a call to check on them from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star. The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his older, college-aged sister. He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'. The shooter is thought to have killed his cousin Garold Dee Aldridge, (center left) 52, and his wife\u00a0Julie Ann Aldridge, (right) 47. The motive for the gunman killing his cousin Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife\u00a0Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, is unknown. The Shrivers were described as a hardworking family that owned several businesses. Above, Carey and Valirea with their daughter. Martha Shriver (right) called John Shriver, 72, to check up on her son Carey before she and husband Darrell (left) were shot. Authorities identified the four other victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold. John Shriver was unsure about why the killer would target his own family members, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between the shooter and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to\u00a0Arkansas Online. The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot. 'She said she seen a man in her dad's bedroom, talking to him in a normal voice. Then she said she heard gunshots and screaming,' an unidentified neighbor said. 'She was barefoot, in a nightgown with no sleeves at all and her legs were all scratched up from briars, he told the\u00a0Springfield News Leader. The shooter had no trouble getting into his neighbor's homes. Armed with a.45-caliber handgun, Aldridge shot his seven victims before killing himself in his pickup truck in the middle of a highway on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, to the east of Texas County.

Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to Nantucket in their car, which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles. They can now navigate small towns and state highway systems without any help after they accumulated knowledge about how the country is set up, the couple told Daily Mail Online. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl, 32 and 31, completed their journey to the lower 48 states' 3,108 counties when they arrived in Nantucket, their last county, with their green 1999 Dodge Intrepid. They have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006, though the Riehls bought a GPS device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the US where the streets aren't labelled. Jennifer Riehl, 32, a research scientist at Michigan Technological University, and her husband, 31, an engineering instructor at the institution, typically drove about 50,000 miles a year. Jonathan, who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates, hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are 'genuinely baffled' by the accomplishment. Mr Riehl bought the car as a high school senior living in New Jersey for $9,000. At the time, 2002, it had 70,000 miles. The couple met in 2005 and have had their share of adventures since, including meeting a bear and running into nasty weather, according to\u00a0The Cape Cod Times. The car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties, and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16-hour days on the road. They think a 15,000-mile trip from New Jersey to Alaska to their home on Michigan's Upper Peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car. First counties visited by the couple, which met in upstate New York, include many Northeastern destinations where they visited friends. Jonathan, who works with geographical information science computer programs, saw that they had visited a fair number of counties together and during childhood road trips. A move to Nashville, Tennessee, for two years, sparked the idea that they could actually hit all the counties. The contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties, and the addition of Alaska and Hawaii brings the total to 3,143. The couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on Tuesday during their spring break trip. Above, pictured in Plymouth, Mass on Wednesday. The couple has already visited some boroughs of Alaska, but plans on finishing the state and starting on Hawaii. Jennifer's mother lives in Texas, but the travelers don't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit. They have spent days going to the southern state by route of California or Idaho, most recently picking up five counties they had missed in the Gem State during previous journeys. Their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. With academic schedules, the pair has gone to most of the thousands of counties during breaks from school, including winter holidays where they truck through snow. Jonathan proposed to Jennifer on a 2011 trip to Manitoba, Canada, where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three Mexican states. However, their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to Winnepeg in blinding snow with Jennifer keeping track of the road's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove. The couple often taken the long route to friends' and relatives' houses, going from Michigan to Texas via California or Idaho. The car, which Jonathan bought in 2002, still has the same engine. The couple avoids the interstate and uses small and dirt roads when possible. Above, Jennifer stands in Golden Valley County, Montana, in 2012. Oscar Voss of the nonprofit national Extra Miler Club, a travel group where the Riehls are members, says that the couple is likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car. The club lists 38 people who have 'bagged' all 3,143 counties in the entire US, the first being Ed Dietz and Arthur Palmer in 1976. Most of the people who have been to all the counties are over 60, according to the club's Valerie Naylor. The Riehls said that all members of the club go around the country with different goals, such as visiting national parks or climbing to the highest points. Jonathan and Jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can. Jonathan is particularly interested in architecture and Jennifer likes to hike all over the country. As a pair they have also visited motels in each of the 48 states but Delaware and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels, hearing stories from a variety of locals.

Not right: Critics of the 'feminine' sportswear line took to social media to air their grievances with the brand's impractical designs. Peppy look: This model was snapped running in a sweatsuit from the collection, which features a peplum back. She later added: 'The Sacai collection is undoubtedly a vanity project for Nike, but its premise - that female athletes prize style and appearance over functionality and performance - is completely tone-deaf.' Others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated, billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity. 'Seriously, that Nike women's line is HIDEOUS. Women's athletic wear needs improving, but this is NOT an improvement. Capes? Dresses? WTF! (sic)' one commenter wrote on Twitter. New wings: The billowy fabric on these pieces from the line can be seen flowing in the as the model runs forward.

'The idea of functionality is important to me, as is fabric innovation, which has always been at the heart of Sacai,' Ms Abe said. 'For me, Nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core. It has been inspiring to work together.' Indeed, Ms Abe claims that the flamboyant-looking fabrics and over-the-top embellishments on each of the designs has been added in order to enhance the performance of the athlete. The back of one sweatshirt, for example, is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed by Abe and the brand.

This is almost 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in similar circumstances. Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it.", "article": "A 72-year-old woman is set to go on trial for shooting dead her second husband, nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in eerily similar circumstances. Colleen Ann Harris, whose case is expected to open on Wednesday, is accused of shooting dead her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013. Decades before, in 1985, she shot dead her first husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her. Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it. Accused: Colleen Ann Harris, left, is about to go on trial for the 2013 death of her husband, Bob Harris, right, whom she shot dead nearly 30 years after she shot dead her first husband. 'In each case, she kills her husband in the bedroom. In each case, she uses a shotgun,' said El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander, wrote in court papers, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'In each case, she is going through marital difficulties. In each case, she delays reporting the crime... In each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense.' She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her. She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia. The prosecution told a very different tale. They claimed she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense. She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office. Scene: She allegedly shot him dead in the couple's Placerville, California home (pictured) as they were going through marital problems. They had separated but he had returned to care for her after surgery. The jury ultimately said there was insufficient evidence that she intended to murder her husband and she was acquitted of murder. Then in 1990, she married Bob Harris, who had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later. Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported. When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out. But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her. 'My dad, bless his heart, was there taking care of Colleen despite whatever circumstances were going on between them,' his son Andy Harris told the Sacramento Bee. Then on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors claim. She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage. After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office. Harris, who married Colleen in 1990 despite her previous case, left behind two sons and a daughter, right. Beloved: He worked in the Forest Service\u00a0and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband. Mr Harris' family said they remain devastated by the loss. 'The death of your father is devastating enough,' Andy Harris said. 'And then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member. 'There is a real sense of betrayal and wondering if this person had the capacity to love.' His father had worked with the Forest Service for 30 years before retiring in 1997, according to his obituary. He umpired baseball, from Little League to semi-professional teams, and worked as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. A judge has ruled that prosecutors may talk about the first case in the upcoming trial. Attorney Eric Schlueter had fought the decision, saying in court papers: 'The prior incident has ZERO relevance to the current action especially in light of the fact that Mrs. Harris was ACQUITTED of the charge.'", "candidates": [["Colleen Ann Harris, a 72-year-old woman, is set to go on trial for shooting dead her second husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013.

However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At \u00a31.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon. Marketed as the Yowk -'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven. Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk. Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.'

{"abstract": "Experts have warned that Spanish slugs, which are known for their cannibalistic tendencies and can grow up to six inches long, are set to cause destruction in gardens across Britain. Two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for the species to expand their territory, and it is expected to spread even further this year. The slug, which is not able to survive extremely cold winters, was first spotted in the UK in 2012 and has since been reported in several areas.", "article": "Giant \u2018cannibal\u2019 slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across Britain, experts have warned. Two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs - an horrific, aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory. The species, nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives, was first spotted in this country in 2012. The giant Spanish slug, pictured, was first spotted in the UK in 2012 and is now starting to take hold. Sightings have since been reported in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, London and Hampshire. But this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further. Dr Ian Bedford, the expert who first identified the species three years ago, warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters. \u2018If this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before May we could see very high numbers of the Spanish slug this year,\u2019 he said. Dr Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said the slug - which officially is called Arion vulgaris and originates in southern Europe - cannot survive extreme cold temperatures. Common native slugs, although less aggressive, are much better at surviving cold conditions. Experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year, because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes. The winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps, blizzards and frosts, which hit the new population of Spanish slugs hard. But the intervening two winters have been much warmer, particularly in southern England which has barely seen any snow in 24 months. The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C (39.9F), and the year before was even warmer at 5.8C (42.4F). The average English winter temperature is 4.2C (39.6F). Slug expert Dr Ian Bedford, pictured, said Britain was on course for record numbers of Spanish slugs. The slug, pictured, is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions. The Spanish slugs, which are thought to have made it to the British mainland on imported vegetables, have been recorded feeding on dead mice, meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets. They also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners. Unlike native species, they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them. They also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs, so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly. Dr Bedford said: \u2018If you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water, add a bit of household bleach, and then bury the remains 18 inches deep. \u2018If they spread it could really affect British farmers. We found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs. \u2018If we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year.\u2019 Anna Platoni, entomologist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year. \u2018Although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity, it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important, rather than over the winter,\u2019 she said. \u2018They tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather.\u2019 Sarah Fuller, marketing director at Wyevale Garden Centres added: \u2018Slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners, making this hobby and pastime a true 24-hour activity. \u2018Last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month. \u2018It\u2019s likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods.\u2019", "candidates": [["The 'cannibal' Spanish slug, nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives, was first spotted in the UK in 2012 and is now starting to take hold.

According to accident investigators at the time, the service was en-route to Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, from Paris with stops in Nice, Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan and India. However, the plane encountered stormy weather over the French Alps with residents in the small village of Fours St. Laurent reporting seeing the aircraft crash into the mountainside and burst into flames.

Her seven downhill titles and her 18th crystal globe are both records for women. 'It's incredible after being out with two knee operations. It is just amazing to be sitting where I am today,' the American said. 'I'm so proud and happy, and I really have to thank the people that supported me and got me back to where I am now.' Lindsey Vonn won her seventh downhill title by pipping\u00a0Elisabeth Goergl to the finish line. Vonn is delighted to be competing for major honours  after undergoing two knee operations. Vonn finished 0.24 seconds ahead of Elisabeth Goergl and 0.30 ahead of Nicole Hosp. Austrian racer Anna Fenninger finished second in the downhill standings. She trailed Vonn by 35 points heading into the race, and failed to make an impact on the Roc de Fer course, finishing nearly one second behind Vonn in eighth place. Vonn, who raced immediately after her, increased her speed on the bottom section to clinch a 66th career race win. She is the all-time leader in wins. Some fans near the finish held up banners saying 'Congrats Lindsey' as she raised her poles. Vonn finished the downhill season with 502 points, putting her 103 ahead of Fenninger. Tina Maze of Slovenia was third with 356. In the race for the women's overall World Cup title, Fenninger holds a 12-point lead over Maze. Vonn finished ahead of second-placed Anna Fenninger to win the downhill globe. Maze gained some ground on Fenninger by finishing fourth on Wednesday. Vonn, a four-time overall World Cup champion, is out of contention for the overall title this season. Vonn blew out her right knee in a super-G at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria. She hurt her knee again in her comeback, keeping her out of last year's Sochi Olympics. She went nearly two years without a victory before winning a downhill in Lake Louise, Canada, in December. The following month, she overtook Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 World Cup victories. 'I'm incredibly thankful to be holding another downhill title,' Vonn said. 'It's been a long two years coming back from my injuries.' Vonn looks extremely focused as she speeds down the course during the alpine ski. Vonn will battle with Fenninger again on Thursday when the super-G title will be decided. Vonn is eight points ahead of Fenninger. 'Tomorrow is a chance for another globe. It's going to be tough because Anna's skiing really well, and it's going to be soft conditions like it was today,' Vonn said. 'But something about this track suits me. I'll give my all, as I always do.' Fenninger has been in great form, winning gold medals in giant slalom and super-G at the world championships last month, and placing second in downhill behind Maze, who finished second to Fenninger in super-G at the worlds.

But he had not realised he had actually been talking to the young girl's father. When he arrived for the supposed meeting, the man badly beat him and filmed it before killing him.

Tom Dahl (above), 85, from West Seattle has shared the frightening video taken from his driveway to warn neighbors of the new ways criminals are hacking into cars. The incident, which occurred last month, involved an unidentified 'key fob' to unlock the vehicle, Detective Patrick Michaud from the Seattle Police Department told Daily Mail Online. Detective Michaud said police received reports of the break in on February 14 at 3am, and that the man seen in the video has not been arrested. The man reportedly searched the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment and took a club that was on his steering wheel, as well as a few store rewards cards that were left in the car, Daily Mail Online was told. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car, according to\u00a0Fox 13. 'You used to have a wire that you slid down the window, when it was mechanical. But now it's electronic,' said Mr Dahl. The man approaches Mr Dahl's car and pulls the handles realizing the door is locked. He then removes his backpack and flashes a light into the car. The man holds the backpack up the door and within seconds it is unlocked. He gets into the vehicle and searches through the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment taking a club on the steering wheel as well as store rewards cards.

But the first arrivals were not the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the Lindo Wing were Michael and Carole Middleton - better known to George as 'Grandpa Michael' and 'Granny Carole'. Almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away, the Middletons have become a fixture in little George's life - with Prince Charles left to complain that they 'never let me see my grandson'. Scroll down for video. March of the Middletons: Prince Charles is reportedly upset by what he calls 'the March of the Middletons' In this case, the heir to the throne may well have a point. Visits to Highgrove, Charles' Gloucestershire home, have been few and far between. By contrast, William and Kate regularly take their son to the Berkshire village of Bucklebury where the Middletons live in a \u00a34.5m Georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside. Indeed, it was to Bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the Lindo Wing, with Prince George's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather Michael. The intimate photos, which show George cradled in the arms of his smiling mother, were, with hindsight, a sign of things to come. Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, was always determined to be a hands-on grandmother - and so it has proved. First visitors: Carole and Michael Middleton were the first people to meet the newborn Prince George. Sign of things to come: His first official photo was taken on the lawn of the Middletons' Bucklebury home. But the Middleton matriarch's determination to be involved in her grandson's life hasn't always gone down well with the rest of the family. 'Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats,' confided a source to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare. 'All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.' So how much involvement does Carole have in George's life? The answer is plenty. From cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child, there are few areas of George's life in which the Middletons aren't involved. Just a few weeks ago, Carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in Mustique, where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday. Although nanny Maria Theresa Borallo was there to deal with most of the childcare, Carole, who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson, was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand-in-hand with a toddling George. Holiday: George and his parents often holiday with the Middletons, seen here en route to Mustique. 'Queen Carole': Sources say Carole is taking an increasing amount of control over Prince George's life. Involved: Carole, seen here with the Duchess of Cornwall, is said to be a hands-on grandmother to George. And that is far from the only occasion that Carole has enjoyed one-on-one time with George. Just before the trip to Mustique, the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer's market with the third-in-line, who was, say witnesses, 'trying all the food'. Speaking to People Magazine, another onlooker told of Carole's obvious pride in her grandson's progress. 'It was just really, really sweet. He was just being like a normal toddler is, running around and exploring \u2013 he is such a sweetie. He's lovely. A real bundle of fun. 'She [Carole] just keeps telling people \"He's gorgeous, isn't he?\" like any other grandmother would say about their little one.' The Middletons also joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their infant son at Anmer Hall on Christmas Day where, according to sources, Kate made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get-togethers. Carole's influence could also be seen in the plans for George's first birthday celebrations which, in a break with royal tradition, included a Peter Rabbit themed party. Not amused: Charles is said to dislike what he sees as his 'peripheral' role in Prince George's life. Loving: This framed photograph of Charles and George has pride of place at Clarence House.

{"abstract": "Scientists are using seismic tremors to create a 3D picture of Earth's mantle, the layer between the crust and outer core. By analysing the speed of the tremors, researchers can reveal the existence of subterranean structures and create simulations of the mantle. The resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates and magma that causes volcanic activity.", "article": "Scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble-like simulations of Earth's interior. By recording seismic tremors, researchers are able to build a 3D picture of Earth's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core. They do this by analysing the speed of the tremors, which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma. Computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures. In this view of the mantle below the Pacific Ocean, slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue. The Princeton team fed data from seismograms into a computer model, which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter. The resulting \"synthetic seismograms\" were compared to real seismograms, and the differences fed back into the model to improve it. The researchers do this repeatedly, comparing data with simulations and extracting differences. With each pass, they improve their model. In these images, slower waves are in red and orange, while faster vibrations are in green and blue. The 3D models were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km) - by the end of the year. His team have been using the number-crunching capabilities of the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second. Professor Tromp has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater, which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide. These stations make recordings, or seismograms, that detail the movement produced by seismic waves, which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes. 'We are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes,' said Professor Tromp, 'but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features.' The resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates, which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other. The images were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a 3D map of the entire mantle, down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km), by the end of the year. A three-dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average. The maps could also reveal the locations of magma that, if it comes to the surface, causes volcanic activity, the researchers said. Previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves: primary or compressional waves, secondary or shear waves, and surface waves. Professor Tromp technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake \u2013 described as adjoint waves. The Titan computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter, and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms. The differences are then used by Titan to improve its model. Professor Tromp said: 'You don't know what it is you are looking for\u2026that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover.' This map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles (389 km). Blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds, and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds. The two panels on the right show a 746 miles (1,200 km) deep slice of the Earth taken from points B to b in Europe as shown in the left panel.

Mike Brown was one of the better performers but England spurned too many opportunities at Twickenham. Despite the predictions, though, Saturday's battle for the Calcutta Cup told us plenty about England\u2019s prospects in the autumn. It wasn\u2019t all good by any means. In fact, the evidence of an exhilarating first half suggested again that England are still short of the standard they have to achieve to be realistic contenders for the World Cup.

Despite concerns that the match had not sold out, the atmosphere at Twickenham had been bolstered by the scenes playing on the screens inside and outside the stadium from Cardiff where Wales\u2019 victory over Ireland put England back in with a chance of winning the Six Nations. When England tore Scotland apart in the opening minutes, it felt as if this could yet be the game that ignited their confidence and laid the foundation for future success. That feeling did not last for long. George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half but the first half will have worried them. The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup. Defeating Scotland however will not lead the top nations to fear England, and time is running out. England were not ruthless enough in attack. They squandered chance after chance to convert breakaways, eschewing easy passes, making the wrong decisions. They should have scored four tries before half-time but they were limited to Jonathan Joseph\u2019s score after a neat sidestep five minutes into the game. It seemed then as if England were about to embark on the points rampage that would put them in prime position ahead of the final fixtures of the competition next weekend. That rampage did not materialise. Instead, Scotland came back into the game and more doubts began to surface about England. This time, it was their defence which suffered in comparison to the heroic efforts of the Welsh earlier in the day. Mark Bennett bulldozed his way over for a score with Scotland\u2019s first chance of the game midway through the half. Twickenham may still be a formidable place to get a result, but England are not unbeatable there. Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway as Lancaster's side returned to the Six Nations summit. England allowed Scotland back into the game too easily, and they lack momentum heading to the World Cup. Scotland actually led 13-10 at the interval. Their supporters began to dream of a first victory at Twickenham for 32 years. It was hardly the response to the defeat in Dublin that Lancaster was looking for. \u2018England need to be careful out there or they could end up with real egg on their face,\u2019 Woodward said at half-time. England banished that idea when George Ford burst over for a try three minutes into the second half but, even though Scotland never threatened again, England remained unconvincing.

Former First Minister Alex Salmond, meanwhile, has boasted that the SNP will hold the balance of power in the Commons after the next election and will be able to force Labour to increase spending, borrowing and debt. Mr McDonnell has held talks with Mr Miliband and said he has already \u2018moved the party on to our agenda\u2019. In a recent meeting, he told Mr Miliband that any government he leads could be \u2018the most radical\u2019 and \u2018perhaps more radical\u2019 since Clement Attlee. He claimed Mr Miliband had agreed. Mr McDonnell said that if Labour falls short of a majority it would have to abandon its pledge to impose spending cuts because of the pressure from left in the party.

He was removed by police and detained for causing a disruption for others on board the plane, which was travelling from Urumqi to Zhengzhou.

In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors on a China Eastern flight in Chengdu. In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors in protest of a weather-related delay as their China Eastern flight taxied to a runway in Chengdu.

{"abstract": "Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party in the UK, has been criticised for having two kitchens in his \u00a32.5m North London home, after he was filmed in a small kitchenette with his wife for a TV interview. A family friend has since revealed that the kitchenette is only used for \u201ctea and quick snacks\u201d and that the family\u2019s main kitchen is \u201clovely\u201d. Critics have accused Miliband of trying to make his family life appear more humble than it is, in order to bolster his \u201cman of the people\u201d image.", "article": "If you can't stand the heat, get out of your second kitchen. Ed Miliband today sought to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras. The Labour leader, who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities,was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife Justine in a modest kitchen at his \u00a32million North London home. Now it has emerged that the image of the Labour leader as a man of the people with a run-of-the-mill home was not all it appeared. For Mr Miliband actually lives in a house with two kitchens. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children tonight revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' The poky room the couple were pictured in, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed last night by a family friend to be a 'functional kitchenette' for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Today Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail. 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in yesterday's paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen. Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day. Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'.

Police said after the early morning bar fight Solis pursued his victim on foot in the nightclub district and shot him multiple times. Garriola said Solis then reportedly called his father in Lancaster, California, and later that morning they began the trek to El Paso. Victor Solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in El Paso and his son made some incriminating statements \"not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again,\" Garriola said.

If found guilty they could face long prison sentences, or even the death penalty. The brothers set off firecrackers, like the ones pictured, during their wedding ceremony in Karachi, Pakistan, but now face spending their married life behind bars after being charged with terrorism offences. Setting off fireworks and firing weapons into the air is a longstanding custom at Pakistani weddings, but police officer Abbas Golarchi said the wedding party's celebrations scared the community living nearby. He told agency AFP: 'Very powerful crackers were being used during the marriage ceremony creating fear among the neighbourhood, a densely populated area of the city.' The five arrested are in police custody awaiting a remand hearing which is due to take place on Wednesday. A sentence of the death penalty is unlikely, it is thought, before no-one was harmed during the joint wedding celebration. It is customary at Pakistani weddings to set off firecrackers and fireworks, and human rights campaigners have accused the police and judiciary of using anti-terrorism legislation in cases not related to militancy. Human rights campaigners say Pakistan's anti-terrorism legislation and anti-terrorism courts are frequently misused to prosecute cases that have nothing to do with militancy. In their World Report 2015, Human Rights Watch criticised the passing of the Protection of Pakistan Act by the country's government, denouncing it as 'overly broad' counter-terrorism legislation that violates international human rights standards and allows security forces to act without accountability. More generally, Pakistani police are often criticised for their heavy-handed approach. In April last year, police in the eastern city of Lahore booked a nine-month-old boy on an attempted murder charge after his family members allegedly threw bricks at officers trying to collect an unpaid bill.

'They got their first league win away from home in four months in the week (at Sheffield Wednesday) but we will give them the same respect we would give Manchester City or any other team,' said the Liverpool boss. 'It is a big game. We made it clear our intent in this competition was to get to the final and win it and to do that you have to beat different types of teams and Blackburn will come and look to make it difficult for us. 'I think (Rovers manager) Gary Bowyer has done an outstanding job since he has gone in there.

'He has gone in there in very difficult circumstances and stabilised the club and got everyone on the same path and has done an outstanding job.' While securing Champions League football for next season remains the priority Rodgers would dearly love to win some silverware in his third year in charge. Having reached the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup he hopes to go at least one better in this competition, although he admits he is only interested in a final at Wembley. 'People say getting to Wembley for the semi-final is a big thing but not really. Winning and getting to the final is the big priority,' he said. 'In many ways I wish the semi-final wasn't at Wembley because I think it takes a little bit away from it. For me Wembley should be the ultimate game. 'But of course it is a great opportunity if we do go through to play a game at Wembley, which we certainly wouldn't turn down.

They have conceded just six goals in nine league matches since the turn of the year, during which time they are unbeaten. Despite enforced changes to his backline everyone now appears to know what job they are supposed to be doing - unlike earlier in the campaign when no matter who he brought in there was always an air of vulnerability. 'What is pleasing are the poor goals we have stopped conceding,' he said. 'Our method of play is based on aggressive pressure and with that you limit teams to not many opportunities. 'When that doesn't function well you concede poor goals. That was the key, we made too many mistakes.

{"abstract": "Karl Turk, the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Texas, has overcome a rare disease that left him paralysed from the waist down at the age of 14. Turk, who was told he might never walk again, has coached his team to the state playoffs in his first season as head coach. Turk's story is an inspiration to his young players, who say he shows them to never give up on their dreams.", "article": "(CNN)On the basketball court, Karl Turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane. He'll get so caught up in the moment that he'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying. He's in the zone. Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players. \"Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams,\" says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers. All that changed on January 21, 1994. That night, the 14-year-old watched the Chicago Bulls beat his Pacers in an intense game. He walked to bed. He woke up paralyzed. He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again. \"Most patients do not recover well,\" said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital. A turning point came when Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' all-star player and Turk's favorite basketballer, heard about what Turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital. Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories. The basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces, similar to the ones Turk was wearing at the time. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out. \"Reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who I was,\" Turk said. \"For that moment, I felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness.\" It's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams. There was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance. Turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane, which he continues to walk with today. \"I keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where I have come from,\" said Turk. Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations. \"When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can,\" Arrow, now retired, told CNN. \"But he gets the job done no matter what.\" All Turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team. But it wasn't so easy. From 2009 to 2010, he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions. He only received one interview. The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching. \"I knew my resume was competitive,\" he said. \"I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone.\" He began to wonder if \"having a cane and an unusual gait\" would prevent him from ever coaching. In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve. In 2010, he was hired as assistant coach at West Oso. And in 2014, almost 10 years after moving to Corpus Christi, he became the head coach. He has strived to embody the ideals that Reggie Miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital. \"I want my students to know that I care about them, that I work for and belong to them,\" said Turk. \"So often, it's the messenger more than the message, I want to be the messenger that my students embrace.\" In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games. There isn't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down, and he", "candidates": [["Karl Turk, a man who was told he might never walk again, is coaching his team in the state playoffs at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Belgian midfielder also backed his compatriot Adnan Januzaj to make an impact at Old Trafford, stating that he has accepted his current situation and will work harder to try to come back to the national team.", "article": "Marouane Fellaini says it is 'nonsense' to suggest that Manchester United are turning into a route-one team by taking advantage of his height and power. Louis van Gaal has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in Belgium midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker, and it proved effective once again when United won 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a Champions League place. It has also led to criticism of United's tactics, with even West Ham boss Sam Allardyce labelling Van Gaal's team 'Long Ball United' after Fellaini's physical presence helped snatch a 1-1 draw at Upton Park last month. Marouane Fellaini (challenging Emre Can on Sunday) has slammed Manchester United's critics. Louis van Gaal's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut Premier League season. But Fellaini said: 'It is nonsense that our game system is based on me. Our system is based on many good players. 'We play a beautiful football. We play forward, scoring, putting on pressure. There are great players around.' Fellaini came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under David Moyes last season after following his old Everton boss to United in a \u00a327.5million deal, but can also play as a box-to-box midfielder. The 27-year-old admits it would be easier to pin down one position but is just grateful to be playing after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford. 'Fellaini is at his best when he plays,' he added. 'It does not matter where. This season we have played many different tactics: 3-5-2, 5-3-2, 4-2-2-2, 4-3-3. Of course, it would be easier to play in one position, but you have to always adjust to the coach. I play, that's the main thing. 'I can play in different positions. Number six, number eight or as a second striker. At eight, I can go back and forth and arrive in the box. Second striker I played at Everton. At United it's different because I play in a triangle in midfield. It's simple: I adjust myself to the system of the coach.' Fellaini admits that strict disciplinarian Van Gaal is exactly the kind of character United needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the Premier League under Moyes last season. Fellaini's performances are vastly improved under Van Gaal (pictured scoring against Tottenham this month) It looked as though Fellaini would be one of the first players out of the exit, but Van Gaal reassured him that he could still have a future at United when he arrived last summer. 'He told me \"prove yourself and we'll see\". Now they are counting on me. There were never any real doubts. I was injured at the beginning of the season and then returned. 'The coach gave me confidence and I proved myself in a few matches. After that, I was injured and I got sick again. For three weeks I was on antibiotics. It took a while, but now I can finally enjoy. 'The coach is very strict, but that's good. We needed such a coach. Last season we had a bad season. We even missed European qualification. We needed a coach who would put some players' feet back on the ground. Fellaini also backed Belgium team-mate Adnan Januzaj (far right) to make an impact at Old Trafford. 'If he says something, you should do it. Otherwise you'll fly out of it. If he has to take you off the pitch when the game hasn't been going on for more than 30 minutes he'll do it. Or during half-time. Fortunately, it hasn't happened to me yet.' Fellaini had some words of encouragement for his Belgian compatriot Adnan Januzaj who has struggled to make an impact under Van Gaal. The 20-year-old's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the Belgium squad for the forthcoming games against Cyprus and Israel. 'He has accepted his current situation,' said Fellaini. 'I try to help him. He knows he must play if he wants to come back for Belgium. It is part of growing up. He will now work harder to try to come back to the national team.'", "candidates": [["Marouane Fellaini has dismissed criticism that Manchester United are turning into a route-one team by taking advantage of his height and power.

With six or seven people chasing every top London property, bidders are desperate to beat their rivals to seal the deal on a home. The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine, according to letting agents E J Harris.", "article": "Wealthy renters have paid \u00a3100 million up-front this year alone to cover their entire tenancy as competition for ideal homes intensifies, it was revealed today. With six or seven people chasing every top London property, bidders are desperate to beat their rivals to seal the deal on a home. As a result they are willing to pay a full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front - handing over \u00a3200,000 on average to the landlord. Areas in most demand: A map shows the top ten locations for up front rental payments in London. This is based on figures from Dataloft, which says the average prime London home costs \u00a33,500 per week to rent. In total, around \u00a3100 million has been paid up front in the first ten weeks of 2015, which is twice as much as the same period last year. The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine, according to letting agents E J Harris. Stamp Duty has also turned vendors into landlords and buyers into tenants as the central London \u00a32 million to \u00a320 million sales market has stalled. A number of these rich people are happy to pay their entire tenancy up front despite the properties costing them around \u00a310,000 per week. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, above, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. The top ten locations for up front rental payments are Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. Elizabeth Harris, managing director of E J Harris, said: 'The dramatic rise in up front tenancy payments is driven by several factors. 'Stamp Duty and mansion tax concerns has turned purchasers into tenants and so competition has risen for the best homes which has led to a rise in up front bids. A photo taken on Eaton Place in Belgravia - the area in London came second in the top ten list of up front rental payments. 'The London lettings market has become increasingly international with a new wave of wealthy tenants from Russia, Ukraine, Nigeria and China who are happy to pay their rents entirely up front. Estate agent\u00a0Tunstall Lettings had one case where a young woman in China paid \u00a34million up front for five years for a property in One Hyde Park. E J Harris had another case of a wealthy Nigerian paying more than \u00a31million up front to rent a property in Mayfair. 'Despite new lettings coming onto the market, the speed at which new lettings instructions are getting tenant offers has increased dramatically, so the number of available lettings properties is actually lower at the end of each week.' The mad market has been highlighted by a number of eye-opening deals. A one-bedroom Mayfair apartment was snapped up by a desperate tenant in a record-breaking 40 minutes. An a wealthy young man paid \u00a3400,000 up-front to rent a luxury flat only to love the place so much he bought it three days later - for more than \u00a310 million. Mark Tunstall, managing director of Tunstall Property, added: 'They have the financial wherewithal to sidestep the referencing requirements usually imposed by landlords by offering up-front lump-sum payments. 'Whilst global interest rates remain at historical lows it is of little consequence if those with substantial liquid cash reserves have to pay their rent in advance. 'And similarly, it doesn't confer the benefits on landlords that it used to do, when they would often accept a discount on the asking rent in return for the benefit of a slug of cash which they could then invest profitably elsewhere.' Knightsbridge came third on the list of top ten areas where money is paid up front for property rental.", "candidates": [["Competition for ideal homes in London is intensifying, with six or seven people chasing every top London property.

The preacher stood on a step ladder  in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall on Saturday afternoon ahead of the city's Mardi Gras parade before a group of buskers started to drown him out. 'Before I could look up, people were surrounding him and few of them were happy,' the musician told Daily Mail Australia. According to Mr Winter, the hateful messages quickly became aggressive and soon started to cause a lot of tension in the crowd. 'It was Mardi Gras - not only a day to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights, but also equality and unity towards all people,' he said.

The Baggies defender was dismissed by Neil Swarbrick instead of teammate Michael Dawson who sent Wilfried Bony crashing to the floor when he was clean through. After the match an incredulous Pulis said: 'I can't believe he's picked the wrong player - it's beyond me.' Tony Pulis has called for the introduction of video technology to help referees after Neil Swarbrick's error. Swarbrick showed a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute after a foul on Wilfried Bony. West Brom defender Craig Dawson (right) makes the original challenge on Bony just outside the penalty area. The Ivorian striker heads to the ground under Dawson's clumsy challenge but managed to continue. Bony continues but McAuley  comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area. Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player. He added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced. 'It is no good moaning about referees,' Pulis said. 'We have to find a way to help referees out I would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video. 'The clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards. It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world. The sooner that comes in the better.' BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him. A difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from Wilfried Bony, Fernando and David Silva wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are, for now, three points behind leaders Chelsea who have two games in hand. City manager Manuel Pellegrini reflected on a morale-boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at Burnley and then bow out of the Champions League at Barcelona. 'Of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game,' he said. 'We lost the last two games in different competitions, Wednesday in Champions League and the last game against Burnley in Premier League. It is important to return to victory.' Fernando (centre) scored City's second of the match after Bony's opener and before David Silva added a third. The Chilean added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on Jose Mourinho's leaders. 'We are not thinking about that,' he said. 'I spoke with the players, we play now eight games more. We can win the eight games and if Chelsea doesn't drop points, we cannot win the title. The important thing is not to think about other teams, it is to think about our team, to improve and win the next game against Crystal Palace.'", "candidates": [["Gareth McAuley was sent off in a case of mistaken identity after 90 seconds of West Brom's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City.

{"abstract": "Wisconsin and Connecticut are the only two states in the US that have legislation requiring an independent investigation into police shootings. The law in Wisconsin, which was enacted last April, requires an investigation conducted by at least two investigators who are not employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death. The investigators must then provide a report to the district attorney, and if the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public.", "article": "(CNN)When an officer kills an unarmed suspect, the question arises time and again: Can a police department investigate a high-stakes case involving one of its own, without bias? For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. \"The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,\" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. \"I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,\" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. \"We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that.\" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires \"an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. \"Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,\" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. \"This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. \"Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,\" she said. \"There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed.\" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. \"Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,\" he said. \"And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.\"There are \"powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,\" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. \"For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,\" he said. \"If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system.\" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.

{"abstract": "Liverpool's progress since their defeat at Old Trafford in December has been remarkable, with the team remaining unbeaten in the Premier League this year. The success is largely due to the tactical triumph of manager Brendan Rodgers, who has torn up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and come up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. The decision to move Emre Can into a back three and drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season have also proved to be astute pieces of leadership by Rodgers.", "article": "The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday. Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system. Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench. Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder \u2013 was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool\u2019s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea\u2019s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool\u2019s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville\u2019s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson\u2019s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection. But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea\u2019s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night.

But now, he has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace the Comedy Central program's host Jon Stewart (right) 'Shortlisted': The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year. According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days. Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.' If Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - replaces Stewart on The Daily Show this year, he will be joining a primarily white, male and straight late night show landscape. At present, Comedy Central is the only network to have an African-American host: Larry Wilmore, A network spokesman declined to tell Variety whether Noah was being considered for Stewart's job. No stranger to controversy: During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, Noah (pictured during the broadcast) used his mixed-race heritage and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests in the US over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart that his arms were 'tired' from constantly 'holding them up' Thorny issues: 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart. Noah, who grew up in Gauteng, started his entertainment career at 18 on the\u00a0South African soap opera, Isidingo. He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station. Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out. In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show. The following year, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman. During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, the comedian, whose mother is a black South African and father is a white Swiss, discussed race and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests across the United States over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart his arms were 'tired' because he had been constantly 'holding them up' since he had arrived in America. Positive: Over the past 24 hours, people across the country have been taking to social media to express their views on Noah as the potential new host of The Daily Show, with many deeming it 'great' news (pictured) 'A great addition': Briton Tim Browning tweeted Noah, asking: 'Any truth to rumour about the daily show?'

Barbaric: Islamic State militants dealt yet another blow to Christian history in Iraq this week by using explosives to destroy the 4th Century Mar Benham monastery. Mar Benham monastery was captured by ISIS last July in a lightning advance that saw the militants seize control of vast swathes of northern Iraq - including the country's second largest city, Mosul. Resident monks who live in the building - which is also known as the Monastery of the Martyrs Saint Behnam and his Sister Sarah, and was once visited by thousands of Christians and Muslims every year - were subsequently forced to leave and flee to nearby Christian villages. The destruction of the religious building was subsequently confirmed by Barzan Sadiq, executive producer at Kurdish Rudaw media network, according to the International Business Times.

In a report based on interviews with more than 100 alleged victims and witnesses, it urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court for prosecution of perpetrators. The report also said Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias'may have committed some war crimes' while battling the insurgency. The U.N. Human Rights Council launched its inquiry in September after the Islamist militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized large swathes of northern Iraq. The oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Mosul is a notorious stronghold for the Islamic State terrorist organisation. Stronghold: Last summer ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) made his first and so far only filmed public appearance when he delivered a firebrand sermon in Mosul's Great Mosque. The report said the Council had found 'information that points to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes', and that the Security Council should 'consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court'. There was a'manifest pattern of attacks' by Islamic State on Yezidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq. The U.N. investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September. Captured women and children were treated as'spoils of war', and often subjected to rape or sexual slavery, it said.

They exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a \u2018white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the UK and further afield. The experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid. The low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid-summer.

Bright lights in Europe\u2019s cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins. Animal biologists from Glasgow University and the Max Planck Institute for Orntihology in Seewiesen, near Munich, fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of Munich and in a nearby forest. The light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts. They found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average. The additional light had an effect on the city birds\u2019 photoperiod, which is the part of the day that organisms use to time their daily and seasonal biology. As a result, the birds in early March experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late March, according to the study published in journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. The city birds\u2019 perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds. Study leader Dr Davide Dominoni of the university, said: \u2018Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals. \u2018The global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species, but we\u2019re very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night.' They found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-August due to the limited amount of food available. Professor Kevin Gaston, Director of the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) said: \u2018These are the first findings from major long-term experiments \u2026 and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms.\u2019 Dr Jonathan Bennie added: \u2018Our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs. \u2018While we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night, we show that they may have more permanent, widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.\u2019 Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don\u2019t like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street-lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat.

{"abstract": "A new study has found that babies conceived through IVF may be twice as likely to develop autism. However, the study did not prove that the treatment caused the disorder, and the higher risk could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with IVF, not the treatment itself. The increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old, and there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child.", "article": "Babies conceived through IVF may be twice as likely to develop autism, according to new research. Children conceived using assisted reproductive technology were more likely to develop autism than babies conceived naturally. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes any type of fertility treatment where the egg and the sperm are handled outside of the body, including IVF, artificial insemination and surrogacy. During IVF - the most popular ART treatment - more than one egg is harvested and fertilised, which can lead to multiple births. Babies conceived through IVF (pictured) are more likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally, a study found. But this could be due to the complications of IVF, such as multiple births. Researchers explained they found an association between IVF and autism - but they did not prove that the treatment cause the disorder,\u00a0according to HealthDay news. The higher risk of the disorder could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with IVF, not the treatment itself, they said. After taking into account factors such as the mother's education and multiple births, researchers found the increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old. And they found there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child. This means IVF using a single-egg transfer rather than multiple eggs lowers the chance of a baby developing autism, experts said. The study involved nearly six million children born from 1997 to 2007. The team, led by Peter Bearman, a professor of social sciences at Columbia University in New York City, collected data on 5.9 million California births, including 48,865 infants conceived through assisted reproduction, and 32,922 children with autism. Autism is mainly caused by a child\u2019s genes, a major study of British twins has found. Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King\u2019s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. They compared the incidence of autism in births that involved advanced infertility treatment such as IVF and those that didn't. Professor Bearman said this was the largest study looking at this relationship that has ever been carried out. The results are not a condemnation of IVF technology, as the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link, he said. He added: 'There is an association between IVF and autism, but when we control for the characteristics of women who are more likely to use IVF, for example, age and social status, this association is lessened significantly,' The remaining increased risk is due to factors such as multiple births and complications of pregnancy and delivery associated with IVF, he said. He added that there was no significant increased risk of the disorder for children of women who gave birth to one child. He said: 'Knowing that one can largely reduce the risk of autism by restricting the procedure to single-egg transfer is important for women who can then make better informed decisions.' The research was published online in the American Journal of Public Health. The news comes after a major study published this week found genetics are the main cause of a child's autism, not lifestyle. Scientists from King's College London said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness.

Since the financially struggling city broke away from the Detroit water system last year, residents have been unhappy with the smell, taste and appearance of water from the city's river as they await the completion of a pipe to Lake Huron. They also have raised health concerns, reporting rashes, hair loss and other problems. A General Motors plant stopped using the water, saying it was rusting its parts. Officials say recent state tests show the water meets federal safety guidelines, and the city will be better off free of the leviathan Detroit system once the pipeline is complete by 2016. And while many Detroit suburbs have long dreamed of breaking their dependence on the city's water, further-away Flint is the first to risk it \u2014 and test whether the potential savings are worth going it alone.

Giveway: In this Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015 photo, Genetha Campbell carries free water being distributed at the Lincoln Park United Methodist Church in Flint. 'Unfortunately, some of our problems aren't quickly or easily solved,' said Jerry Ambrose, Flint's state-appointed emergency manager, adding that the 'challenges' resulting from the temporary reliance on the river 'were greater than we expected.' 'The potential to leave (Detroit) was well-supported by a business case, and in the long-term will benefit this region as well as the city of Flint,' Ambrose said. While there won't be'magical reductions' in rates, he said, cost increases should be much less. Flint had long chafed at the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department's rising prices. Flint officials estimated the cost of buying water from Detroit this year at $16 million, and the overall annual cost of switching to the new Karegnondi Water Authority would be $12.5 million. Still, the long-discussed divorce has brought real and figurative headaches. Tests released last week show the water is safe, but complaints from residents persist. They say the water looks brown or rusty, and tastes and smells of chlorine. People have protested at council meetings, held community hearings, hosted water giveaways and marched through downtown. Facebook pages have been forums for complaints and concerns. Last month, the county started distributing bottled water to about 1,300 preschool students and a children's museum recently blocked access to water fountains, citing Safe Drinking Water Act violations because of high levels of a disinfectant byproduct. High bacteria levels forced boil-water advisories last year. Resident Tony Palladeno Jr., 53, said he gets bottled water from a grocery store or spring water from his cabin further north, but uses city water for showers. 'No matter what, if I go in, one time it's going to be my eyes, or I'll get headaches or my lungs,' he said, adding that he's lost hair and produces a bottle of it to illustrate. 'People say, \"Oh, it's paranoia.\" No.... I'm living this.'

Palladeno, who considers his city 'a guinea pig,' and others are angered by the decision to let the GM Engine Plant stop using Flint water and link with a township that gets water from Detroit. The move could cost the city about $400,000 per year in lost revenue. Rick Holtstander boiled his tap water at first, but says he rubbed his finger around the inside of the pan and picked up'something that looked just like cigarette ash.' 'I don't even let my dogs drink this water,' he said as he collected four gallons at a recent water giveaway. Activists have urged Flint to return to Detroit's system, which has offered to reconnect the city at last year's rates. Other Detroit water customers are watching how the situation unfolds. Between Flint and Detroit sits Oakland County, where County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has often spoken about mismanagement in Detroit's system. He has in the past has explored building a separate water and sewer structure, and has celebrated efforts to create a regional Great Lakes Water Authority to take over operations of Detroit's water system.

I think he is already at a level that he can definitely play with the senior team,' Klinsmann told reporters. Although Zelalem has yet to feature in a Premier League game for Arsenal he is seen as one of the most exciting prospects in the club's youth ranks. He made his first-team debut in the FA Cup win over Coventry City in January last year and made another appearance from the bench in the Champions League game away to Galatasaray in December 2014. USA head coach Jurgen Klinsmann hopes that FIFA grants Zelalem permission to play for his side. Klinsmann did not rule out the midfielder being given a slot in one of the U.S. youth teams at some stage but said he wanted to see him with the first team initially. 'Definitely I would like to see him with me first. I want to see how he interacts with the whole group and what level he is in. For the next dates, I am totally open to have him in the Under-23s,' he said. Zelalem lived in the United States from 2006 until 2013 when he joined London club Arsenal. Zelalem, playing for the Gunners during his debut last year against Coventry, lived in the USA from 2006-13. FIFA rules, designed to stop players from being granted citizenship for entirely football reasons, require players to live in a country for five years after their 18th birthday before they are eligible. The U.S. is hopeful of being granted a waiver in the case of Zelalem, given that his move to the country as a schoolboy had nothing to do with soccer.

Nearly 80 bank accounts linked to the gang have been frozen and six vehicles seized along with the boat and properties valued at nearly \u00a3600,000. Lead investigator, Inspector Mercedes Perez Quesada, said: 'The fraud was three-fold. 'Telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of Spanish law once they'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees. 'Any excuse to get money out of them was valid. 'Once victims had been conned and knew they were never going to get their money back, a second group of people would call claiming to be lawyers saying they were going to launch a group action on behalf of victims and asking once again for money upfront. 'The third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements. 'The scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between \u00a335 and \u00a335,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between \u00a33.5 million and \u00a34.5 million a year. 'The telesales operators were at the bottom rung of the fraud but knew exactly what was going on. 'The next level up were front men paid to open bank accounts so it made it more difficult to find out where the money had gone. 'They would receive commissions on the transfers of up to \u00a3360...Money collectors working for the three alleged ringleaders would collect up to \u00a32,150 from each front man on a daily basis and pass it on to their paymasters. 'The leaders were the brains behind the operation and the final recipients of the money... They started the operation we have smashed in 2009. Concern:\u00a0Police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the Costa del Sol (pictured) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol. Much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts. Two of the three alleged leaders were arrested along with 36 other suspects in raids in February during the first phase of the operation. The man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to Spain from the UK. A judge at a court in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola is now coordinating an ongoing criminal investigation. He is probing 11 companies believed to have been set up to facilitate the fraud. Two men including the alleged ringleader have been remanded in jail after a closed court hearing and the remainder released on bail. None of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under Spanish law, but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and membership of a criminal gang. Inspector Perez said: 'We know so far this organisation defrauded 500 British victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims.' Police also admitted the alleged ringleader had been arrested before for similar offences. They were not able to say whether he had been convicted in court. Malaga police chief Pedro Garijo Torres said: 'We don't want to comment on things that escape our control. 'The important thing for us was the police operation which is of huge significance in an area like Malaga whose economy relies so heavily on tourism and foreign visitors.' Government spokesman for the area Jorge Hernandez Mollar described the police operation, involving financial crime specialists from Madrid and Malaga, as 'brilliant.'", "candidates": [["A gang of timeshare fraudsters has been arrested by Spanish police, including 56 people, including the three alleged leaders, and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims.

{"abstract": "England's captain, Eoin Morgan, has shown little concern for the criticism that has followed England's poor performance in the World Cup, and has not acknowledged the team's over-reliance on statistics. England face Bangladesh on Monday, and if they lose, they will be eliminated from the tournament. Morgan has defended Gary Ballance, who has scored just 10, 10, 10 and 6 in the World Cup, and has suggested that the team will not be making any changes to the line-up.", "article": "If Eoin Morgan wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all England\u2019s many under-achieving World Cups then he made a good job of it. The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. The subject of England\u2019s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation. Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval. England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday. England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh. \u2018Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.\u2019 Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains? Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance\u2019s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England\u2019s first World Cup game against Australia. England warm up during a nets session at the Adelaide Oval where they will meet Bangladesh. Chris Jordan (left) is held back at the Adelaide Oval as he and his team-mates get prepared. Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. \u2018The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018There wasn\u2019t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won\u2019t be taken lightly nor quickly.\u2019 No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England\u2019s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament. If England really are determined not to pick Hales \u2014 and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer \u2014 then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again. Ravi Bopara (right) and Eoin Morgan of England look on during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval. Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores. England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh. The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three. Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult one really,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven\u2019t been able to take early wickets.\u2019 England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh \u2014 who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off \u2014 at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering.

Gross has become a catalyst for the new chapter in American and Cuban relations.", "article": "Havana, Cuba (CNN)So what has U.S. State Department subcontractor Alan Gross been up to since he was released from a Cuban prison exactly three months ago? It turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us. Gross, 65, has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in Cuba by traveling abroad, attending the State of the Union address as a guest of the Obamas and last week meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win Gross' freedom. After five years of being disconnected from the outside world, Gross now frequently posts on social media, writing of family reunions, eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in Cuba. \"I can't get away from Cuba,\" Gross wrote after hearing a Cuban song playing in an airport on his travels. While visiting Israel, he posted a photo of Cohiba cigars advertised for sale in a Tel Aviv tobacco shop. In 2009, Gross was arrested by Cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island. Gross said he was merely helping the island's small Jewish community get online, but Cuban officials accused of him being part of a U.S. government plot to destabilize the island's single-party Communist government. Cuba has highly restricted Internet access, and most people are not able to access the Web in their homes or on their phones. On December 17, 2014, Gross was freed, along with three Cuban intelligence agents and a Cuban man convicted of spying for the United States. It was part of a deal between the Cuban and U.S. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of Cold War animosity. Gross, his wife, Judy, his attorney and three U.S. congressmen flew from Havana to his home state of Maryland aboard a U.S. military jet, one of the smaller versions of Air Force One used to transport President Barack Obama. The image of Gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with CNN reporting the news of his release on a TV screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @AlanPGross Twitter page. The night of his release, he enjoyed a meal of spicy Thai food with family and friends, a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison. In January, Gross changed the status of his Facebook page to read that he had left his job as \"hostage\" at the Carlos Finlay military hospital where had been held in Havana. Later, he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in Cuba. With his dental concerns met, he moved on to food. Gross also recounted savoring long-denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese. Many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence: Gross renewing an expired driver's license or visiting a Starbucks for the first time in five years. But in other posts, he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in Israel, seeing the snow fall in Washington and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the Internet. A spokeswoman for Gross turned down a CNN request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat representing the Maryland district Gross hails from, called it \"incredibly moving\" that a man who spent five years in a Cuban prison has since sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and met the pope. More than that, he's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in Washington and Havana. \"Alan did not ask for this special role in history,\" Van Hollen said, \"but he's become a catalyst for this new chapter in American and Cuban relations.\" The photos that Gross posted online show a smiling man, slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison, no longer the gaunt-faced, hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in Cuba. \"The distance we've come since December 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey,\" Gross wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. \"For which we're grateful.\"", "candidates": [["Former US State Department subcontractor Alan Gross has been living a normal life since his release from a Cuban prison three months ago.

And the rules are expected to become law after a full European Parliament in April. The plans were first proposed last May, and in June 2014 the EU passed guidelines that required all members to have the technology ready to handle eCalls set up by October 2017. At the time of the original proposals the Government said the gadget will add at least \u00a3100 to the cost of vehicles. The technology contains a mobile phone-like SIM card designed to transmit the vehicle\u2019s location to emergency services in the event of a crash. It is fitted inside a 'black box' built into the vehicle. An SOS button near the dashboard, linked to a SIM card, allows drivers to call 999 quickly. And if airbags are deployed it automatically sends a text message to emergency services with the car\u2019s location - as well as its unique vehicle ID number.

The SNP could enter a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with Labour, under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities.", "article": "Alex Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration. Alex Salmond has threatened to bring down a Conservative minority government, even if David Cameron wins more seats than Ed Miliband. The former Scottish First Minister said the Scottish National Party would vote down a Tory Queen's Speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election. Latest polls suggest the SNP will gain dozens of seats in Scotland, depriving Labour of a majority and able to call the shots in Westminster. Mr Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration. The Tories said it was proof the SNP would'sabotage the democratic will of the British people' to install Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Speaking to the New Statesman magazine, Mr Salmond said the SNP could enter a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with Labour - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities. But he said it was more probable that it would offer its support on a vote-by-vote basis and would make amendments to any budget put forward by Ed Balls to introduce 'progressive tax measures'. With opinion polls suggesting the SNP are headed for dozens of gains from Labour and the Liberal Democrats north of the border, Mr Salmond - who is standing in the Gordon seat being vacated by veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce - would say only that he expects the party to win 'a barrel-load' of seats at Westminster. He predicted that Lib Dems would not be 'a big factor' in negotiations on forming the new government, as 'if the Liberals are reduced to half their MPs the last thing they're going to be doing is going into a coalition'. 'The surviving half will want to survive,' he said. This would mean the SNP, unionist parties from Northern Ireland and other smaller parties would be crucial to the outcome. Mr Salmond rejected Labour's argument that the party with the most seats after the May 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government, insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the Commons. 'The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we'd be voting against,' said Mr Salmond. 'So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that's Cameron locked out.\u00a0And then under the (Fixed-Term) Parliaments Act that the Westminster parliament's passed but nobody seems to have read, you'd then have a two-week period to form another government - and of course you want to form another government because this might be people's only chance to form another government.' The SNP would act to prop up a Labour government with Ed Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron wins more seats. Although Mr Cameron would remain incumbent Prime Minister until a new government was formed, the Act - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result, said Mr Salmond. The former SNP leader said he had 'no idea' whether a Labour government emerging from such a process would have Mr Miliband as its leader, and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the SNP so firmly. 'If I were him, I wouldn't have ruled it out,' said Mr Salmond. 'Nicola (Sturgeon, the SNP leader) has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely. But she didn't rule it out: she said it was highly unlikely... It's still highly unlikely.' Asked what he saw as the probable outcome, Mr Salmond said: 'I think probable would be vote-by-vote (support for Labour), and possible would be confidence and supply.' A new poll of voters in Scotland this week put Labour down to just 27 per cent, which\u00a0Professor John Curtice says could leave the party with just two MPs, the same number as the Tories. Mr Salmond said it was 'bad politics' for Mr Cameron to float the prospect of English votes for English laws on the morning after last year's independence referendum and said it was now 'not a question of if, but when' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the UK would take place. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. 'That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune. The only way to protect Trident, keep Britain together and safeguard the economy is to vote Conservative.'", "candidates": [["The former Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, has suggested that the Scottish National Party (SNP) would bring down a Conservative minority government if it holds the balance of power after the general election.

{"abstract": "A new study conducted at Duke University Medical Center has found that a dose of tetanus vaccine can help patients with glioblastoma, the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor, live longer when added to an experimental treatment. Sandra Hilburn, a retiree from New Jersey who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2006, was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of the study and is still alive nine years later. While the study was small, brain cancer experts unconnected with the work were impressed and called the results promising.", "article": "When Sandra Hilburn was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2006, she was told she only had up to three months to live. Nine years - and five grandchildren - later, the 68-year-old retiree from New Jersey is still going strong, and all thanks to an experimental treatment involving a common vaccine. Hillburn, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the Duke University Medical Center. Researchers found that a dose of tetanus vaccine let patients like Hillburn live longer when added to an experimental treatment for the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor,. Beating the odds: In April 2006, when Sandy Hillburn was diagnosed with glioblastoma - the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor - she was given only two-three months to live. Matriarch: Thanks to an experimental treatment involving the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine, Hillburn (top center) got to witness the birth of five more grandchildren. It 'put the immune system on high alert,' paving the way for the experimental treatment to work better in attacking the disease, said researcher Kristen Batich of the Duke University Medical Center. In a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature, she and others describe a study of 12 patients. Some who got the tetanus shot lived years longer than those who didn't. Dr. John Sampson of Duke, senior author of the report, called the results promising but noted the study was small, and said bigger studies are needed to confirm the results.  A follow-up study has already been planned but isn't recruiting patients yet, Batich said. Brain cancer experts unconnected with the work were impressed. The results are'very exciting,' said Dr. Nader Sanai of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. While he agreed more work is required, 'what you have so far, it's a very positive story.' Tetanus is otherwise known as lockjaw.  Vaccines for it are routinely recommended for children and adults. The new study focused on glioblastoma, which killed Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2009. Even after surgery to remove the tumor, it usually grows back and kills. The few drugs to treat these tumors have little effect. Half of patients die within about 15 months. When diagnosed in New York in April 2006, 'I was told I had two to three months to live,' Sandra Hillburn recalled in a telephone interview. But her family flew her to Duke in North Carolina because of its reputation for glioblastoma care, and she was offered a slot in the experimental study. Cutting age treatment: Hillburn was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the Duke University Medical Center. New approach:\u00a0Doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in the tumor. Then they return the cells to the patient's body, where they train the immune system to go after the cancer cells and kill them. 'I was very positive it would help,' Hillburn said. 'I said, \"Sure, thank you.\" I'm still saying thank you.' In the years since then, she has attended her son's wedding and gained five more grandchildren. Now she plays soccer with six grandsons in Ohio and Boston. 'I look forward to seeing the wonderful people they're becoming,' she said. She continues to visit Duke once a month for more cell injections. Last November, she celebrated her 100th treatment. Dr Sampson said it's not clear why she has lived so long. Hillburn credits the treatment and her medical care at Duke. She also cited the example of her father, who is a 97-year-old survivor of two kinds of cancer. 'He just went about his life, and so I did the same thing,' Hillburn said. At age 68, Hillburn, plans to continue beating the odds for years to come. 'I think I'm good for at least another 10 years,' she told CBS News. Living by example: Hillburn said her father is a 97-year-old survivor of two different types of cancer who continues to go about living his life, and she is doing the same. Looking ahead:\u00a0She continues to visit Duke once a month for more cell injections and hopes to celebrate her 80th birthday. Positive outlook: Hillburn said when she was offered to be in the study, she was sure the experimental treatment would help. The active senior says she is lucky because she can enjoy a normal life: play golf, take long walks every day and meet friends for lunch. The new research work that has so dramatically prolonged Sandy Hillburn's life is an example of a long-standing effort to harness the immune system to fight cancer, an approach called immunotherapy. The specific strategy it used is called a dendritic-cell vaccine.

It was very hard to keep her attention at the moment,\" Sawyer told CNN's Erin Burnett. \" And she was covered in blood. It was one of the most horrific crime scenes I have seen.\" The officer grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to find where she was injured. Michelle Wilkins was weak and in shock when police arrived. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. \"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,\" Sawyer said. \"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now.\" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. \"When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it.\" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. \"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,\" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, \"She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.\" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who \"saved her own life.\" The fetus died, but the mother survived and \"is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,\" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, \"We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.\" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.", "candidates": [["Pregnant woman was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out after responding to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale.

Scroll down for video. Terrifying footage has emerged of a young tourist who encountered a near-drowning experience. The 27-year-old told Daily Mail Australia he was holidaying Down Under four years ago at the age of 23 when this incident happened. 'I was actually treading the water waiting for my friends to join for over a minute very comfortably before the video was shot,' he said. 'The waves were just choppy - not really particularly scary but it was very much a case of bad timing.' When he showed his mother the footage after returning home, he said the video brought tears to her eyes. 'Mum started crying, whoops,' Orr told Daily Mail Australia. 'At one point when I was in the water, I realized I was in trouble and I was like \"my mum is going to be pissed!\" Patrick Orr, from  Massachusetts, posted a video of himself being swept through the rough tides Down Under. As friends watched helplessly, a young woman, who was filming the moment through a camera phone, is heard screaming at the group of male friends: 'Don't go yet! Wait don't go!' 'Holy s***! Duck! Oh my f*****g god! Pat! Pat!' as she tells Orr to dive under the waves. 'Oh my god - you guys - now I'm freaking out!' the woman frantically said. 'Get the f*** out of there!' Struggling to escape to safety, Orr is seen being swept through the massive waves as he makes his way towards the cliff while more voices are heard  screaming and yelling out directions. As he gets closer to the cliff, Orr attempts to climb his way up the rocks but is seen being wiped out and knocked back into the water a number of times. Two male friends are seen standing at the edge of the cliff as they try to help Orr out but he gets flung back into the waves. The woman continues screaming as she says: 'Pat, oh my god, Pat. Okay that's not funny anymore' before switching off the record button. A group of male friends were waiting to get their turn to jump off the rocks and join their friend in the water. Fortunately, Orr made it clear in the caption that he managed to get to safety and escaped with minor injuries. The footage, which was filmed on a camera phone, was uploaded onto YouTube on Friday and has attracted more than 4000 views. 'Apparently it's a very common place to jump off the rocks and go swimming, but as we weren't locals we didn't realize that the water is usually completely flat and calm,' the caption said. 'Unfortunately, about thirty seconds after I jumped in while waiting for the other wimps to finally join me, a huge wave set hit.' Fortunately, Orr made it clear in the caption that he managed to get to escape safely with only minor injuries. 'Luckily, right after the video cuts out I climbed out and puked everywhere in safety.

Nicola Holding was described as a 'pillar of the community' for her role at St Boniface's church and pre-school in Plymouth, Devon. But she was secretly siphoning off money from church funds and spending it on herself, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Holding, 50, pleaded guilty to fraud two years ago, but repeatedly failed to turn up to be sentenced, blaming a variety of serious illnesses. Jailed: Nicola Holding has been sentenced to prison for stealing from the church where she was treasurer. Yesterday she was finally sentenced to two and a half years in prison after arriving at court in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets. She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes. Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen \u00a390,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just \u00a324,000. She said \u00a37,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and \u00a36,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school. In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow said:\u201d 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.\u201d' Victims: The congregation at St Boniface's church in Plymouth were betrayed by the fraud, a court heard. He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home. Jo Martin, defending, said: \u201c'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.\u201d'She said Holding would find prison life '\u2018extraordinarily difficult'\u2019 because of her ailments. Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes. 'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said. 'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults. \u201c'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave.

Republicans have attacked Mrs Clinton after it emerged that during her time as Secretary of State she used her own private email account to conduct official business. However an investigation by NBC news has uncovered evidence that Republican front-runner Jeb Bush used his own private email server while Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who also has White House aspirations, employed a similar system. Scroll down for video. Hillary Clinton, pictured on a C-17 military aircraft using her Blackberry, used a personal email address while Secretary of State provoking criticism that she was attempting to avoid proper scrutiny of her messages. Following the controversy involving Clinton, it has emerged that Jeb Bush and his staff used a private email server for some official correspondence, however many of these messages have been made public. In an effort to reduce the impact of the controversy, Mrs Clinton has released 55,000 email documents from her personal files to the government to determine whether she had sent any classified information using her personal server during her time as Secretary of State. State Department rules insist that non-classified but sensitive national security or diplomatic information can only be transmitted using secure servers. According to CNN, the Florida governor used an email address on his own jeb.org server for official and personal business. However, he has now released hundreds of thousands of emails in an effort to deflect criticism. Mrs Clinton is the 6/5 favourite to become the next resident of 1600 Pennsylvania \u00a0Avenue, while Jeb Bush is the most favoured Republican at 5/2 with Scott Walker trailing at 14/1, according to bookmakers Paddy Power. CNN claimed that there is now evidence that Jeb Bush and his staff used his personal email server to communicate while working on official Florida business. Scott Walker's spokeswoman attacked Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, even though he was forced to admit using a similar system while in office as a Milwaukee County executive. Kirsten Kukowski, who represents Walker's political committee, Our American Revival, said: 'Hillary Clinton's potential evasion of laws is something she should answer questions about. 'Wisconsin has a strong open records law with a broad presumption of access to records and the governor has very specific policies in place in his office to assure that the laws are complied with fully.' Two of Walker's associates were convicted of political campaigning on government time. Fellow Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker, pictured, has also been embroiled in the scandal. Tens of thousands of pages of emails collected by prosecutors as part of that investigation have been publicly released since the close of the probe. Walker was never charged or convicted as a result of the investigation. Walker's staff has said that no such secret network exists in the governor's office. And Walker said last year that when he became governor in 2011 he created a 'clear distinction between things that are political and official'. He insisted that in November 2011, after almost a year in office he introduced a policy that 'any campaign work should be done away from the Capitol or state office building', with staffers using their 'own phone, computer and personal email'. Clinton's email server, clintonemail.com was used in the aftermath of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate in the Libyan city Benghazi. A House of Representatives Select Committee is investigating the attack and has issued a subpoena for any emails concerning Libya on Clinton's personal servers. According to Jamal D. Ware, spokesman for the Select Committee: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation. 'The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.' Later Ware confirmed: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi is in possession of records with two separate and distinct email addresses used by former Secretary Clinton and dated during the time she was Secretary of State. 'Without access to the relevant electronic information and stored data on the server\u2014which was reportedly registered to her home\u2014there is no way the Committee, or anyone else, can fully explain why the Committee uncovered two email addresses. 'As Chairman Gowdy has noted, this is why former Secretary Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of personal emails to conduct official U.S. government business is so problematic and raises significant issues for transparency. The American people have a right to a full accounting of all the former Secretary\u2019s emails, and the Committee is committed to working to uncover all the facts.' Current Secretary of State John Kerry said his department is currently assessing the 55,000 documents released by Clinton vowing \u00a0that they \u00a0'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way'.

It also imagined that the far-Right leader Marine Le Pen was the president of France and had declared a state of emergency. But last night it emerged that the production company that made it had received EU funding to translate the film and dub it into different languages, so it can be shown in various member states. Eurosceptic MPs accused the BBC of showing \u2018EU propaganda\u2019. Brian Binley, a Tory backbencher, said: \u2018I think it\u2019s disgraceful. Here is the EU Commission propagating itself throughout Europe. That is simply unacceptable. It is not a governing institution\u2019s job to use taxpayers\u2019 money to perpetuate itself. It is not the job of the commissioners who run the EU budget to perpetrate their vision.\u2019 The 75-minute film presented an apocalyptic vision of what would happen if the EU (pictured at the EU leaders at the 2014 Wales Nato Summit_ were to fall apart. The film, presented by journalist Bill Emmott, starred comedian Angus Deayton as an archaeologist explaining the single currency to a young girl on an aeroplane heading for Berlin, after the collapse of the EU and the abolition of the euro. Mr Deayton laid out \u2013 with \u2018flashbacks\u2019 to 2014 \u2013 the reasons for the EU break-up. The film\u2019s production company, Springshot Productions, said it was depicting \u2018a Europe that is sleepwalking towards disaster\u2019, and claimed the film showed that the EU was \u2018well worth saving\u2019. It created \u2018a unique, choral portrait of the European dream and how it could be lost forever\u2019. Director Annalisa Piras, an Italian journalist, said it would be shown on a \u2018Europe-wide tour\u2019 of universities. But Ukip MP Mark Reckless, who appeared in a panel discussion with Mr Emmott after last night\u2019s programme, said he had confirmed EU funding was used to make the film. Mr Reckless said: \u2018I asked him if he had received any EU money for it when we appeared on the panel together, and he said they had \u2013 for translation into different languages.

I think he also put in some of his own money and they had other sources of funding for other elements of the film.\u2019 Last night on Twitter, Mr Emmott said the production company had received \u2018EU top-up for language versions\u2019.

Antonio Boporan Singh, 28, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder after two men were punched, kicked and one was hit with a champagne glass at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar. Singh, heir to a \u00a3130million chicken fortune, has already served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road in November 2006. Scroll down for video. Antonio Boparan Singh, right, pictured with his food tycoon father Ranjit, right at an earlier court appearance. The 28-year-old has been sentenced to a year in jail after attacking a man in a brutal bar attack. His latest jail sentence comes after a brawl at the upmarket Birmingham bar last April. During the fight, one victim, Jarondeep Kooner, was slashed across the face with a champagne flute by Theodore Mullings-Fairweather, who then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the man as he lay injured on the floor. Singh from Little Aston, West Midlands - who earlier paid \u00a3400 to secure a VIP table at the bar - left the club with Mullings-Fairweather and alongside Edward Ansah and Nathan Pringle. But as they walked into a nearby street the group saw a 31-year-old man with his shirt ripped. Assuming him to be part of the group involved in the fight, Mullings-Fairweather and Singh punched and kicked him to the ground before running off. The minute-long attack was captured on CCTV and left both victims, Harprit Singh and Mr Kooner, requiring hospital treatment. Mr Kooner, 22, suffered a fractured eye socket and has since lost use of an eye. Two men were punched, kicked and one hit with a champagne flute in the attack last April at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar, pictured. Singh had pleaded guilty to one count of inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder at Birmingham Crown Court in February, and was given one year in jail on Friday. Mullings-Fairweather, 25, from Selly Oak, Birmingham admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was jailed for eight years. He also received another eight years for a separate offence of robbery after stealing a cash box from outside a Tesco store. Singh's father Ranjit Singh Boparan owns 2 Sisters Food Group - a Birmingham-based food-manufacturing company. Established in 1993 as a frozen retail cutting operation, it has grown rapidly and expanded to cover 36 manufacturing sites in the UK, eight in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and one in Poland. The group employs 23,000 people, and has annual sales of \u00a33.4billion. It is listed 14th on the 2014 Sunday Times Top Track 100. The company is now the third largest food company in the UK by turnover. Brands include Fox's Biscuits, Goodfella's, Donegal Catch and Green Isle. Harry Ramsden's was sold to Boparan Ventures Ltd in 2010, the private investment branch of his business empire. Pringle, 32, from Erdington, Birmingham, and Ansah, 24, from Sutton Coldfield, both admitted violent disorder and were given 18 months imprisonment. Addressing Singh, Judge Simon Drew QC said: 'The assault occasioning actual bodily harm took place after the violent assault and should be considered entirely separate and was a gratuitous attack. 'It involved you kicking a man on the ground to the head. These courts regard that conduct as very serious.' Michael Wolkind, defending, said Singh had not been drinking that night and said he led a 'cautious' lifestyle. He added the 28-year-old had dedicated his life to the Boparan Charitable Trust, which helps sick children. After the hearing, Detective Constable Allan Jones, who led the inquiry, said: 'This was a violent attack which devastated the lives of two young men. 'Both needed extensive medical treatment and the 22-year-old has suffered permanent sight loss as a result of this group's actions. Singh had previously been jailed for 21 months for hitting the car Cerys Edwards was in while overtaking at 70mph in a 30mph area in November 2006. The youngster, now nine-years-old, was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive. Speaking after the sentencing, the father of Cerys's father, Gareth, 50, from Sutton Coldfield said: 'I think his sentence is very lenient considering his previous conviction.

Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday.

Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said his office would not seek a murder charge against Lane, according to KTLA. Scroll down for video.

Victim Michelle\u00a0Wilkins, 26, was released from hospital on Wednesday and her family said\u00a0she is taking the first tentative steps in a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation.

{"abstract": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz has announced his candidacy for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. Cruz is known for his extreme right-wing views and his campaign will test the conventional wisdom that such a strategy is a failure. However, the chances of Cruz winning the presidency are not great, as even in primaries, Republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in November.", "article": "(CNN)Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will announce Monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president. Cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012. His announcement takes place at a bastion of  conservatism, Liberty University, the institution founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. Cruz is going to run from the right. He has spent much of his short career in Washington blasting the \"mushy middle\" of his party (which might be news to most Democrats), which he dismisses as a \"failed electoral strategy.\" During a recent visit to New Hampshire, where he vowed to eliminate the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue Service, Cruz said that \"I'm pretty sure, here in New Hampshire, y'all define gun control like we do in Texas: Gun control is when you hit at what you aim at.\" Fifty years ago, another Republican senator ran this kind of campaign, Arizona's Barry Goldwater, who took on President Lyndon Johnson. Cruz will test the conventional wisdom that Goldwater's strategy was and remains a failure. When Republicans voted to nominate him in 1964, Goldwater told the delegates that \"extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue.\" When the icon of moderate Republicans, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, spoke to the convention, the delegates hissed and booed. The outcome was far from great for the GOP. Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal Democratic majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred. Although Goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964, Cruz thinks that the times have changed. Is he right? Right now, the chances are not great. If Cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism, he faces very long odds of making it to the White House. The strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against Jeb Bush in red states, but it is not an approach with a great track record. Even as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades, Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination, and those who have also won the presidency, always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes. Ronald Reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent, and George H.W. Bush had a thousand points of light. His son George W. Bush emphasized policies tied to \"compassionate conservatism\" to prove that he was not an extreme zealot. Even Republicans who didn't win in the general elections, like John McCain and Mitt Romney, did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base. Notwithstanding the conventional wisdom, even in primaries it seems that Republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in November. This coming election will be tough for Republicans. As all the experts have shown, the electoral college math does not favor the GOP. Some experts have predicted that Democrats have over an 80% chance of winning the Electoral College. According to the Washington Post, if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election, five currently favor Democrats (Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania) while in others, like Colorado, Democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends, namely growing minority populations that favor their party's nominee. Barring any dramatic changes in the coming months, Democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in Hillary Clinton. Cruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate. The Republican Party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in Washington. In 2014, congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14%. As the new year began, the approval ratings were only slightly better: just 16%. This is the congressional Republicanism where Cruz comes from. Many voters who like conservatism and the GOP don't love what their representatives are doing on Capitol Hill. The kind of scorched earth, always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings. There have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as Cruz. During his campaign for the presidency, he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in Congress. When Goldwater squared off against Johnson in 1964, the President predicted that there would be a \"frontlash\" of Republican and independent voters who would move way from the GOP just because Goldwater was at the top of the ticket. This was Johnson's response to predictions of a backlash in the South from Democrats who were angry about civil rights. The frontlash, Johnson explained to Bill Moyers is \"liberals, independents, moderate Republicans.\" The electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in Midwestern states in 1964, where solidly Republican areas went Democratic because they were scared off by Goldwater, but a Cruz campaign could be exactly what Democrats", "candidates": [["Cruz will announce his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president on Monday.

{"abstract": "Scientists have discovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young, dating back at least 100 million years. The fossil shows a female sap-sucking scale insect carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen, and is thought to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered. The discovery may help to explain how parental care first began to emerge and offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects.", "article": "It is a tender moment frozen in time for at least 100 million years. Scientists have uncovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young. The fossil shows a female sap-sucking scale insect, preserved in amber, carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen. The waxy ball like shapes on the abdomen of this 100 million year old insect Wathondra kotejai contain eggs and hatched nymphs and is thought  to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered. The fossil, discovered in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar, pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years. It is thought to be one of the earliest examples of parental care ever discovered and may help to explain how it first began to emerge. Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive \u2013 and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool. Researchers at the University of Missouri exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms. Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes. Based on the gene analysis, the scientists found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly. There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it. Professor Bo Wang, a palaeontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the research, said: 'Brood care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects, which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous period during the Mesozoic era. 'Although analysis seemed to suggest that ancient insects evolved brood care, this is the first direct, unequivocal evidence for the fossil record.' The insect Wathondra kotejai is thought to date from the mid-Cretaceous period and became encased in sap from a tree that over time turned into amber. Around its abdomin are around 60 eggs and freshly hatched nymphs, encased within a wax-coated egg sack, according to the research, which is published in the journal eLife. This primitive form of brood care would have protected the young nymphs from wet and dry conditions while allowing them to mature in the relative safety of their mother. Fossilised evidence of animals caring for their young is extremely rare, especially in insects. Wingless females were largely immobile, so were less likely to be accidentally buried. A cockroach from a similar period was reported carrying a mass of eggs, but cockroaches often deposit their eggs rather than brooding them. This drawing of a brooding female Wathondara kotejai shows the ovisac containing the brood and eggs coated in a wax covering as a lumpy mass on the main part of the insects body. Amber makes it almost transparent. Researchers believe Wathondara kotejai (above) may be one of the earliest insects to care for its young. Tiny hatched nymphs can be seen scattered aaround the mother insect's body in the amber in the image above. The only other direct evidence of brood care is from Cenozoic ambers, which are thought to only extend to around 65 million years ago. The latest discovery is thought to be at least 100 million years ago and dates from a time when dinosaurs dominated the Earth. The findings may help to offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects - small limpet-like suck saping insects that are common pests on plants today. The emergence of flowing plants and ants are thought to have been crucial for the rapid evolution of many new inspect species but were not present when scale insects began to evolve. Today many insects, such as ants and bees, care for their young, while the behaviour is far less common in mammals where just six per cent of species care for their young.

But we\u2019ll do our best to help,\u2019 he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Woodland said Stuart was in very good hands, as the Diver family has once again surrounded him amid the tragedy and were providing vital support to him and young daughter, Alessia. 'All the family are around him. Euan his brother, his parents Steve and Annette, they are a close family and very, very strong,' he said. 'I can't foretell, by any means, how he will deal with this (after) but the whole family is a great family, they are very, very strong in their personalities and their characters. 'They are all strong, they have been mountain climbing when the boys were young, and it was the whole strength of the family that made Stuart the person he is. 'They are lovely people and my wife looked after (Stuart's mother) Annette while they were in Canberra.' The Thredbo disaster of 1997 killed Stuart's then wife Sally and 17 others. He only emerged from his dark, private hell after almost three days. Stuart Diver and Rosanna Cossettini married on April 13, 2002 in a ceremony in the Snowy Mountains when she was 27 and he was 32. In a heartbreaking turn of events, Rosanna was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer just three weeks after their nuptials but went into remission. Sadly, the cancer had returned by July, 2013. She passed away on Saturday aged 40. The miracle moment: Stuart Diver is pulled from the rubble of the Thredbo ski village after surviving almost three days under the rubble. The landslide killed 18 people including his first wife Sally. He survived despite suffering hypothermia and blood poisoning in the below freezing conditions. Sally and Stuart pictured on their wedding day. Stuart Diver told of his deep despair after losing his wife in the disaster, but as time past he also believed Sally would have wanted him to get on with his life and be happy. Stuart Diver at the release of his book 'Survival'. He also wrote that 'I had always believed that if it was right in your heart, then it was right,' he wrote of finding love after Sally's tragic passing. With Rosanna, I found myself loving again' Stuart remains an ardent supporter of the Salvation Army, as a result of their friendship, and has actively promoted the charity. Don Woodland has never lost contact with his good friend Stuart and believes the survival instincts and strength he displayed to get through more than 65 harrowing hours under the rubble of the Thredbo's Bimbadeen and Carinya Lodges, will help him through the sorrow of losing Rosanna to cancer. \u2018I was at Thredbo and went through that", "candidates": [["The retired Salvation Army chaplain Don Woodland has been called on to help Stuart Diver bury his second wife Rosanna, whom he considers \"closer than a brother\".

Scroll down for video. A health care worker prepares a colleague's Ebola virus protective gear at a clinic operated by the International Medical Corps in Makeni, Sierra Leone. \u00a0Five people in the U.S. are now being monitored after being exposed to Ebola. The person is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization. The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November. This came as a second American health care worker who was possibly exposed to Ebola has been moved to Nebraska Medicine's biocontainment unit after a change in symptoms, the hospital said on Monday. The worker was one of four monitored in Nebraska after exposure to another American who tested positive for Ebola.\u00a0The person who was moved has not tested positive for the virus, the hospital said. None of the patients has been identified. The hospital said it would receive a fifth person who was part of the initial exposure in Sierra Leone later on Monday. The latest NIH patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. Two patients in the U.S. have died: a man treated in Dallas after contracting the virus in Africa and a doctor evacuated from Africa to Nebraska when he was already critically ill. The man in Dallas had contracted the virus in his native Liberia. He transmitted the disease to two nurses, resulting in widespread concern in the U.S., with questions raised about emergency department screening of patients, monitoring of ill travelers from Africa and even disputes over the disposal of potentially infectious waste from hospitals. The World Health Organization has estimated the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease. While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring. That includes four going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday. On Saturday, four health care workers arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and three arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda. One of those being monitored in Nebraska has developed symptoms of Ebola and was being moved to a biocontainment unit, hospital officials said in a news release on Monday. However, none of those being monitored has tested positive for Ebola. The National Institutes of Health said it has no other pending admissions of additional patients with the Ebola virus or who have been exposed to Ebola. CDC workers in Sierra Leone are involved in investigating the illness of the first patient, including looking for other people the person was in contact with. It's possible other people will be transported to the United States for monitoring, said the spokesman, Tom Skinner.=.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised Welbeck's mental strength and team spirit, while also paying tribute to the 9,000 travelling Arsenal fans who attended the match.", "article": "Louis van Gaal admitted he had not prepared for the possibility of matchwinner Danny Welbeck facing his former club at Old Trafford. The Manchester United manager, under pressure after this dramatic 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup quarter-final, expected Olivier Giroud to spearhead the Arsenal attack. Instead Welbeck scored Arsenal's glorious 61st minute winner when he clipped the ball beyond David de Gea and ran on to score in front of 9,000 travelling Arsenal supporters. Danny Welbeck slides the ball into an empty net to secure a 2-1 win for Arsenal against Manchester United. The former United striker celebrates in front of Arsenal's 9,000 travelling supporters at Old Trafford. Van Gaal, who sold Welbeck to Arsenal in the summer because he didn't believe he was good enough, said: 'In football it happens, but it was also a surprise that Wenger put him in that position. 'When a player returns to play his former club he will always be very motivated, but we gave the goal away. 'It is very disappointing because we gave the victory to Arsenal. The players are disappointed because they know it could have been different. 'This is a big blow, we have to recover. We are sportsmen so we have to recover. I cannot say that the motivation of the team was bad. 'We have to show fantastic fighting spirit, that is not the problem.' United finished with ten men after the dismissal of Angel di Maria in the second half. He was booked by referee Michael Oliver - who had an outstanding game - for diving and was then shown another yellow card for tugging at the official's shirt. Van Gaal added: 'Di Maria knows that he doesn't have to touch the referee. That is not so smart of him. Angel di Maria is shown a red card by referee Michael Oliver after picking up two bookings inside a minute. Di Maria heads for the Old Trafford tunnel after a moment of madness cost him a second yellow card. 'But controlled emotion is not so easy in a match like this, but I mentioned it before the game because I know these red cards are easily given. 'I cannot give a comment about the referee and you know why. He knows that he doesn't have to touch the referee. 'We have to see every decision of the referee in the circumstances because he whistles, but I want to see the video tape to see how he has decided it all.' Arsenal took the lead here when Nacho Monreal ended a brilliant move by Wenger's side in the 25th minute, but Wayne Rooney equalised four minutes later. The FA Cup holders, who will now play Bradford or Reading in the FA Cup semi-final, went on to score again when Welbeck read a disastrous backpass by Antonio Valencia. Welbeck barely celebrated his goal, his eighth for Arsenal since his move from United, but Wenger insisted he had added motivation to score. The Arsenal manager said: 'He has pace, he also has a bit of psychological consideration by playing against his old club, and I have to rotate a bit without affecting the players. Louis van Gaal and his assistant Ryan Giggs gesture on the touchline during United's defeat by Arsenal. Van Gaal opted to sell matchwinner Welbeck to Arsenal for \u00a316million in last summer's transfer window. 'I thought we might need to counter attack, so I played him. He has had a great game. 'We want everyone to do well against their former club to show they are great players, but it is not aways easy to deal mentally with it. 'I only knew very late that he would play, but he has shown great mental strength. 'He just wants to win, he is a team player. He just wants to do well and he wants to produce s complete performance. 'He kept calm and De Gea made one or two outstanding saves.' Arsenal deserved to win and Wenger insisted that his team can respond to the challenge ahead as they target a sixth FA Cup since he became manager of the club. He also paid tribute to the 9,000 travelling Arsenal fans who made their way to Old Trafford on a Monday evening for this FA Cup quarter-final. Some of Arsenal's 9,000 travelling fans celebrate at Old Trafford after the final whistle. Van Gaal trudges towards the tunnel after seeing his side miss out on a place in the FA Cup semi-finals. He said: 'We started at a high tempo and without apprehension. We were in control. We could have scored more. 'The team was a bit down at 1-1 at half-time, because we felt that we should be winning. 'Mentally we were at the level I requested. It was a physical game, a committed game. We did that well without forgetting to play our football. 'Every win makes us stronger.

Scroll down for video. Kirstie Allsopp, pictured above in her Notting Hill home, is a household name for her thrifty interior ideas. And it should come as no surprise, as the face of shows such as Kirstie's Homemade Home and Location, Location, Location, the property expert knows a thing or two about transforming a living space. She and her partner Ben Andersen bought their London house, a 1950s property, in September 2006, a few months after her first son Bay, now nine, was born and set about turning it into a home. Talking about her house, which was once two flats which have been knocked together to create an open and airy family home, Miss Allsopp, 43, who also has a son Oscar, seven, and is step-mother to Ben's two sons, said: 'I can't think of anything that hasn't got some sort of story behind it. 'Someone asked me if I designed all this, but it's not like that. It comes together over time. You get things all the time and you are adding and taking things away.'

Ben got them years ago, before he met me even. They weren't always here. He doesn't like buying new sofas so we just sort of move things around. But I am actually going to have to basically get either a new sofa or swap this for another type of sofa soon.' 'Once you know you're not going to just buy something new, once you've made that decision \u2013 and I hate calling it an ethical decision because that makes it sound like you are really up your own bottom, but we have made an active decision not to go out and buy new things. That decision has been made.' The 'Blue Peter' fire place. 'I was pregnant with my first child and Ben took me to the Goldborne Road and there was this fireplace that he loved. I burst into tears because I just didn't know what else to do. It was a disgraceful performance on my behalf. 'I wept \"please no, let's not buy that fireplace\"'. I was so ashamed at my lack of backbone. \"I really don't think we should buy this fireplace\", I kept saying. I was so ashamed of myself. 'I bought the fireplace for a lot of money. I said to Ben \"I've bought the fireplace, when you have a building which needs a new fireplace and everything else, you can put it in and you are bound to need it at some point. I'm sorry I cried, it's a beautiful fireplace.

Farkhunda, 27, was pushed from a roof, run over by a car and set on fire before her body was thrown in the Kabul River - in full view of several policeman - last Thursday. On Sunday, grieving women carried the religious scholar's coffin through the streets of the Afghan capital in a dramatic departure from local custom. Pallbearers are traditionally men. It comes as protesters wearing masks of  Farkhunda's bloodied face have marched on Kabul to demand justice for the young teacher. In unprecedented scenes grieving women in the Afghan capital of Kabul have carried the coffin of a woman savagely beaten to death after being wrongly accused of burning the Koran. Afghan women's rights activists carry the coffin of 27-year-old Farkhunda, who was beaten to death by an angry all-male mob in broad daylight in central Kabul on Thursday. A picture of Farkhunda, who was brutally murdered for allegedly burning a copy of the Koran, is seen during her funeral ceremony. A leading investigator has today said that there is no evidence to support the claims that the 27-year-old Islamic studies teacher had burned the Koran. In the city, men are traditionally pallbearers and the sight of only women carrying a coffin marks an extraordinary break with custom. Afghan women's rights activists mourn during the funeral ceremony.\u00a0Members of Farkhunda's family have denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation. Senior police officials have since confirmed that they believe the Koran-burning allegations that prompted the attack were false. Members of Farkhunda's family have denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation. Her father said the 27-year-old worked as an Islamic studies teacher studies and could recite the Koran by heart. He insisted she was not involved in burning the Muslim holy book. 'Farkhunda was a deeply religious girl. She used to recite the holy Koran and pray five times a day,' her brother Najeebullah Malikzada said today. Protesters who gathered near the Shah Doshamshera mosque today demanded the government prosecute all those responsible for the death of Farkhunda, who like many Afghans used only one name.

Protesters who gathered near the Shah Doshamshera mosque today demanded the government prosecute all those responsible for the death of Farkhunda, who like many Afghans used only one name. Many women in the crowd wore masks of Farkhunda's battered and bloodied face, which has appeared widely on social media. They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan. Afghan security forces stand guard as youth from the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan protest at the site where a mob beat to death Farkhunda. Farkhunda's body was dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river. Officials said that 26 people have been arrested, and 13 policemen based in the area of the mosque have been suspended amid allegations they stood by and did nothing to stop the attack. One policeman who was present during the attack said the police were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd, which grew throughout the attack. Sayed Habid Shah said that Farkhunda and a fortune teller at the small shrine next to the mosque began arguing, when the fortune teller accused her of burning the Koran. 'She said I am a Muslim and Muslims do not burn the Koran,' Shah \u00a0said. 'As more people gathered, the police were trying to push them away, but it got out of control. 'The people pulled her into a corner of the yard and beat her with sticks, and one man took a large stone and dropped it on her. That was the end,' Shah said. Farkhunda's body was then dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river, he said. Social activists on Monday planted a pine tree on the riverbank spot where Farkhunda's body was set alight.

And, with Ireland's visit to the Millennium Stadium on March 14 shaping up to be the game that could decide the destiny of this year's RBS Six Nations title, McBryde insists Wales will be ready this time. Gordon D'Arcy surges through for Ireland as they beat Wales 26-3 in last year's tournament. Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde has told Ireland not to expect the same Welsh mistakes as last year. 'I know from a coaching point of view we looked at ourselves and weren't happy with the way we prepared for the game that week,' McBryde reflected on Wales' visit to Ireland 13 months ago. 'We did not have the intensity in training leading up to that match and we were exposed on the day. 'We weren't pointing fingers, we were looking at ourselves as to how we could have prepared better for that game. 'It was a bitter pill to swallow because we were well-beaten and it was the first time in a long time that had happened to us. 'We really struggled to cope with their driving game but we've worked worked hard in that area and the boys showed against France what they're capable of doing.'

Wales captain Sam Warburton (centre) is expected to play against Ireland after suffering a knock. But Ireland are three-fifths to a Grand Slam having beaten England in Dublin last weekend and McBryde accepts Wales face a big challenge to record their first win over the men in green since 2012. 'They're a very formidable outfit as they've proven,' McBryde said. 'You've got to have your wits about you playing them in regards to the tactical and technical approach to the game. 'But the France game was a reflection of what the players have been doing in training and some of the execution and accuracy under pressure which we we speak about constantly came to fruition.

Scolded: BBC chairman Rona Fairhead (pictured) was grilled by a group of MPs and her predecessor who called for her to stand down from her post. But Sir Michael, who chaired the BBC's governing body from 2007 to 2011, said her reputation had been damaged. 'She has to ask herself whether, in the substance and process of what she has been through, it has damaged her ability to speak on behalf of the licence fee payer,' he said. 'Is Rona confident she can command public support? If she has any hesitation about that, she can't do the job.' Some MPs took an even tougher line yesterday, lambasting Mrs Fairhead's ability to hold the BBC to account, and calling on her to step down. 'I don't trust her to be right sort of person to do that job,' said John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley. 'She just swallows what she's told and doesn't challenge anything. She's not doing her job. She was not at all convincing. 'One of the problems with cover-ups is that senior directors don't ask questions. The BBC has its own cover-ups and [the HSBC scandal] raises questions about whether Rona is the right person to examine them.' Labour MP Helen Goodman said Mrs Fairhead would have to take action to restore her credibility: 'She needs to give a much better explanation than she did [on Monday] to the public accounts committee and needs to show that her own financial interests will not in any way influence editorial policy.'

'Current indications suggest a delay of between a few days. and several weeks,' a statement from the world's leading. particle physics research centre said on Tuesday. Engineers had been expected to start on Wednesday pumping. proton beams in opposite directions all the way round the two. 27-km (17-mile) underground tubes in the LHC, closed down for. the past two years for a refit. Scroll down for video. The LHC (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at CERN (European particle physics laboratory) near Geneva, Switzerland.   After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, it is about to ramp up for its second three-year run. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. That would have been the prelude to the start of particle. collisions in late May at twice the power of those in the LHC's. first run from 2010-2013. The smashing-together of particles inside the LHC is. designed to mimic conditions just after the Big Bang at the dawn. of the universe. In a breakthrough in 2012, CERN scientists. announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle, a basic. building block of the universe, which appeared to be the boson. imagined and named half a century earlier by theoretical. physicist Peter Higgs. Hopes for the second run lie in breaking out of what it. known as the Standard Model of how the universe works at the. level of elementary particles, and into 'New Physics.' That includes searching for the dark matter that makes up. about 96 percent of the stuff of the universe but can only be. detected by its influence on visible matter around it. CERN scientists expressed disappointment at the last-minute. problem, in just one of the underground machine's eight sectors,. which have been rewired and checked thoroughly during the. closedown. But the research centre's director general, Rolf. Heuer, played down its significance. 'All the signs are good for a great run 2,' he said in a. statement. 'In the grand scheme of things, a few weeks delay in. humankind's quest to understand our universe is little more than. the blink of an eye.' Scientists and engineers at CERN, mindful of a serious. leakage in 2008 which caused a delay of two years in the. start-up for the first LHC run, have long insisted that there. can be no rushing into full operations. Frederick Bordry, director for accelerators, said it could. take time to resolve what he described as an intermittent. short-circuit because it was in a cold section of the machine,. meaning that part would probably have to be warmed up. It would then have to be recooled. 'So what would have taken. hours in a warm machine could end up taking us weeks,' he added. Previously a Higgs particle has been created in an LHC detector and has then disintegrated into four muons (the four red lines). According to Dr Christoffer Petersson's model the Higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter. Scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe. Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May,  accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a Thursday news conference in Geneva. A test beam ran through the collider last weekend, he said. Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment. 'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' CERN General Director Rolf Heuer said. 'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.' Dark matter \u2014 and its cousin, dark energy \u2014 make up most of the universe, yet scientists haven't been able to see them yet, so researchers are looking for them in high-energy crashes, in orbit on a special experiment on the international space station, and in a deep underground mine.

The White House earlier threatened to veto such a measure.", "article": "Washington (CNN)In a strongly worded letter, the White House Saturday told Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) a bill he is drafting would likely have a \"profoundly negative impact\" on the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Corker is working on legislation that would force the Obama Administration to submit any deal reached with Iran for a vote by Congress.  The White House earlier threatened to veto such a measure. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, in the three page letter released publicly Saturday evening, told Corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with Iran by \"emboldening Iranian hard-liners, inviting a counter-productive response from the Iranian majiles (Majles, the Parliament); differentiating the U.S. position from our allies in the negotiations; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal.\" As the U.S. and Iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week, there has been a growing debate between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Obama Administration about how much authority Congress has regarding the fate of the agreement. \"The legislation you have introduced in the Senate goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran. Instead, the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that Congress must vote to 'approve' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the President,\" McDonough wrote. The chief of staff said that only Congress can terminate the existing Iran sanctions that are included in laws, but the President can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally. One of the major issues between the U.S. and Iran is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions. \"If congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal, it will create divisions within the international community, putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure Iran. Put simply, it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions, while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions\" now in place, McDonough said in his letter. For his part, Corker on Sunday released a statement: \"On this issue where Congress has played such a vital role, I believe it is very important that Congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented.\" Corker also urged the President not to go to the United Nations for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on Iran, as Reuters reported was being considered. \"Enabling the United Nations to consider an agreement or portions of it, while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable Congress to do the same, is a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress' appropriate role,\" he wrote. The chief of staff told Corker, \"The Administration's request to the Congress is simple: let us complete the negotiations before the Congress acts on legislation\" and added \"we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the United States.\" McDonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to Iran's leadership and signed by 47 Republican senators. Corker did not sign it. The letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval. It has generated much controversy. It also drew rebuttal from Iran's foreign minister, who called it a propaganda ploy. On Sunday, Iran's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, said the letter signed by the senators tarnished Washington's reputation internationally, according to state-run Tasnim news agency. He said it showed that the United States is untrustworthy, and he advised current negotiators to be wary. McDonough also said the letter's premise was incorrect. \"Non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with Iran...are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval,\" McDonough said. Secretary of State John Kerry, who heads back to Switzerland on Sunday for more talks with Iranian representatives, again blasted that letter from the 47 Republicans. \"It is a direct interference with negotiations in the executive department,\" he said at a news conference in Egypt. \"It is completely without precedent, and it is almost inevitable it will raise questions in the minds of the folks with whom we are negotiating.\"", "candidates": [["In a letter released publicly, the White House warned Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) that a bill he is drafting would likely have a \"profoundly negative impact\" on the ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.

A senior RE teacher was found hanged at a quarry after claiming she was being bullied by other staff members at her secondary school, an inquest heard. Caroline Bailey, 46, worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but became stressed at work and began suffering panic attacks and insomnia. The mother-of-two ended up taking sick leave and made several attempts to self-harm during the school's summer holidays, the inquest in Oldham heard. She was later admitted to a psychiatric unit at Fairfield General Hospital, Greater Manchester. On the day of her death in September 2012, she told staff at the unit that she was going out to buy a newspaper but instead went to Castle Hill Quarry near Rochdale, where she was later found dead. The inquest heard how the tragedy occurred after Ms Bailey was appointed head of humanities at the school, where she was described by the headteacher as an 'outstanding classroom practitioner' who 'always put children first.' The hearing was told how she started talking about self-harm over undisclosed issues she had with a fellow teacher and was eventually prescribed anti-depressants. She became so stressed that she began locking herself in her own classroom to eat lunch at the school instead of joining her colleagues in the staff room. Her husband Neal Connor, 36, said she also began calling herself'stupid' after a fellow teacher was promoted above her and said: 'I have nothing.' Mr Connor, a recovery operator from Prestwich, said: 'She had been suffering from panic attacks while she was at work. She had felt them a couple of times while she was teaching. 'She had also felt the same sort of feeling when she had been in the presence of a couple of other members of staff as well, to the point that since December I noticed she had not been eating properly at home. 'She avoided going to the staff room on multiple occasions because she wanted her own time. She did not want to be in the presence of certain staff. She locked herself in her own class room for dinner. 'She had problems with members of staff at work and in my opinion it was a form of strategic bullying. 'There were ongoing issues from school and they were on her mind. She was made aware that a person was promoted above her position and she came out with comments like 'I have nothing,' and called herself'stupid.' In the months before her death, Ms Bailey was advised by her GP to seek counselling and also paid for her own hypnotherapy sessions. However, she ended up going on sick leave and began self-harming during the school's summer holidays. Neal Connor told the inquest in Oldham that he believed his wife Caroline (together above) was being subjected to'strategic bullying' at the school. He said she called herself'stupid' after a colleague was promoted over her. Following one instance of self-harm, her husband took her to A&E and doctors suggested that she be treated in a psychiatric unit at Fairfield Hospital. However, she begged not to be admitted as it was so close to the school where she worked. Mr Connor said: 'When she got to Fairfield that night she looked like a frightened child. She said she wanted to be anywhere except there. When she walked from the ambulance she was frightened of seeing someone she knew - she looked through every single window to see who was there. 'There were some boys from the school sat at the entrance to Fairfield and her biggest fear was the fact that she had taught there for that long that some of the kids she taught at 15 would be 25. 'The biggest fear would be that they recognised her but she would not recognise them and that it would go out into the community that she was at that sort of ward.' Following the treatment at hospital, Ms Bailey was allowed to return home for the weekend and appeared to improve. However, three days before her death, her condition worsened when she began receiving text messages from a work colleague, the inquest heard. Mr Connor added: 'There had been a lot of interaction that day with work colleagues who had been texting her. She struggled to reply to these texts. 'She had had several texts regarding work issues from a history teacher who was quite a close friend of hers. She was aware that Caroline had been pretty bad but not aware she was on a ward. 'They were lengthy messages and she struggled to reply to the messages and read through to make sure what she was writing made sense. 'She was fixated on work.

{"abstract": "Humans may have first inhabited rainforests around 20,000 years ago, according to researchers at Oxford University. The team found evidence of this in human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka. The study also suggests that humans may have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago, contradicting the idea that such environments were largely human-free until around 8,000 years ago.", "article": "They are some of the richest habitats on the planet yet also the hardest for humans to inhabit. Now scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought. Researchers at Oxford University found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka. Scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought. Researchers at Oxford University found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka (pictured) They say isotopes in the teeth suggest the people they belonged to had a diet mainly composed of food foraged from the forest. The study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago. Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. The findings add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as. The findings contradict the idea that tropical rainforests were largely human-free environments until around 8,000 years ago. Professor Julia Lee-Thorp, an archaeologist at Oxford University who helped lead the study, said: 'The isotopic methodology applied in our study has already been successfully used to study how primates, including African great apes, adapt to their forest environment. 'However, this is the first time scientists have investigated ancient human fossils in a tropical forest context to see how our earliest ancestors survived in such a habitat.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Science, studied the fossilised teeth of 26 humans of a range of dates - from 20,000 to 3,000 years ago - found around Sri Lanka. The areas where they were excavated from are all now dense rainforest but it was not clear what the landscape was like when the people were alive. By examining the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the teeth, the researchers were able to see that the humans had a diet that matched those of people living in slightly open 'intermediate rainforest' environments. The study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago. Rainforests, like in Sri Lankan above, may teem with life but beneath the trees life can be hard for humans.\u00a0The findings contradict the idea that such rainforests were largely human-free until 8,000 years ago. The teeth were found in rainforests  in southern Sri Lanka including in the Batadombealena cave (marked) Patrick Roberts, an archaeology student at Oxford University and lead author of the study, said: 'This is the first study to directly test how much early human forest foragers depended on the rainforest for their diet. 'The results are significant in showing that early humans in Sri Lanka were able to live almost entirely on food found in the rainforest without the need to move into other environments. 'Our earliest human ancestors were clearly able to successfully adapt to different extreme environments.' Professor Mike Petraglia, who also took part in the study at Oxford University, added: 'Our research provides a clear timeline showing the deep level of interaction that early humans had with the rainforest in South Asia. 'We need further research to see if this pattern was also followed in other similar environments in Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Australasia and Africa.' This tooth, also found at the\u00a0Batadombealena cave in Sri Lanka may be even older than the ones in the study.

Tragic couple:\u00a0Donald Rowland (left), 88, has pleaded guilty to first-degree involuntary manslaughter in the October 2014 stabbing death of his wife of 64 years, Betty Rowland (right) Police say Rowland told officers he killed his wife and tried to take his own life, because he didn't want them to be a burden on their family. A neighbor told the Columbia Daily Tribune that Betty Rowland had recently had a stroke. Appearing in court Monday in a striped jail garb and accompanied by his attorney, Rowland only answered 'yes' and 'no' in response to Judge Kevin Crane's questions. Prosecutor Merilee Crockett recommended seven years in prison for the octogenarian defendant.

Coefficients are based on European performances over the last five seasons which is why Manchester United are placed higher than City despite not qualifying last season. Arsenal's ranking also remains high because they have reached the Champions League knockout stages every year in the time span. City have complained in the past of unfavourable draws in the Champions League group stages hampering their progress. Despite more than \u00a31billion invested into the club since 2008, the Abu Dhabi owners have not seen their side progress beyond the first knockout stage of the competition. They failed to qualify from a tough group in 2011-12 after being paired with Napoli, Bayern Munich and Villarreal and suffered the same fate the following season against Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax. Their co-efficient has risen since and they were able to finish second in their group this season after being placed among the second seeds and being drawn against Bayern Munich, CSKA Moscow and Roma. However, UEFA have changed their seeding policy for next season and the domestic champions of England, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Russia will automatically be top seeds alongside the winners of this year's competition. Man United will be placed in pot two if they finish inside the top four despite last season's poor campaign. Chelsea are ranked the fourth best side in Europe - behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The second pot will be made up of the next eight highest-ranked clubs \u2013 and City can't be certain of that. Among the clubs just below them in the listings are Juventus who look certain to be top seeds as Italian champions and Sevilla, Inter Milan and Napoli who are all still in the Europa League and can improve their coefficient in that competition. There are still a lot of twists and turns in the domestic leagues before next season's seedings are announced and of course City still have to confirm their own participation by finishing in the top four of the Premier League. But there is no doubt the outcome in the Nou Camp, where they have to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit, could have an effect on City.

'I was in a movie theater with my boyfriend, and some students walk in and start shooting pictures of me in a movie theater,' she told KCAL9. After discussing the situation with the school district, it was decided that Swager should adopt her new identity immediately. Swager considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to\u00a0notify only students in her class and their parents, rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone. 'We decided as a district, as a faculty, that it would do more harm than good to do a mass notification,' Swager told NBC4. 'Instead do individual notifications in classrooms where they knew what to expect.' The district's handling of the matter and Swager sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it. The Chino Valley Unified School District have updated information of their website about Swager after the decision was taken that she would transition to a woman sooner than originally planned. 'On a Friday he was a man, on Monday he was woman,' said one parent. 'This probably brought or is going to bring disruption in the classroom because all these questions need to be answered,' said another, who identified himself as Rusty. 'They're going to want to know why did the teacher did what he did.' Students interviewed seem less concerned. 'If it's what she wants to do, I mean, I'm not going to judge. It's what she wants to make her happy,' said a pupil called Madison. A spokesperson for the Chino Valley Unified School District said they can't comment because it's a personal and private matter for the teacher. Swager has asked parents to not be angry with the school district. 'I've got nothing but overwhelming support from the school district,' she said. The teacher also told NBC4 that she has no regrets and now wants to focus on doing her best job in the classroom. 'It's just relaxing to be able to wake up in the morning and just be me,' she said.

The ex-husband, Garrett Cunningham, is currently being tried on two counts of sexual battery, one count of false imprisonment and one count of battery.", "article": "Taking her place on the witness stand, a Florida court bailiff described being sexually assaulted at gunpoint the day she asked her husband for a divorce after his gambling had led them into debt. The 55-year-old woman tried to hold back tears as she spoke Tuesday of being held against her will by her ex-husband, Garrett Cunningham, 64, also a Broward court deputy, though he is currently suspended. The Sun Sentinel reports that the couple met in 1983 while working as corrections officers in New York City's Riker's Island. Alleged assault: Garrett Cunningham, 64, who worked as a court bailiff was accused by his ex-wife of handcuffing and shackling her before sexually assaulting her in 2013. They married in 1990, but the woman described how Cunningham's gambling habits drove them into debt, costing them their house and his car. The woman said she tried to keep the couple afloat - even covering a $2,000 debt Cunningham owed - and stated that even after they separated, she would drive him to work. In September 2013, she drove him to the Plantation motel on State Road 7 where he had been living and asked her to help carry groceries to his room, she said. She testified that once inside the room, Cunningham handcuffed her and shackled her legs, before pulling out a Glock pistol from under the mattress and pointing it at her. On the wall was a note listing everything Cunningham had done wrong in his life, while a second note on the bed had a list of questions about her personal and dating life, according to an arrest affidavit. What followed was an hours-long interrogation, where Cunningham berated his wife over who she was dating, she testified. County court: Cunningham and his ex-wife met as corrections officers at Riker's Island in New York City and began working as bailiffs in 1999. Cunningham demanded her phone and the password to unlock it. After reading texts sent between her and a man she had met online, he threw the phone to the floor and shot its screen, she said. 'He had this crazed look in his eye,' she claimed on the stand. 'I just knew in that moment that I was not coming out of that hotel room alive.' She said that after several hours Cunningham concluded she had to be punished, and used a vegetable to sodomize her. When she cried out, he pointed the gun at her head and told her that he would shoot her if she couldn't stop screaming, she said. She testified that she cried as she held back screams as he continued his alleged assault. Cunningham was arrested days later. In December, he was suspended without pay by the Broward Sheriff's Office. He is currently being tried on two counts of sexual battery, one count of false and one count of. His wife left the motel after allegedly being attacked, then showered and fell asleep, according to Cunningham's attorney, who seized on her delay in reporting the assault. Defense attorney Gabriel Ermine said the woman fabricated the story of assault in hopes of keeping an inheritance she had recently received from her late parents. 'She wanted it all to herself,' Ermine said in an opening statement. 'Now she's using you to convict him so he doesn't get any money.' The woman called police after the assault and attempted to get Cunningham committed under Florida's Baker Act, which allows for the involuntary examination of a person that poses threat of harm to self or others. She reported the alleged assault two days later,  explaining to the jury that she had a difficult time coming to terms with what had happened at the hands of her husband.

I cared for you.'", "candidates": [["A Florida court bailiff has testified that her ex-husband, Garrett Cunningham, sexually assaulted her at gunpoint the day she asked her husband for a divorce after his gambling had led them into debt.

'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it,' the profile later said after removing the post. Athena's Tennis Girl poster caused a Twitter stir and Wimbledon was forced to apologise after using it to promote a forthcoming exhibition called Powerful Posters. Last year the dress worn by Butler in the famous image, the wooden tennis racquet she is holding, a a 1979 edition poster and a 1980s limited edition canvas print were sold at auction for \u00a315,500. While such a price may indicate its historic value and iconic status, many on Twitter felt it had no place as a promotional tool for the exhibit in which it features at the respected venue. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma expressed her outrage on Twitter, saying: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who go by the name 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster, which will be exhibited with the handmade dress worn by model Fiona Butler and wooden racquet used in the 1976 shoot, to promote the exhibition. Even the wording of the apology attracted criticism as a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Twitter user David B backed the club, saying: 'Presumably John McEnroe will now have to be airbrushed out of Wimbledon history? These PC idiots - \"They cannot be serious!\"' An All England Club spokesman has since confirmed the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over two million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Roger Federer's fan group said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for \u2013 I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.'

Speaking of the project, Downer said: 'Unlike Penguin-cams, this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast-moving dolphins, often out in the deep ocean.

The study by researchers at the University of East Anglia estimates that 382million people had diabetes in 2013. At current rates, that figure is expected to reach 592million by 2035.

In China and India, almost 10 per cent of adults have diabetes, compared with the global average of 8.3 per cent, reveals the study published in the journal Pharmaco Economics. In Britain, around 3.2million people have diabetes. Lead researcher Till Seuring said: \u2018Diabetes has become an epidemic. \u2018The rising prevalence of diabetes in these countries has been fuelled by rapid urbanization, changing eating habits, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. \u2018Diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to grow to 592 million by 2035. \u2018It is a chronic disease that has spread widely in recent decades - not only in high-income countries, but also in many populous low and middle-income countries such as India and China.\u2019 He added: \u2018We would hope that the findings further increase the policy attention being paid to diabetes prevention and management in rich countries and it should in particular make health and economic policymakers in developing countries aware of the economic damage that diabetes can do.\u2019 The study, published in the journal Pharmaco Economics, cited data from the International Diabetes Federation estimating that 8.3 per cent of adults aged 20 to 79 now suffer from diabetes.

They found that increased healthcare costs and reduced workforce productivity could severely dent economic growth. A woman adjust a device which delivers insulin to her body. In Britain 3.2 million people suffer from diabetes. And Mr Seuring warned of a hidden cost of carers, many of whom leave their jobs to care for loved ones. In Britain, where 3.2million people suffer with diabetes, Mr Seuring estimated the cost to be significant. He said: \u2018People in the UK with diabetes experience an income loss of \u00a3887 per year. But it is carers in the UK who are the worst hit financially, with a reduction in income of \u00a31327 annually.\u2019 That pales in comparison, however, with the US where the annual diabetes healthcare cost is $6,800 (\u00a34,600) \u2013 and the total economic burden per person reaches $283,000 (\u00a3191,200) over a lifetime.", "candidates": [["A study by the University of East Anglia has found that diabetes has become a global epidemic, affecting one in 12 adults and is set to soar by 55% in the next two decades.

Ms Meagher's father, George McKeon, said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was evident from the findings in the report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. Mr McKeon has spoken out following his daughter's killer, who has been described as deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, being convicted of three more rapes - two sex workers and a Dutch backpacker - bringing his number of victims to 12.

Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women as an expert claims the notorious predator gained pleasure from inflicting pain. The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation. Ms Meagher's father George McKeon (right) with\u00a0on Jill's wedding day with her cousin Louise McKeon (left) said\u00a0the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. Ms Meagher's murder triggered a parole system review by retired High Court judge Ian Callinan, who released his findings in July 2013. Bayley was released from prison on parole in 2010, but that should have been cancelled after he was convicted of assaulting a man in February 2012. Instead he appealed the assault charge and was released on bail, leaving him free to rape the 25-year-old, the backpacker and kill Ms Meagher. Ms Meagher's father George McKeon said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was clear from the Callinan report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. 'As a family, we have until now been very mindful not to make any statement or take any actions that might delay the outstanding criminal proceedings against Gillian's murderer,' McKeon said in a statement. 'However now that these proceedings are completed, we want to try and obtain closure and to ensure that other families don't have to endure this trauma.' 'In particular as a family we would like to:. 'A - Continue to raise awareness of the systemic problem of violence against women, an issue we as a family and Tom Meagher, in particular, is very closely associated with in both his writings and his role as an ambassador for the White Ribbon Campaign. 'B - Ensure that the proposed Coronial Inquest into the circumstances of Gillian's death does not proceed. Following the Callinan Report, the 20 May 2013 amendments to The Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) and the criminal proceeding in relation to her murder, we see little to be learned or gained from an open Inquest into her death.' The coroner removing Ms Meagher's body found on Black Hill Road in Gisborne South, north of Melbourne, Ausatralia, September 28 2012. To add to his string of offences, Bayley has been convicted of\u00a0raping an 18-year-old sex worker in his car in St Kilda in 2000 and a 25-year-old sex worker in April 2012 in eerily near identical circumstances. The 43-year-old also raped a Dutch backpacker in July 2012, just two months before his fatal attack on Ms Meagher, after telling her she was in danger and convincing her to climb into his car for safety. Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape. He contested each charge but juries found him guilty in three separate Victorian County Court trials. Suppression orders prohibited media outlets from publishing any details from the rape cases until the third guilty verdict was handed down on Thursday. His defence team argued that the three sexual assault victims had mistaken their attackers for Bayley because he featured heavily in the media spotlight with Ms Meagher's case. Bayley has now been found guilty of raping 10 women and attempting to rape two more. He is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Bayley was found guilty of raping the 18-year-old in July 2014, but suppression orders prevented reporting of the case until he faced the two other trials this month. Judge Sue Pullen lifted the orders when the final jury returned its verdict on the backpacker's case on Wednesday and will sentence Bayley at a later date.", "candidates": [["Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women, bringing his number of victims to 12.

Marks stole the money over a seven-month period by taking the victim's bank card and using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. The victim was so upset by the crime that she had to leave her home and move into sheltered accommodation.", "article": "Jailed: Vicky Marks stole \u00a34,200 from vulnerable Joan Groucher while pretending to care for her. A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary. Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder \u00a34,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period. The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard. Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.' He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money. 'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.' Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care. 'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did. 'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.' Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks \u00a310 every time she visited. The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year. Hearing: Croydon Crown Court (above) heard Marks even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital. 'She noticed there was \u00a32,000, or \u00a33,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said. Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of \u00a3100 and \u00a3200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added. She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing \u00a3100 from the victim's account the previous day. Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing. Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail sentence, but added: 'It's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly. 'Part of that is due to her age, but every time I see her she mentions it and says, \"Why did she take it?\" and \"How could she do that?\" 'When I told her about the sentence it was the first time I have seen her smile for a long time.' Mrs Baldwin said she was 'disgusted' by Marks, whom her family had known for around five years, saying: 'If she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow.

Miracle said there was no doubt the Ben Canaan family would struggle like she did to integrate into society. 'Making a decision to come on the outside you leave with basically the clothes on your back,' she said. 'I think the biggest struggle is at our age - I was 45 - and to start life from scratch, normally you would have built up a life from a young age. 'The struggle is just so hard. 'You don\u2019t know any obligations to renting a home, opening bank accounts. You don\u2019t even have a birth certificate or driver\u2019s licence \u2013 or any identity to even be able to do those things.' The Ben Canaan family, who are among a number of large families to walk out on Gloriavale in recent years, are now staying 300km away in Timaru. Miracle,\u00a0daughter of Gloriavale's leader, Neville Cooper, has spoken for the first time since leaving the remote community five years ago about her struggles to reintegrate in the 'outside world' The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing\u00a0- despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. James and Hope Ben Canaan have since forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while their children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. 'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the\u00a0New Zealand Herald\u00a0on Wednesday. The father, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job. Ms Gregory said the family had 'come to believe they were in a false system and left 500 of their family and friends (the only ones they've every known).' 'They are hugely courageous\u2026they are very excited about starting life out here,' she said. 'They are feeling blessed, but are aware of the road ahead of them.' Ms Gregory told the Herald that the family, who do not want to make any public comment, was in great spirits 'which is incredible, because what they have done (walking out) is massive.' Gloriavale, which was established about 45 years ago, does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members, is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian'. But it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail.

The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. One young couple were married after just six weeks of courtship. Their website states the couple'make vows to God and each other before the Church, for no preacher can'marry' them'.

{"abstract": "The Ig Nobel Prize, a satirical cousin to the Nobel Prize, is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The prize seeks to highlight research that first makes you laugh, then makes you think. Past recipients include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and a study of homosexual necrophilia among mallard ducks.", "article": "(CNN)At first Raymond Goldstein thought he'd received a spam email. The message to the Cambridge University physicist was asking for help working out the dynamics of hair, specifically the shape of ponytails. Goldstein thought he'd \"won the Nigerian lottery.\" Poised to click delete, he scrolled through the message one more time and discovered it was from global consumer goods giant Unilever. Curiosity piqued, he met with a company representative, and the rest, as they say, is history. Assembling a team of balding physicists, Goldstein set out to tackle the subject, publishing their research in a peer review journal. It detailed the fluid mechanics of hair, drawing on a rich seam of scientific observation stretching back to Da Vinci. They even coined a new term: hairodynamics. Attention from the scientific community soon followed, and within a year they were collecting a Nobel Prize. An Ig Nobel Prize, that is. A satirical cousin to the more esteemed Swedish award, the Ig Nobel seeks to highlight research that first makes you laugh, then makes you think. This year marks their 25th anniversary, so what better time to celebrate the Ig Nobels' contribution to the research community? Every year thousands vie for the awards -- \"always sourced from the cheapest materials\" according to founder Marc Abrahams -- held at Harvard University. The ceremony is bathos at its finest. Winners receive their awards from genuine Nobel laureates, but speeches are curtailed by a screaming girl declaring her boredom. Each year a cast of professional singers and scientists perform a mini-opera. Last year's was set to Mozart and featured a chorus of microbial bacteria. Past recipients include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and a study of homosexual necrophilia among mallard ducks (commended by Abrahams for \"its high literary quality\"). However, not all winners can have such high scientific kudos. The Ig Nobels skewered the U.S. Government in 2012, awarding them the Prize for Literature \"for issuing a report about reports about reports that recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports about reports.\" You can read it here. In 2009 the Math Prize went to Gideon Gono, then head of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, for printing a Z$100 trillion note (while also printing 1c). Last year the Italian National Institute of Statistics landed the Economics Prize for bringing the country out of recession through the use of prostitutes, drugs and smuggling. (The Italian government ended up setting a precedent in Europe, with the UK soon including the so-called \"black economy\" in its figures -- national GDP jumped by 5% that quarter, equivalent to $15 billion.) As proved by the Ig Nobels, the line between ridiculous and serious research has always been blurred. This is no better reflected than in Dutch-British physicist Andre Geim. In 2000 Geim scooped the Ig Nobel for Biology for using magnets to levitate frogs. Ten years later he went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\" It is hard to say which is the greater achievement. Abrahams is currently touring the UK touting the Igs, supported by previous winners such as Goldstein and potential candidates like David Dunstan, who found fame by conducting a two year study into the homing properties of garden snails (his modus operandi: throwing them over the garden fence). Soon Abrahams will have to settle down and sift through what he predicts will be about 9,000 entries, before the anniversary ceremony on September 17. Despite his longstanding and much admired pastiche of the Nobels, he is still yet to be invited to Stockholm for the awards proper. Asked if he would attend if offered the opportunity, Abrahams demurs, saying \"he wouldn't want to be a distraction.\" And as for what the Nobel Prize could learn from his own mischievous creation? \"Absolutely nothing.\" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate:.

The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina. The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called \u2018biohackers\u2019 in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that \u2018the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.\u2019 As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye\u2019s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of \"night vision eye drops\" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called \u2018biohackers\u2019 in California called Science for the Masses. It is not advisable to try this at home. They used a solution containing Chlorin e6 (Ce6), found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also used in cancer treatment research. In the team's experiment, the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of Gabriel Licina, one of the researchers, which carried the solution to his retinas. \u2018Ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50\u03bcl [microlitres] into each eye,\u2019 the researchers wrote. The solution  initially made his eyes turn black, before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour. 'To me, it was a quick, greenish-black blur across my vision, and then it dissolved into my eyes,' Mr Licina told Mic. However, to \u2018reduce the potential for bright light exposure,\u2019 the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses. Within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low-light conditions. To test the effects, Mr Licina and four \u2018control\u2019 subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a \u2018darkened area\u2019. Within an hour, Mr Licina was able to see in darkness - for several hours. In experiments he could see three times better than 'normal' eyes.

On a night when John Greig, Walter Smith and John Brown returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team couldn\u2019t match the renewed sense of optimism around Ibrox. Dropping another two points not only means Hearts can win the Championship title before the month is out, it also keeps Rangers in third place behind Hibs - with last night\u2019s visitors only six points adrift. Kenny McDowall issues instructions to his layers during the 1-1 draw with Queen of the South. McDowall says his side must be wary of Queen of the South in fourth and Falkirk in fifth. Asked if he thought that either the Dumfries side or Falkirk could pip his team to the final play-off spot, McDowall said: \u2018There is every chance. They are playing for the play-offs as much as we are. So we can\u2019t be disrespectful of them. \u2018Queen of the South are a good side, as are Falkirk. They are looking to win games like we\u2019re looking to win games. We\u2019ve got to work harder to turn it about. \u2018I think it\u2019s going to go right to the wire, the play-off places, without a shadow of a doubt. We have to find a formula to get winning again, We are stuttering along. \u2018We\u2019re not doing enough in front of goal and obviously not doing well enough to defend our goal. It\u2019s nothing other than hard work until we get back to winning games.\u2019 McDowall, who has won only three of his 10 games in charge since stepping in for Ally McCoist, said he hadn\u2019t yet been told if the new board had accepted the resignation he handed to the previous regime. Rangers midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, celebrates putting the home side ahead at Ibrox. Young Queen of the South striker Aidan Smith (centre) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller. \u2018No - I would expect them to come to me, as opposed me going to them,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve got games to concentrate on with the team, I\u2019m here to do that. I\u2019m sure if the board want to keep me they\u2019ll come and speak to me.\u2019 A cool Haris Vuckic finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give Rangers an ill-deserved three points from a bitty performance. But Queens equalised three minutes from time, 17-year-old sub Aidan Smith on the spot \u2013 and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a Michael Paton shot following a defensive mistake by home sub Bilel Moshni. The home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest Ibrox crowd of the season. McDowall said: \u2018It\u2019s very disappointing, when supporters had come out, the new board is in place and the stadium is full. You get the lead and you are hoping to see it out \u2013 and don\u2019t do it through poor, poor defending.\u2019 Rangers legend John Greig was in the stands at Ibrox for Tuesday night's Scottish Championship clash. Vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute Bilel Mohsni (left), Nicky Clark and Darren McGregor. Queens moved a point clear in the fourth and final play-off spot, although boss James Fowler believed his team could have won, declaring: \u2018It would have been a travesty had we not got anything out of it. We were the better team and had the better chances. \u2018But the boys reacted well after going behind and we are delighted young Aidan got the goal. \u2018Rangers came out fast but we then controlled the game and some of our passing was excellent. We are happy with the point but, being greedy, I\u2019d have liked the three. It\u2019s still going to be difficult to make the play-offs. There are a few clubs in there but we will keep going.\u2019 Goalscorer Smith, making just his second appearance for the club, said: \u2018It\u2019s the best feeling ever. The ball just fell at my feet and I managed to lift it over the keeper. I actually thought Michael Paton was going to score before I did. My dad was in the crowd tonight but I haven\u2019t yet had a chance to speak to him.

The bequests in these bizarre wills also include one from a father who wanted his step-daughter to receive the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother did not pay her for them. The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - based in Farringdon, central London - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills. Unusual: The strange wills include the 1888 document by boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. 'Rotten old pig: Mr Orton, who only left one farthing to his wife, was born in 1818 and died in 1888, aged 70. Bequest: Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, wrote in his will to leave all remaining possessions to his daughter if she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband' or allow him to benefit from the inheritance. Writing's on the will: Isaac Cooke from Surrey, who died in 1936, left everything to his wife, Alice. He wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem. One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose' During that time the experts have dug up scores of unusual passages written on the legal declarations - before whittling these down to a top ten, which have now been revealed. Their discoveries include the 1888 will of boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. They also found a 'beautifully written' seven-versed poem and a will revealing how a man left money to Christ, as long as He could prove His identity. In another will, 59-year-old Annie Langabeer wanted to give her brother-in-law two shillings and sixpence so he could 'buy a rope' because she wanted him to hang himself. Employees at the firm have looked through a staggering 200,000 wills since the late 1960s trying to trace people's family trees. They found one written in 2002 by Stephen Cuthbert, from Wiltshire, which included strict instructions that his estate paid for the 'p*** up' after his funeral. Money: The will of Kenneth Gibson, born in 1923 in Lincolnshire, who requested in 1999 that his step-daughter should get the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages that she claimed in my presence that her late mother Ann Cox had not paid her for' Wide-ranging: Sir Charles Stewart Henry Vane Tempest Stewart, the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, wrote his 55-page will in 1945. He was one of the richest men in the country at the time and had everything covered. He not only wanted his wife to have all of his animals, but also 'the natural increase of animals' too. Romantic: Richard Walker wrote his will in 1981 and decided to leave the majority of his wealth, \u00a310,000, to the 'love of his life', Miss Miss Gay Varasporn Suwanahong - who he met in a bar in Thailand. She could only receive the sum when she turned 21. Mr Walker, from Wolverhampton, died in Bangkok in 1982, aged 41. Staff at Fraser and Fraser also stumbled across the will of Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, who decided what to do with his \u00a32,989 in December 1937. He asked to leave all of his remaining possessions to his daughter as long as she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband'. Mr Smith, who died in November 1942, said the money should go to the Exchequer if she disobeyed his request. Information from another will written in February 1999 found Kenneth Gibson, from Lincolnshire, included a peculiar request. He said his stepdaughter must be given the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother, Ann Cox, did not pay her for them. He died two months later in April, aged 75. The father's odd request was discovered by Neil Fraser, 39, a partner at Fraser and Fraser, while he was working on a case and trying to trace a family tree. Hanging request: The will of Annie Langabeer, from Sutton, Surrey, who died aged 59 in 1932.

In the 53 league and cup meetings since, the likes of Steven Gerrard - likely to start from the bench on Sunday - Jamie Carragher, Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler have starred for Liverpool, while United's local lads have included Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Danny Welbeck. Steven Gerrard looks dejected in defeat after Liverpool were beaten 3-0 by Manchester United last December. Local lad James Wilson also started that game for Manchester United. Manchester-born Danny Welbeck tackled by Gerrard at Anfield last season. Jamie Carragher (left) and Gary Nevill during a game at Old Trafford in March 2010. Wayne Rooney, a designated Scouser, doesn't count (although he was born less than four miles from Anfield), while Ryan Giggs is also excluded as he was born in Wales.

The company said Monday that it's recalling 3 oz. institutional/food service cups of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test detected listeria in one of the cups recovered from a Kansas hospital. There have been no illnesses reported from the cups, Blue Bell said. The contaminated cup was produced at a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in April 2014, the company said. Earlier this month the company recalled a group of products that were made at a plant in Texas as Kansas health officials said three people had died in the past year from a listeria outbreak that could be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products. A total of five people have contracted the serious infection in Kansas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had eaten milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" Listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the CDC. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year; approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth.

The extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. The satellite image produced by NASA records the land surface temperature. The places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue, normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average. The map has been produced using data from NASA's Terra satellite and shows how temperatures this February compared with those over the last ten years.. The satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map  shows a clear divide  right down the middle of the country. The areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue, normal appear white, and those in red were warmer than average. The mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average. Statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in February, but many cities broke their own records, according to Live Science. In New York a new low of minus 13 degrees was set, beating its old record by 1.6 degrees. Last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of New York's Hudson River forcing the US Coastguard to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving. Ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years. A huge ice volcano also appeared in a New York Park. Records were also broken in the likes of Worcester and\u00a0Massachusetts. In contrast record highs were set in the likes of Washington, Nevada, and California during February, according to the website. California is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall. This has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years, according to a study. Experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir - for California to recover.

NASA's Earth Observatory said: 'Most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a\u00a0persistent ridge\u00a0of high pressure\u2014nicknamed\u00a0the \u201cRidiculously Resilient Ridge\u201d\u2014over the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the Arctic into central North America. 'But why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern Pacific during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts. 'A new line of research suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier, thus setting up the unusual pattern over North America. 'Other researchers think there could be a link between Siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes. 'Still others think changes in the Arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western Pacific as the key factor. All participants looking at the question agree: more research is needed.'", "candidates": [["An extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

'I saw him (Conte) shaken this morning,' Italian football federation (FIGC) president Carlo Tavecchio told Radio Rai on Saturday. 'After yesterday's controversy, he received death threats on the internet. Italy boss Antonio Conte is'shaken' after receiving online death threats from Juventus fans. The Italy national team manager has been criticised for pushing his players too hard in training. 'I met with Conte for a long time and he is not calm. All these things have been said on social networks and he feels vilified for something that is not his fault. The FIGC stands by him.' Conte was criticised by John Elkann, the president of the holding company which controls FIAT and Juventus, who said the Italy coach worked the players too hard during the national team's training camps. 'Perhaps he'd like to be remembered as the cherry-picker with the highest number of injuries,' Elkan told Italian media. Former Juventus coach Conte defended his methods. 'I wonder why Elkann didn't ask me that when I was at Juventus? We don't work hard, we work well,' the 45-year-old told a news conference in Sofia ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Italian media reported that Conte was reconsidering his position as Italy coach after the death threats. The Italian FA was not immediately available to comment. Juve midfielder Claudio Marchisio injured ankle ligaments, but will return sooner than first expected. Juventus, however, said Marchisio could be back in action within days. 'After returning from international duty on Friday afternoon, Claudio Marchisio underwent medical examinations conducted by Juventus club doctors and Dr Flavio Quaglia,' the club said in a statement. 'The 29-year-old then underwent an MRI scan on his right knee this evening. The tests ruled positive, excluding the possibility of a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament. Marchisio will now rest, and his condition is to be monitored on a day-to-day basis.' Conte returned Juventus to their former glory before leaving to take charge of the Azzurri. Marchisio underwent his first examination at the Istituto Fanfani in Florence, close to Italy's training ground. 'I spoke to my colleagues in Turin, explained what happened and organised to send the lad straight to the club for further tests,' Italy doctor Enrico Castellaci said. 'Juve gave me the all-clear to make the diagnosis public. That night, I contacted the Juve medics again. Now there are two contrasting test results. Naturally, I'd be very happy if the later test was confirmed. These are the facts.' Castellaci's explanation prompted jokes on social media with Italian media and fans labelling the national team's medical staff as a 'laughing stock'.

Chai Jing, a former CCTV anchor and investigative reporter, quit her job last year to take care of her daughter, who had been born with a tumor, and declared a personal war against smog as a worried mother.", "article": "Beijing (CNN)If you live in China and haven't watched -- or at least heard about -- \"Under the Dome,\" you must have been living under a rock. The almost two-hour documentary on air pollution in China produced by a famous TV journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release Saturday, clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across Chinese cyberspace. The air pollution that's choking Asia. Here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context:. The slickly produced video shows journalist Chai Jing presenting a comprehensive slide show, intercutting with fast-paced footage of her travels across China and the rest of world, to find answers to three questions: What is smog, where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it? As shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of China regularly, the video has struck such a chord with the audience that, in two short days, it's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world's most populous nation. Many Internet users have compared it to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" the Oscar-winning documentary on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. Chai, 39, was already a household name before last weekend thanks to her career at China Central Television, the state-run national broadcaster. As a long-time CCTV anchor and investigative reporter, Chai stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines. Her choice of stories and style of reporting -- calm but tenacious -- have earned her legions of fans nationwide -- with some nicknaming her \"the Goddess\" for her elegance and intelligence on air. Plenty of detractors, however, consider her a leading elitist voice for the country's liberal intellectuals. After writing a best-selling autobiography chronicling her time at CCTV, Chai quit her job last year to take care of her daughter, who had been born with a tumor. Declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother, Chai tries to dig deep in her self-funded documentary. With her former CCTV connections opening doors, she followed and interviewed top environmental and energy officials and experts in China -- and received surprisingly candid responses. While there is no obvious hero in the video, the villain seems to be clear. A former chief engineer of the state-owned oil conglomerate Sinopec brushes off Chai's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible. Tracing the main source of tiny and dangerous pollutants in China to extremely inefficient energy exploration and use, Chai sees the solution in dismantling entrenched interests of the state energy sector -- and also appeals to the public for less reliance on cars and more proactive reporting of polluters. Admiration from celebrity and ordinary viewers -- many said to be moved to tears -- poured in almost immediately. In countless reposts of the video links, people praise Chai for her courage to address the sensitive topic head on and spread the knowledge to the masses. One text message of gratitude to Chai from the new minister of environmental protection -- who had been appointed only a day earlier -- has fueled suspicion among her critics that the video was nothing more than a government PR move. They point to the positive coverage of the video's massive online launch across state media, including an in-depth interview with Chai on the website of People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. Also, the timing: The video was released just days ahead of China's annual parliament session, during which legislators are expected to rubber-stamp the Communist leadership's policy agenda. President Xi Jinping had declared keeping the sky blue in the country as a top priority. Some argue that the energy industry makes a convenient political target, as Xi's ongoing anti-corruption campaign had netted a former senior leader whose power bases included the state oil sector. Others even see the video as propaganda to prepare people for mass layoffs in overbuilt and inefficient state industries as the government restructures the economy. Questions have also arisen on the science in the video -- including Chai's apparent linking smog to her baby daughter's tumor. And the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even China's seasoned censors off guard. Heated arguments have raged online, including blaming pollution on China's political system due to its lack of accountability. By late Sunday night, although the video remained online, all mention of it had been scrubbed from homepages of web portals and news sites. With discussions on the video shifting to social media, a common consensus seems to have emerged: Love it or hate it, Chai's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the U.S. embassy as recently as November.

A teenager who sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knifepoint in a brutal attack which left her with 44 separate injuries has been jailed for 12 years. Sam Rimmer, 19, climbed in through the window of the frail victim's home before launching the 'vicious' sex attack. The drunken intruder was armed with a large bread knife when he broke into her house in Greater Manchester on November 8 last year. The terrified woman became aware of a'shadow in her room' moments before he sexually assaulted and tried to rape her, Manchester Crown Court was told. She fought back and grabbed the knife from the thug, dropping the weapon by the side of the bed. Rimmer, from Irlam, Greater Manchester, responded by punching the\u00a0arthritis sufferer on the shoulder and forcing his fist into her mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying attack. But as she prayed out loud he'suddenly came to his senses', apologised and fled before confessing to a friend. Prosecutor Phil Dobson told the court how the woman's mobility was badly affected by the attack. Because she now struggles to move her right arm, the pensioner has become reliant on her family and struggles to pay for carers to help with cooking, dressing and bathing. Despite sleepless nights, she has shown a'spirited determination and forgiving attitude' in the wake of her terrible ordeal, Mr Dobson said. In a witness impact statement, the elderly woman said she had forgiven Rimmer for the shocking attack. 'I feel comfortable in the home I have had for 55 years and I will not let anyone force me out of my own home,' she said. 'Unfortunately I don't think I will ever be able to forget this incident, due to the physical problems I have and the upset it has caused not only me, but my family. 'I really struggle to understand why he has done this to me, however I have no ill feelings towards him and forgive him for what he has done. 'I'm a strong Catholic and feel sorry for him and his family. I hope he will turn his life around.' Rimmer forced his hand into the frail woman's mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying sex attack, Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard. Hunter Gray, defending, argued that with no previous convictions, Rimmer should not be classed as a 'dangerous' offender. But judge Hilary Manley disagreed, saying that Rimmer attacked the victim with 'extreme force and viciousness'. She added: 'She tried to resist and fight you. You were a young man of 19, making yourself as fit as possible for entry into the Army. She was an 84-year-old who had to use sticks when she walked. 'She is clearly resilient and brave but these offences have had a profound impact on her life... she's not spent a night at home alone since this incident. This was a vicious and humiliating attack on a vulnerable and defenceless elderly woman, it must have been a terrifying experience for her. 'Had she not managed to disarm you it could have ended even more badly.' 'You cannot present a reason why you committed this offence - the lengthy and unnecessary violence causes the gravest concern.' Rimmer admitted attempted rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 12 years. He must spend an extra five years on licence and will not be released until the authorities are satisfied he is no longer dangerous.", "candidates": [["The attacker, Sam Rimmer, 19, has been jailed for 12 years for sexually assaulting an 84-year-old woman at knifepoint in a brutal attack which left her with 44 separate injuries.

Looking back over his career, the playmaker here selects his dream team of leading players to have graced the Champions League. Deco scores for Porto against Monaco in the 2004 Champions League final in Gelsenkirchen. Deco (centre) then lifted the Champions League with Barcelona two years later. The Portuguese star celebrates with Didier Drogba during his time at Chelsea. Goalkeeper. Manuel Neuer. When I was playing in Europe he was not so well known, but he has turned into the best I have ever seen. His performances for both Germany and Bayern are exceptional. Manuel Neuer makes a penalty save from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2012 Champions League semi-final. Defenders. Carles Puyol. Was such a leader for Barcelona. That is not to take anything away from his ability as a defender, but he was as important in the dressing room as he was on the field. Barcelona legend Carles Puyol lifts the European Cup after their win over Man United in the 2009 final. John Terry. Very similar to how Puyol was for Barcelona, John was the leader of Chelsea and is still doing it now. When he does decide to retire, he will be so hard for Chelsea to replace. John Terry lifts the famous trophy after Chelsea's win over Bayern Munich in 2012. Ricardo Carvalho. One of my best moments is winning the Champions League with him, then it was great to play with him again all those years later at Chelsea. Without doubt he is the classiest defender I have ever played with. Ricardo Carvalho carries Pedro Mendes after Porto's triumph in the 2004 Champions League final. Midfield. Diego Simeone. Diego Simeone was a really tough competitor; he would always let you know he was there. He wasn\u2019t just tough though, he had a really excellent range of passing. Diego Simeone guided Atletico Madrid to the Champions League final last season. Paul Scholes. It is not coincidence so many professionals talk so highly of Paul Scholes. Of course he is one of the best midfield players of my Champions League, but also I think you can call him one of the best midfield players in the history of the game. Paul Scholes won the European Cup for the second time when Man United beat Chelsea in 2008. Xavi. At the peak of Barcelona he was at the centre of everything that was good about Barcelona. Maybe the other players got more headlines, but Xavi was the catalyst for it all. Xavi takes on Manchester United's Ryan Giggs during the 2011 final at Wembley. Zinedine Zidane. The one player of my generation I wish I could have played with. Just a fantastic player in every single way. Zinedine Zidane scores his famous volley as Real Madrid beat Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final. Attack. Lionel Messi. Messi is a natural born talent, that is not to say he doesn\u2019t work hard, but you can\u2019t teach what he can do him and Ronaldo are actually I think very different, but at the moment they are the two best in the world. Lionel Messi lifts the trophy for the third time after Barcelona's 2011 win over Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo. What a lot of people don\u2019t see is just how hard Ronaldo has worked to get where he is, he is the ultimate professional. Of course he has natural ability, but not many people know how hard he has worked to be voted the best player in the world. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring for Real Madrid in last season's Champions League final. Ronaldinho. I always remember when we (Barcelona) would go two or three goals up, and Ronny would start to enjoy himself.

It was horribly tense for Monaco once Aaron Ramsey scored Arsenal\u2019s second with 11 minutes to go \u2014 but, once again, in this competition Arsene Wenger\u2019s team lost it in the first leg. That third away goal at the Emirates Stadium was the killer. It was the one Wenger\u2019s players could not match. Monaco knew they had done the hardest yards in London and ultimately settled for heroic defeat. It was like watching one of Nick Faldo\u2019s fourth-day specials. They played to par, laid up at the big one, didn\u2019t take the course on, and won. As Arsenal threw more at it with the minutes slipping away, Monaco pressed forward and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then. Instead, Arsenal were left with hope right until the end, a goal short of the last eight. It is the hope that does for you in the end, of course. It probably would have hurt less to have lost both legs. The goal that brought Arsenal to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in Champions League history came in the 79th minute after Theo Walcott hit a post with a side-footed shot. A rare moment of blind panic saw full back Layvin Kurzawa clear horribly straight to Ramsey. He took a touch and struck it low into the far corner. Cue pandemonium in the closing stages, not least when referee Svein Oddvar Moen, from Norway, signalled a generous period of five minutes additional time. Yet, really, Arsenal did little with it. They lumped it in, Monaco hoofed it out. Predictably, Monaco\u2019s hoofs were better than Arsenal\u2019s lumps. It really isn\u2019t their game. Nor is the high-tempo, high-energy, gung-ho rollercoaster that was Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s famous comeback against Inter Milan in the San Siro, a repeat of which may just have rattled the French side.

There is growing opposition among Islamic clerics to Western trends in gynaecology developments and in particular to mothers who wish to have a pain-free childbirth sometimes referred to as 'too posh to push'. One scholar has recently claimed that the rise in Caesarean operations in the Middle East is part of a plot against Muslim mothers. The wives of ISIS fighters like these will struggle to get pregnant again if they have a Caesarean, according to one cleric who calls the procedure a 'plot against Muslims' Sheikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen has ruled that Muslim mothers shouldn't need any decadent pain-relieving assistance in the delivery of their babies. In his ruling published on an Islamic website he says: 'I would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. 'I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant.' He adds: 'Some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a Caesarean, then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally.' ISIS is trying to build a modern health service, reportedly with help from these nine British medical students who have apparently travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Leaders of the Islamic State have tried to build a modern health service and have appealed to doctors from all over the world to travel to Syria and Iraq to join their medical teams. Earlier this year the Islamic State announced the opening of the Faculty of Medicine in Raqqa, in northern Syria, where doctors are trained in just three years. IS took control of Raqqa more than one year ago, to become one of the group's main strongholds in the region, imposing a so-called 'Islamic curriculum' on educational facilities in the city. Many Western jihadists have based themselves in this part of the region. Last week it was reported that nine British medical students travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Four women and five men entered the country, keeping their plans secret from relatives until shortly before they crossed the border from Turkey.", "candidates": [["ISIS is clamping down on Caesarean operations in the latest attack on what it perceives to be decadent Western practices.

When Louis van Gaal said he needed a 20-goal-a-season striker, I almost laughed. Manchester United have spent huge money and now he is saying Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie or Radamel Falcao can\u2019t score 20 goals? Do me a favour. Rooney issued the perfect response on Saturday. I still don\u2019t know why Van Gaal insists on playing him in midfield. In his career Rooney averages 18.8 goals a season. At United that figure is 20.6 goals. Still not good enough, Louis? Even if he only meant league goals, Rooney still ranks highly. Thierry Henry, one of the deadliest strikers in Premier League history and my Sky colleague at Wembley on Sunday, only scored 20 league goals in a season five times. Wayne has done it twice. His Premier League average is 14.1 a season but Alan Shearer, the league\u2019s leading goalscorer, averaged 18.6. Using Van Gaal\u2019s maths, even Shearer couldn\u2019t get into this United team\u2026. Louis van Gaal's suggestion that he needs a 20-goal-a-season striker is laughable - he has Wayne Rooney. Rooney scores for Manchester United against Sunderland in their 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday. THE BACK FOUR LOVE TO SCORE. It was not a vintage final, but Chelsea\u2019s back four held the key to victory at Wembley. Last time they played Tottenham they conceded five. On Sunday they didn\u2019t give them a sniff. Not only that but they were a threat at every set piece \u2014 Spurs looked fragile whenever John Terry and Co. went up. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify Jose Mourinho\u2019s style: win at all costs. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at Wembley. HAMMERS MUST AVOID FLAT FINISH. It was a surprise to see a Sam Allardyce team concede three set-piece goals. They are normally well organised, but I wonder if Big Sam\u2019s contract situation is affecting the players. It\u2019s the chairmen\u2019s prerogative not to talk deals until the summer, but if the players aren\u2019t sure the manager will be there, they might wonder why they should keep playing for him. Alex Song in particular was poor on Saturday and after a fine season for the club, it would be a pity if it tailed off. Sam Allardyce needs to turn West Ham's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season. Peter Crouch has\u00a0now scored 46\u00a0Premier League\u00a0headers, equalling\u00a0Alan Shearer\u2019s\u00a0record in the\u00a0competition. PETER PERFECT. When I played alongside Peter Crouch at Southampton, I was laughed at for saying he was good enough for England. Crouch has spent his career fighting people\u2019s perceptions, but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities. He scored a fantastic header against Hull but, even at 6ft 7in, heading may not even be the best part of his game. He\u2019s got a great touch, scored some fantastic goals \u2014 scissor kicks against Galatasaray, hat-tricks against Arsenal, volleys against Man City \u2014 and has enjoyed some memorable moments. Peter Crouch celebrates after scoring against Hull City during their Premier League clash. BRENDAN'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION. After that brilliant win over Man City, Liverpool are bang in the race for the top four. And here is a stat to prove it. In his three years in charge, Brendan Rodgers has lost just four league games after January 1. That is some record. Liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time. It helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to Champions League qualification this time round. They were excellent against City, with two world class goals, and they proved there is life after Steven Gerrard. With no Europa League football to distract them now, there\u2019s no doubt Liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch Manchester United and Arsenal. Liverpool's players celebrate during their 2-1 win against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday. MURRAY'S MOMENT. Glenn Murray was key in Crystal Palace\u2019s promotion to the Premier League but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013-14 with injury. He spent the first half of this season on loan but at Upton Park he looked every inch a top-flight striker. His movement was good, he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal, his second was top class.

{"abstract": "The new Formula One season starts with the Melbourne race on Sunday. Lewis Hamilton is expected to win back-to-back titles, with Mercedes set to pick up where they left off last year. Williams and Ferrari are expected to be the closest challengers, while McLaren is likely to struggle due to reliability issues and Fernando Alonso's absence after a mysterious crash in testing.", "article": "The new Formula One season gets underway in the early hours of Sunday morning when Melbourne plays host to the opening race of the campaign. Ahead of the curtain raiser, Phil Duncan assesses the sport's hot topics... So, it looks like Lewis Hamilton is going to waltz to back-to-back titles\u2026. There\u2019s no question that Mercedes are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year. Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter, and they were the quickest, too. Hamilton won 11 of the 19 races last year, and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying, he\u2019ll be tough to beat. Lewis Hamilton appeared in a relaxed mood as he signed autographs for punters ahead of the season opener. Hamilton\u2019s popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter\u2026 Is there any danger he\u2019s taken his eye off the ball? The reigning champion has helped to raise F1\u2019s profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off-season. From the Paris catwalk to the red carpet at the BRITs, Hamilton's never been far from the limelight. His high-profile split from Nicole Scherzinger has hit the headlines, too. But the Briton, now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year, appears to have adopted a new-found maturity in recent times, and his desire to match Ayrton Senna\u2019s feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign. At least, he's telling us that anyway. Hamilton poses in his Mercedes overalls on Thursday as he prepares to defend his world championship. Rosberg, posing for pictures with fans on Thursday, will renew his title battle with team-mate Hamilton. So, what can Rosberg do to stop him? Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 12-7 last term, but his race displays left much to be desired; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014. If the German sorts out his race pace, he\u2019ll give Hamilton a run for his money. At 3-1 with some bookmakers, he\u2019s certainly worth a punt. And what about the rest of the grid? Williams, powered by Mercedes once more, are set to be Hamilton and Rosberg\u2019s nearest challengers. Valtteri Bottas was one of the stand-out performers last term, and his team-mate Felipe Massa is among the most experienced out there. Ferrari, boosted by the arrival of Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull, have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums. Daniel Ricciardo, the only non-Mercedes driver to win a race last year, should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014, but his Renault-powered Red Bull still lacks what it takes to challenge Hamilton and Rosberg on a consistent basis. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas was among the stand-out performers in 2014, and he is set to take the challenge to Mercedes once more. Daniel Ricciardo poses with models at the Albert Park Circuit ahead of his home race in Melbourne. I noticed you haven\u2019t mentioned McLaren\u2026 I thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with Honda? Well, that was the plan, but it looks as though it will be some time before either Fernando Alonso or Jenson Button get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race. The Woking-based outfit, struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace, too. Button, retained by McLaren after a surprise U-turn from the team's hierarchy at the end of last year, has already called for patience, and reckons just getting to the finish on Sunday, should be considered a positive result. Jenson Button is set for his 16th season in Formula One, but McLaren are likely to struggle from the offset. And Alonso, their marque signing, won't be there? No. The Spaniard suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days. CCTV captured the 134mph smash, but the footage \u00a0has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident. The former Ferrari man is confident he will back for the second race in Malaysia, but his participation is yet to be confirmed by McLaren. Kevin Magnussen, dropped by the British team at the end of last year, gets his chance in Melbourne this weekend. Fernando Alonso waves to the media after he is released from hospital following a crash in testing. With a combined age of 68, Alonso and Button form the eldest pairing on the grid, but what about this kid Verstappen? He isn\u2019t old enough to", "candidates": [["The new Formula One season gets underway in Melbourne on Sunday morning, with Lewis Hamilton set to defend his world championship.

{"abstract": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has reintroduced the Blackjack, a supersonic bomber that can outrun the Royal Air Force's fastest fighter jets, and is capable of flying four times further than the fighters that make up Britain's Quick Reaction Alert squadrons. The bomber, which is three times faster than the Bear, has just re-entered service in the Russian air force following a design overhaul. The move comes at a time of heightened tension between Russia and the West, and while Britain's Armed Forces are shrinking due to spending cuts.", "article": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards Britain which can outrun the Royal Air Force\u2019s fastest fighter jets. The introduction of the Blackjack follows sorties by other Russian aircraft near Cornwall last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears. On that occasion, RAF pilots flying Typhoon jets easily caught up with two propeller-driven Bear bombers and directed their crews away from UK airspace. Scroll down for video. The top speed is the same... but our range is less: British Typhoon compared to the Russian Blackjack. The incident led to Russia\u2019s ambassador to Britain being summoned to the Foreign Office to explain the mission. But the Blackjack (Tu-160M) is three times faster than the Bear and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up Britain\u2019s Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) squadrons, according to experts. The bomber, also known as the White Swan because of its shape and huge wingspan, has just re-entered service in the Russian air force following a design overhaul. Experts say it is now more than a match for any UK aircraft, including the Typhoon, which is used to protect British airspace. Like the Blackjack, the Typhoon can reach Mach 2 \u2013 about 1,500mph. Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured)\u00a0has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West, according to experts. But while the Russian aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling, the Typhoon\u2019s limit is 1,800 miles, meaning the Blackjack could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its British counterpart without air-to-air refuelling. Dr Igor Sutyagin, Senior Russian Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said: \u2018The Tu-160M now has greater thrust and fuel efficiency and it can carry a larger payload of conventional missiles. \u2018The test flights were successful and the aircraft is now very potent. There is simply no British aircraft of its calibre or purpose. It is the largest bomber in the world.\u2019 The first two revamped Blackjacks passed a series of test flights last December and have now been passed for service. They are being prepared for possible action at air bases in Russia that are within easy striking distance of Britain. One, Monchegorsk air base near Murmansk, northern Russia, is just 1,000 miles from the British Isles. Ten more Blackjacks will be modernised before 2020. Dr Sutyagin added that the Blackjacks\u2019 revamp was part of a plan by President Putin to boost both Russia\u2019s arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers. It comes at a time of heightened tension between Russia and the West, and while Britain\u2019s Armed Forces are shrinking due to spending cuts. \u2018President Putin has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West,\u2019 said Dr Sutyagin. \u2018He has also improved his long-range nuclear missiles such as the Bulava, which is now very hard to detect on launch. It is lighter and more compact, too, so more warheads can be fitted into a submarine. 'He has also committed to the T-50 low-visibility jet. This stealth jet could lead to potentially massive changes in the distribution of military power around the world. 'He is doubling the number of his Special Forces troops, as well.\u2019 An RAF Typhoon aircraft from Number XI Squadron shadows a Russian Bear-H aircraft (file picture) Between now and 2020, the size of the Spetsnaz (Special Forces) regiments will increase from 15,000 to 32,000. Trained to the same level as Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS), they were used in Chechnya and, most recently, in eastern Ukraine where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by Russian separatists. Experts also believe Putin could send the Spetsnaz to the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, both Nato members, to organise resistance among ethnic Russians. Dr Sutyagin added: \u2018Military activity in Crimea and eastern Ukraine has borne all the hallmarks of the special Russian units \u2013 it would be a mistake to believe the same tactics might not be applied elsewhere.\u2019 The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been following the Blackjack and Russian stealth-jet programmes. But while the Typhoon cannot match the Blackjack\u2019s range, RAF sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air-to-air weapons and its agility. An MoD spokesman said: \u2018The primary role of the Royal Air Force is to defend the UK. We are aware of recent Russian military activity.

And now an amazing 150-year-old photograph has emerged of boys at the private school playing cricket - one of the earliest images ever taken of the sport. The earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match, and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere, has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. An 1860s photograph of young men playing cricket at Eton has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. It is thought to be the second oldest image of the sport ever taken. The photograph was signed by Victor A. Prout in pencil. It will be sold at auction by\u00a0Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester. Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, was a British leader who is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton College when he was a student in the 1780s. The Duke attended Eton, which was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI, before he joined the army in 1787 and later helped defeat Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. According to history, he touched the ground at Eton and claimed: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' His statements were construed by historians as references to the'manly character induced by games and sport' among the English youth. The previously unseen image was taken in the early 1860s and shows 11 young men dressed smartly in trousers and waistcoats. Resting on their bats, they pose for the photographer with the distinctive Eton College visible behind them. The photograph was taken by Victor A. Prout who signed it in pencil afterwards. Dating from around 1862, it was taken just five years after the first ever image depicting the sport. It is to be sold by Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and is expected to fetch at least \u00a3500. Auctioneer and Senior Valuer Chris Albury said: 'This early, and previously unknown, cricket photograph in this album probably dates from circa 1862, some five years after the earliest photograph of a cricket match.' The first ever photo of cricket was taken by Roger Fenton in 1857, a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and famous for his photographs of the Crimean War. He first captured the sport in during a match between the Royal Artillery and the Hunsdonbury Cricket Club at the Honourable Artillery Ground in Islington, London, 25 July 1857. Around 100 years before the image of taken the Duke of Wellington is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton where he was a student. Touching the ground, history claims he said: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' Eton College was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI to school 70 poor boys. The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441. The school has long been associated with cricket with its annual fixture against Harrow dating back to 1805. Cricket has long been part of Eton's sporting curriculum.

The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441. English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt (pictured) perhaps summed up the spirit of the 19th Century best, with his famous work known as 'Vita\u00ef Lampada' In the 19th century, character building through sports was said to be vital in morally equipping young men to achieve greatness later in life. Many held the view that'manly characteristics' were developed by gaming and sports, and that those who flourished on the field would go on to carve successful careers as soldiers or engineers. English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt perhaps summed up the spirit of the age best, with his famous work known as 'Vita\u00ef Lampada'. The poem, written in 1892, refers to how a schoolboy, a future soldier, learns selfless commitment to duty in cricket matches in the famous Close at Clifton College. Vita\u00ef Lampada, which means 'the torch of life', also makes reference to the Battle of Abu Klea in Sudan in January 1885. The poem, in full:.

Legislation forcing Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid is set to become law tonight. Last night Tories lined up to lambast the move, saying it is wrong for aid spending to be protected when savage cuts to defence are expected after the election. A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013/14 defence budget was \u00a334.3billion \u2013 just over this 2 per cent target and down from \u00a335.9billion in 2010/11, when the coalition took over. By contrast, the aid budget has soared from \u00a38.5billion in 2010 to \u00a311.5billion in 2013 \u2013 the year that the 0.7 per cent of gross national income was reached for the first time. When Margaret Thatcher left office, just 0.27 per cent of GNI went on aid. Legislation to set the aid target in stone was passed by the Lords despite opposition from Tory grandees including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, who has described the measure as \u2018gesture politics\u2019. Sir Gerald Howarth, the former Conservative defence minister, said aid spending should be cut to allow an increase in the defence budget \u2013 because Russia is increasing spending on arms and the Middle East is in flames. Foreign aid spending rose to more than \u00a311billion in 2013 as ministers moved to hit the 0.7% target. \u2018This is a dangerous world,\u2019 he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One. \u2018This is not a time to be cutting our defence in any case. If you ask me where you make the savings \u2013 you make them in overseas aid.\u2019 More than 300 Tory backbenchers are expected to rebel on Thursday by forcing a Commons vote on enshrining the 2 per cent defence target in law. Tory MP Peter Bone said: \u2018Most of my constituents would think ensuring the safety of this country is of greater importance than meeting the overseas aid budget. \u2018If the Government is prepared to accept that a percentage of gross national income should go toward a specific priority, it seems crazy that we can do this for overseas aid but not for defence. \u2018We should be putting the 2 per cent Nato target into law.\u2019 The pledge to introduce the law was part of the coalition agreement of 2010 \u2013 but opposition from many Conservative backbenchers meant it never saw the light of day as an official government bill. It had to be piloted through parliament by Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore. It was approved in the Commons earlier this year and yesterday was given an unopposed third reading in the Lords. n SACKED cabinet minister Andrew Lansley suffered fresh humiliation yesterday after being rejected for a top UN role that David Cameron is said to have promised him. The former health secretary, who was demoted two years ago after his NHS reforms ran into trouble, was tipped to become the UN aid chief. But the job has gone to fellow Tory MP Stephen O\u2019Brien, an ex-minister who will replace Valerie Amos as under-secretary for humanitarian affairs.", "candidates": [["A historic vote in the House of Lords commits future governments to spending at least 0.7% of national wealth on overseas development.

But what makes American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, 65, so successful? In an interview with Alistair Campbell for his new book Winners And How They Succeed, she shared the secrets of her success. Anna Wintour shares the traits that have taken her to the top including being decisive and resilient. In a book extract in the Sunday Times' Style magazine, Wintour, who became American Vogue's editor in chief in 1988, reveals that being decisive, delegating and recovering fast from setbacks have taken her to the top - and kept her there. Having been fired from her role as a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar after just nine months in 1975, she said: 'Everyone should be sacked at least once in their career because 'perfection doesn't exist'. She added: 'It's important to have setbacks, because that is the reality of life.' The most powerful woman in fashion and editor of Vogue for almost 30 years is rumoured to have been the model for Miranda Priestly, the terrifying magazine editor who hires Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada. But her analysis of her own strengths is far more human and surprisingly humble than the film character as she asks whether 'journalist' is even the right word to describe what she does. Yet her most surprising trick is pretending to be sure of herself, even if she doesn't feel it. Anna Wintour, second left, sitting next to her daughter Bea Schaffer, earned admiration for wearing her signature dark glasses indoors during the Oscar ceremony. She said: 'It makes it clearer for everyone else. Most people prevaricate. I decide fast.' With the nickname 'Nuclear Wintour' owing to her frosty demeanour Wintour, was made artistic director of Conde Nast by her employer in 2013 and editorial director in July 2014. She attributes being organised and a good delegator to her success, and says there's no need to double and triple check what her staff are doing. 'People work better when they have responsibility,' she said. She also revealed that she has no idea how to make a dress, couldn't create an image from a photo shoot and can't write, and instead responds to other people's talents.

{"abstract": "The mental health checks in the civil aviation industry lack the rigour needed, according to a former BA pilot, Alastair Rosenschein, following the Germanwings disaster. The co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, hid an illness from his employers and crashed the plane into a mountain killing 149 people on board. Lubitz had previously been signed off from training with depression in 2008 and was reportedly receiving mental health support up until Tuesday's crash.", "article": "Mental health checks in the civil aviation industry lack the rigour needed, a former BA pilot has claimed in the wake of this week's Germanwings disaster. Alastair Rosenschein, now an aviation consultant, made the comments after it was revealed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid an illness from his employers and crashed the plane into a mountain killing 149 people on board. 'This recent accident demonstrates that the mental health checks lack the rigour that is specifically required in a safety sensitive industry like civil aviation,' he said. Scroll down for video. Killer in the cockpit: Andreas Lubitz - pictured competing in a half-marathon in 2013 - was reportedly in the middle of a'relationship crisis' when he crashed the Germanwings airliner into the Alps, killing himself and 149 others. German detectives were also pictured carrying computer equipment from Lubitz's family home in the small town north of Frankfurt. Potential breakthrough: German detectives carry evidence boxes from the 28-year-old's apartment on the outskirts of Dusseldorf on Thursday. Yesterday, the boss of Germanwings admitted Lubitz had slipped through the'safety net' and should never have been flying. And today it was discovered the co-pilot hid an illness from his employers. Following a search of his Dusseldorf apartment, investigators revealed they had found torn-up sick leave notes - current ones and one issued for the day of the disaster. Lubitz locked the pilot out of the Airbus A320's cockpit before setting the plane's controls to descend into a rocky valley, French prosecutors said yesterday. He had previously been signed off from training with depression in 2008 and was reportedly receiving mental health support up until Tuesday's crash. The 28-year-old was also in the middle of the'relationship crisis' with his girlfriend in the weeks before the crash and may have been struggling to cope with a break-up,\u00a0German newspaper Bild reported. It was  claimed this morning that the couple may have previously been engaged to be married next year. Mr Rosenschein, who was previously a researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, added: 'The safety net has a very wide mesh and that mesh needs to be narrowed. 'Athough suicide among pilots is not uncommon, murder-suicide is extremely rare.' Slipped through the net: Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had suffered from depression and \u2018burnout\u2019 which had held up his career. Investigators enter Lubitz's house on the outskirts of Dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues. In a blunt admission, Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa, which owns the budget airline, admitted Lubitz had slipped through the safety net. \u2018The pilot had passed all his tests, all his medical exams,\u2019 he said. \u2018He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions. 'We have at Lufthansa, a reporting system where crew can report \u2013 without being punished \u2013 their own problems, or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment. 'All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\u2019 Lubitz passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by Lufthansa, according to\u00a0The Telegraph. The airline said Lubitz trained at the Lufthansa Flight Training School in Bremen. An assessment required by Germany's civil aviation authority, the DLR, plus standards imposed by Lufthansa were needed before he was accepted. However, although the process includes psychometric testing of the candidate's ability to work under pressure and handle stress, they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely, The Telegraph reported. Lufthansa, like other airlines, does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots. Investigation: \u00a0French prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder. Search: Teams working in the difficult Alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings. Debris from the jet, operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline, was found near Barcelonnette. New information about Lubitz's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat, which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend. Officers  found 'evidence of mental illness' but no suicide note, Der Spiegel reported. It is understood detectives have found significant material on Lubitz's computer, which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions. He reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying. However, he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly.

A longtime science teacher in Ohio has been reprimanded for failing to report a student who allegedly took a bottle of illegal liquor he had produced to class. Jennifer Thompson, 52, who has taught at Riverside middle school in De Graff for more than 20 years, reportedly tipped the moonshine down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities. According to Dayton Daily News, she was issued with a formal warning letter as a result, while the pupil in question was suspended from school. Thompson apparently knew the 13-year-old boy and another 14-year-old had created a still and were starting to produce alcohol. While she warned the duo it could be 'dangerous', investigators claim the tutor took no strict action to stop the operation. In January, a report from the Logan County Sheriff says the student brought some of the liquor to show in science class. Thompson disposed of it instead of alerting the principle. Under Ohio law, the illegal manufacture of moonshine is considered a first-degree misdemeanor - carrying the same charges as crimes including petty theft or assault. It is unclear whether the boy who took the moonshine to class will face juvenile delinquency charges in the case.

Uber cars, often black sedans that can be summoned with smartphone apps, now outnumber the yellow taxis that city riders have hailed with a whistle and a wave for generations. It was a changing-of-the-guard moment that passed with little fanfare this week in figures released by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission: 14,088 registered Uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs. Uber cars, which are hailed by an app, now outnumber the yellow taxis in New York City, a place famous for its classic yellow cars (file photo) But it hardly means yellow cabs are out of favor. In fact, there are about 440,000 yellow cab rides a day, compared to just 20,000 to 30,000 Uber rides. That's because Uber drivers often own their own cars and work less than 40 hours a week, while most yellow taxis are owned by cab companies, have more than one driver and are on the road close to 24 hours a day. 'Yellow cab rides significantly outstrip the number of black car rides,' said Meera Joshi, chairwoman of the taxi commission. 'So the number of their affiliated vehicles in and of itself doesn't paint a complete picture.' Uber was introduced in New York City in 2011 and has grown steadily in popularity, particularly among tech-savvy customers who are comfortable hailing rides through an app that shows when a car is on the way. A customer can even follow its progress with a blip on a street map. Similar companies such as Lyft use apps to connect with riders. Prices are comparable, but some Uber riders have complained about fare add-ons for larger vehicles and'surge pricing' during rush hour, bad weather or holidays. Figures released by the New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission shows that 14,088 registered Uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs in the city (file photo) 'I absolutely do love the convenience, and if it's not surge pricing I find the costs very comparable and in some cases cheaper than yellow taxis,' said Kerry Farrell, a paralegal who uses Uber about three times a week. Uber spokesman Matt Wing declined to comment on the significance of the numbers of Uber cars surpassing yellow cabs. But some drivers and their advocates grumbled that Uber's growth has flooded the market, lowering average incomes for all drivers. 'Uber having an unlimited number of cars means no drivers \u2014 taxi or black car and livery \u2014 will earn a decent living,' said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an advocacy group that includes both Uber and yellow cab drivers as members. Mamadou Diallo, who has been driving a yellow cab since 2004, said he once could count on at least 30 fares a day. But his take has dropped 30 to 40 percent since Uber and other such car services entered the New York market. 'It's a jungle,' he said, 'and the big fish always eat the small fish.' New York's 13,587 yellow cabs are in competition with smartphone-driven newcomers on city streets, especially the 14,088 registered Uber cars that now outnumber cabs.

Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal against Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday. NEWCASTLE (4-1-4-1) TIM KRUL 6 \u2013 Dutchman had little chance with either of the Arsenal goals but otherwise looked solid behind a makeshift defence. RYAN TAYLOR 6.5 \u2013 Sound defensively, getting in a good early block on Sanchez, and launched the attack for Newcastle\u2019s goal with a lovely nutmeg. Danny Welbeck and Ryan Taylor do battles as both vie for the ball during the battle at St James' Park. DARYL JANMAAT 6.5 \u2013 Pressed into action as an emergency centre-back in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini, and the full-back coped well on the whole. MIKE WILLIAMSON 5.5 - Can\u2019t claim to have come off best in his duel with Giroud and was too busy trying to wrestle the Frenchman when he headed in the second. JACK COLBACK 5.5 \u2013 First touch let him down on a couple of occasions, not least when he ended up conceding the freekick that led to Arsenal\u2019s first goal. Newcastle United's Spanish striker Ayoze Perez vies for the ball with Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista. VURNON ANITA 5 \u2013 Guilty of playing Colback into trouble on the first goal, and looked vulnerable at times. Replaced by Gutierrez with 20 minutes left. MOUSSA SISSOKO 7 \u2013 Stylish finish to get Newcastle back in the game and went close to an equaliser with a flick header. A real threat. SAMMY AMEOBI 5.5 \u2013 Had his moments but tended to drift in and out of the game. A little better in the second half. YOAN GOUFFRAN 6 \u2013 Another one who struggled to make an impact. Should have done better than poke an effort straight at Ospina from eight yards out in the 60th minute. Yoan Gouffran gets to grips with Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla during the match at St James' Park. REMY CABELLA 7 \u2013 Really came alive in the second half and did well to pick out Sissoko for the Newcastle goal. AYOZE PEREZ 7 \u2013 An isolated figure in the first half but had more support after the interval and went close with a wonderful curling effort. Subs: Gutierrez (Anita 72), Elliot, Obertan, Riviere, Armstrong (for Ameobi 89), Satka, Kemen. Scorer: Sissoko 48. Booked: none. Moussa Sissoko of Newcastle United scores to halve the deficit against Arsenal in the Premier League match. ARSENAL (4-2-3-1) DAVID OSPINA 7 \u2013 Kicked the ball more than he handled it in the first half such was the lack of threat from Newcastle, but called upon to make some important saves after half-time. CALUM CHAMBERS 6 \u2013 Like the rest of Arsenal\u2019s defence, coasted through the first half but ended up hanging on towards the end. Rarely put a foot wrong though. GABRIEL PAULISTA 6 \u2013 One of three changes from the Monaco game in midweek and looked solid enough on his return to the line-up. Laurent Koscielny of Arsenal is tackled by Sissoko of Newcastle United during the Premier League match. LAURENT KOSCIELNY 6.5 \u2013 Dealt comfortably with Perez in the first half but more of a battle after that, and got a punch in the back of the head from Ospina for his troubles. NACHO MONREAL 5.5 \u2013 Strolled through the first half but had his hands full after that as Cabella and Perez stepped up their game. FRANCIS COQUELIN 7 \u2013 Did well snuffing out any trouble in midfield and spilt blood for the cause after a bang in the face, ending the game in a blank shirt. Arsenal's Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez vies for the ball with Newcastle United's  Gouffran.

After her heart suddenly stopped beating, she was rushed to the hospital and put into a medically induced coma. She underwent corrective open-heart surgery and a year of rehabilitation to get her heart used to even the most gentle exercise.", "article": "She had climbed the Great Wall of China, canoed down one of France's longest rivers and danced for more than a decade. And all this time, Karen MacLachlan had no idea she had a lethal, undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time. The self-confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected. The 25-year-old, from Glasgow, had no idea she had the deadly disease - which is usually diagnosed at birth - until her heart suddenly stopped beating. Ticking timebomb: Self-confessed fitness fanatic Karen MacLachlan had no idea she had a lethal, undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time. 'When I collapsed, my mum thought I'd tripped over,' she said. 'It wasn't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance. 'She thought I was dead because my skin had turned a deathly black colour as I lay lifeless on the floor.' Ms MacLachlan was rushed to hospital and put into a medically induced coma. And remarkably, after surgery to rewire her heart, she has made a full recovery. Ms MacLachlan was diagnosed with Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA). This is a rare heart condition where the main ventricle of the heart, which supplies oxygen to the body, is wired incorrectly. Usually, the condition is diagnosed at birth, but there is 90 per cent chance a patient will die from heart failure by the age of one if undetected. Ms MacLachlan said: 'At first, doctors believed my heart stopped as a result of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome not ALCAPA - it's very rare for someone to survive past infancy with it.' 'Doctors were amazed that I'd lived with this condition for so long and never had any problems before.' Indeed, she had always prided herself on being fit and healthy. 'Doctors asked if I'd struggled walking up hills, but I've walked the Great Wall of China - I'm really fit and active,' she said. 'I'd danced for 10 years, canoed one of the longest rivers in France and never had any symptoms, so it was a shock to everyone.' 'Even was taken aback because doctors told me I should have been so unwell, it was really scary. Danger:\u00a0The self-confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected. 'It's terrifying as I now know I could have died at any moment.' Months after her collapse, Ms MacLachlan underwent corective open heart surgery. She then had a year of rehabilitation to get her heart used to even the most gentle exercise. She said: 'After doctors fixed my heart I was really poorly, I didn't realise how much the surgery would affect me. 'I couldn't walk four steps without sweating buckets like I normally do during strenuous exercise. 'I had to learn to build up my energy and became physically fit again. 'Every hour I'd have to walk one length of my parents' hallway to try and build my strength up. 'It hurt to sit down on sofas and I'd struggle to lift myself up because I didn't have enough energy to push myself up. 'Mentally it was pretty draining as well - at first I was scared to leave the house in case my heart stopped again. The 25-year-old said:\u00a0'When I collapsed, my mum thought I'd tripped over. It wasn't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance' 'It took me a year to battle through everything but I've came out the other end independent and stronger again.' She now goes to the gym every day and takes the stairs everywhere she can. And she says she's glad she wasn't diagnosed\u00a0any\u00a0earlier. 'In some ways I'm glad I didn't know I had ALCAPA because I know I would have been wrapped up in cotton wool. If I knew about my condition I had this I don't think I would have gone off to climb mountains or go on adventure holidays. 'It took me a year to battle through everything but I've came out the other end independent and stronger again.' Since recovering, Ms MacLachlan has returned to a normal life but was keen to raise awareness of ALCAPA and other Congenital Heart problems. She has also bared her six-inch scar in a photography exhibition 'Scarred for Life' exhibition to raise awareness for the face behind heart problems.

Scroll down for video. Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless started the hashtag #FacesOfProstitution on social media at the weekend by posting this photo to share positive stories from the industry. The blog post suggested 75 per cent of female sex workers had been raped, 95 per cent were physically abused and 68 per cent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. It also questioned how many sex workers had been deceived by Pretty Woman, the iconic movie that starred Julia Roberts as a warm-hearted prostitute and Richard Gere as a lonely millionaire businessman who fall in love. The post said the movie, which has regained prominence around the 25th anniversary of its release last week, deceived women into leading lives of 'abuse, trauma and slavery'. Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless took to social media at the weekend to hit back at the article and #FacesOfProstitution quickly gained momentum. Carmen Sandiego, a touring escort, was among those to hit back at a blog post that claimed the 1990 film Pretty Woman lured women into the sex industry. Christian Vega, a sex worker from Tasmania, shared support for the hashtag saying he looked nothing like Julia Roberts - referencing the character she played in Pretty Woman. Lucie Bee, who has been in the industry for five years, says she wasn't forced into the industry, but admitted some were. 'Mamamia published an article that says that Julia Roberts' 'toothy smile is not the true face of prostitution' because all sex workers are drug addled victims,' she wrote alongside a photo of herself. 'There is no singular story or person to represent the varied and complex experiences of all sex workers, but here is one face of prostitution amongst a myriad.' Jackie Parker, a sex worker from Griffith in NSW, posted a photo of herself with a volunteer badge on Twitter saying: 'They make me prostitute and volunteer for aged care! This madness has to stop! Save me! She told news.com.au she had worked as an escort for 14 years and hadn't met anyone who was forced into the industry. 'The peple who are doing it tough make up a small percentage \u2014 that is not the norm for sex work in Australia,' she said. 'If you look at the faces of the women on the Twitter hashtag, we're all smiling. Implying we are victims is condescending and makes us feel like we don't have a voice. It makes me feel like I'm not living the right stereotype and it's really harmful.' Jackie Parker, a sex worker from Griffith in NSW, posted a photo of herself with a volunteer badge on Twitter saying: 'They make me prostitute and volunteer for aged care! This madness has to stop! Save me! Jane Green described the message behind the blog post as 'hate speech' as she shared the\u00a0#FacesOfProstitution hashtag.

I worked in an establishment initially, an erotic massage parlour in Canberra, followed by nude modelling, porn and then escorting,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's probably weird for a lot of people to consider that there's a 'journey' that you can take in this industry, much the same as working your way through any industry or career, but I've had one.' 'There's a huge stigma against sex workers in Australia.\u00a0Pop culture generally feeds them the image of the down trodden, broken woman in sex work, which I'm not saying isn't a situation for some, but it's certainly not the situation for all. 'The fact that #FacesOfProstitution is trending makes me so happy. It's this massive symbol of unity amongst the industry, sex workers are feeling like they have a chance to stand up and be represented.'

Above, the hole under which the sunken vehicle was found. Now, Mayer, who lives in Toms River, Ocean County, has been charged with criminal mischief and careless driving, police told\u00a0NJ.com. Animal cruelty charges are also pending against him. Daniel Jolly, 25,  was a passenger in the blue and gray truck on the day of the sinking. He has not been charged because he got out of the vehicle before Mayer drove it onto the ice, officials said. Neither of the pair was injured in the incident. Police and U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene at 12.15am on Sunday following a  report of a truck 'doing donuts' on the frozen river near Gladney Avenue. When they arrived at the river, the witness who had dialed 911 told them they had seen Mayer climbing out of the truck and escaping across the iced-over river before the vehicle went down. As daylight swept in, a Coast Guard helicopter located a hole in the ice. Divers were sent into the freezing water, where they discovered the truck and Rolo's body lying on the backseat, it is said.

Scroll down for video. Alex Chambrello, who has multiple religious tattoos, told police he was Lucifer when he was arrested for setting his home on fire before banging on the doors of an apartment complex and threatening a woman. Minutes later, they received a report of a car that had rolled over about a mile and a half away. As the police chief, who was nearby, headed to the scene, another call came in reporting that a half-naked man was banging on doors of an apartment complex asking to see his wife, WTNH reported.

The police chief, Edward Stephens, said he arrived in time to witness some of the bizarre behavior. 'I pulled into the complex and sure enough there was a gentleman there who we later arrested,' he said. 'His pants were down, his exposed buttocks covered with tattoos, banging on doors.'

The result leaves the Black Cats one point and one place above the drop zone and owner Ellis Short believes a change of manager is needed to avoid relegation. Poyet \u2013 who leaves after 17 months in charge \u2013 was informed of the club\u2019s decision having taken training at the Academy of Light on Monday morning. Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone. Sunderland fans turned on manager Poyet during the defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday. Sportsmail reported earlier in the day that influential sporting director Lee Congerton had advised Short to sack Poyet. A statement on the club's website confirmed the news on Monday afternoon, in which Short said: 'I would like to thank Gus for his endeavours during his time at the club, in particular last season\u2019s \"great escape\" and cup final appearance, which will live long in the memory of every Sunderland fan. Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon looks dejected as Sunderland were thrashed at home by Villa. Gabriel Agbonlahor scored two of Aston Villa's goals in the 4-0 win on Saturday. 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. 'Sadly, we have not made the progress that any of us had hoped for this season and we find ourselves battling, once again, at the wrong end of the table. We have therefore made the difficult decision that a change is needed.' Poyet\u2019s position had become untenable after a breakdown in relationship with Congerton and the club\u2019s fans, thousands of whom streamed for the exits with the team trailing by four at half-time against Villa. A handful of supporters even tried to storm the dugout while some targeted the directors\u2019 box \u2013 including chief executive Margaret Byrne - leaving the club hierarchy in no doubt that a change was necessary. Holland boss Dick Advocaat has already spoken to the club about a short-term deal until the end of the season and he could be installed before Saturday\u2019s trip to West Ham. Congerton is close to Frank Arnesen \u2013 they worked together at Chelsea and Hamburg \u2013 and he is thought to have recommended Advocaat for the role. The new man will inherit a team which has won just once in 12 matches and is without a home goal in more than five hours. Poyet leaves Sunderland after just over a year in charge. Poyet was appointed by Sunderland in October 2013 following the sacking of\u00a0Paolo Di Canio. They were dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Bradford City last month and away fans fought among themselves at Valley Parade. Bizarrely, Poyet blamed the Press for Sunderland\u2019s woes after that game but his excuses did not wash with supporters. Former Rangers and Holland manager Dick Advocaat is one name in the frame to take over. The goodwill generated by last season\u2019s League Cup final appearance and their escape from relegation in the final weeks of the campaign had long since evaporated and few fans will be mourning his departure. Poyet\u2019s backroom team of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway are also expected to leave the club.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (right) receiving Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias (left) at the Foreign Office in Berlin. Kotzias risked further inflaming tensions by referring to the Holocaust to back demands to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras as he arrives at the chancellery in Berlin. He told Suddeutsche Zeitung: \u2018The Allies were very generous with Germany; they did not smother Germany. \u2018There was an interest to build Germany up again. Don\u2019t we have the same rights?\u2019 He went on to ask if the \u2018crimes that our people committed\u2019 were greater than \u2018Dachau or Auschwitz\u2019 \u2013 referring to two of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps where more than a million people were murdered. At the press conference yesterday, Mr Tsipras also renewed the demand for war reparations, saying: \u2018We must work on the issue of forced loans and Second World War reparations.\u2019 However Mrs Merkel said she viewed the demands as an attempt to distract from the need for economic reforms, adding: \u2018The issue of war reparations is closed from a political and legal point of view. The topic has no relationship with the crisis and its emergencies.\u2019 Tsipras is expected to present a list of reforms, hoping to unlock bailout funds to prevent Greece from running out of cash next month, Greek government sources said. The Greek government has insisted that Germany must repay a loan forced on occupied Athens in 1942 and make reparations for Nazi atrocities. European leaders are currently refusing to give Greece any more money unless the Left-wing government commits to reforms. If they fail to come to an arrangement then Greece will be forced to leave the euro \u2013 plunging the continent into financial crisis. Yesterday Mrs Merkel was careful to point out that Germany was only one of the eurozone nations that would be responsible for deciding whether Greece\u2019s reforms are sufficient, and said that no decisions had been made in her talks with Mr Tsipras. But she remained positive, saying the meeting had been held in \u2018a spirit of trust\u2019. The Greek prime minister also characterised the talks as \u2018positive\u2019, saying he found Mrs Merkel \u2018listens and wants to be constructive\u2019. He said the Chancellor had invited him to come to Berlin over the phone, telling him: \u2018It is better to talk with one another than about one another.\u2019 Mr Tsipras went on to say: \u2018I did not come here for financial help. I came for an exchange of our thoughts.\u2019 Yesterday the Eurasia risk consultancy group said the likelihood of Greece having to leave the euro had risen from 20 to 30 per cent. The group\u2019s eurozone analyst Mujtaba Rahman said: \u2018The prospects of a deal are diminishing, as Germany, the eurogroup and Greece continue to posture.

The robbers then tied up and gagged a security guard before entering the nuns' room, where they found the women sleeping, police said.

{"abstract": "German privacy laws prevented doctors from informing Germanwings about Andreas Lubitz's \"suicidal tendencies\" due to strict secrecy laws introduced after WWII to prevent government spying during the Nazi era. Lubitz had received psychotherapy for several years before the Alps disaster, but German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law.", "article": "Andreas Lubitz (above) had received treatment for'suicidal tendencies' but doctors were apparently unable to tell his employer because of strict secrey laws introduced after WWII to prevent\u00a0a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era. Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his'suicidal tendencies' were introduced in response to Nazi rule. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent, it was reported by the Times. With respect to medical data, the criminal code can ultimately leave doctors between a rock and a hard place. For it only allows them breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Still reeling from last Tuesday's disaster that killed 150 people, many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege. A transport policy expert from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), Dirk Fischer, said strict confidentiality policy should be loosened when their patients work in sensitive fields. Professionals such as pilots'should only see doctors designated by their employers,' Fischer told the daily Rheinische Post. He added that such doctors'should be relieved of their pledge of secrecy in communication with the employer and the aviation authority'. Military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the Germanwings plane crash in Seyne-les-Alpes. A military vehicle  carrying a crash site investigation team heads towards the site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash, in Seyne-les-Alpes in the French Alps. Member of parliament Thomas Jarzombek, also of the CDU, called for the creation of a commission of experts to study how to handle illnesses among those whose jobs mean they hold the welfare of many people in their hands. German prosecutors said Monday that Lubitz had been diagnosed'several years ago' with suicidal tendencies and was still in treatment. Although his symptoms had abated, he was apparently written off sick on the day the Airbus crashed. Media reports have indicated that Lubitz, 27, was taking medication for severe depression and was being treated for problems with his vision, possibly for a potentially career-ending detached retina. Investigators evaluating voice recorder data say Lubitz remained silent and breathed calmly as he allegedly locked his captain out of the cockpit and slammed the plane into a French mountainside. Carsten Spohr, the head of parent company Lufthansa, has said the airline was utterly unaware of any health issues that could have compromised Lubitz's fitness to fly, calling him '100-percent airworthy'. His professional performance and behaviour had never attracted cause for concern, Spohr added. The German Medical Board has clear ethical policies on doctor-patient relations: 'Doctors must remain silent about what is told to them in confidence or what they learn in their capacity as doctors.' It applies even after the death of a patient and includes keeping medical facts secret even from family members of the person in treatment, under penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine.

In an attack coordinated via social media, uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before then attempting to subvert the system by voting in 'ugly' people and voting out any good-looking potential members. Scroll down for video. Elitist dating site BeautifulPeople.com is facing a backlash from 'ugly' trolls after removing 3,000 members for letting themselves go. Uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before attempting to subvert the system. Last week it was revealed that BeautifulPeople.com had expelled over 3,000 people for not maintaining the appearance necessary to meet the high standards expected on the site. The move was welcomed by most of the member - but angered outsiders who disagreed with the site's selective policy. The 'Ugly' troll attack originated in Russia where over 2,700 applications were made to the site in a few hours. Over half of these were fake profiles and part of the ugly troll army. Similar coordinated attacks have come from the United States and the United Kingdom with 1,435 U.S. 'trolls' removed from the site and 400 from the UK in the past few days. BeautifulPeople.com is a site that is designed only with Beautifu lPeople in mind where users vote for those they think are the most attractive to stay on the site. 2,700 of the recent surge in fake profiles were from Russia, where the revenge campaign began. Greg Hodge, the managing director of BeautifulPeople.com, said: 'We had large spikes in numbers applying to join the site using profiles which immediately raised the suspicions of our administrators. 'Initially the scale of applications from specific geographical areas \u2013 Russia, the United States and the UK in particular \u2013 caused concern, when we examined the applications in more detail, we noticed a large number of what appeared to be fake profile pictures. 'We then traced this back to various social media sites calling for an attack on our site.' 'People had come together on forums such as Reddit to discuss the site and how they could hijack it by creating the fake profiles.' This is not the first time the site has been under attack. BeautifulPeople.com has been hit with 'denial of service' attacks, and had their rating system sabotaged in 2011. In response the site has introduced new measures to verify profiles and wannabe members must now take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of card with their name and date written on it. Recently 3,000 members were removed because organisers felt they had let themselves go.\u00a0This chap is an example of somebody who would make the BeautifulPeople.com grade. The site introduced a system of validated membership in 2012, whereby entrants are encouraged to take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper with their name and date handwritten on it to prove that their pictures are genuine. Validated members get a'verification stamp' on their profiles. Prior to the attack this feature was optional, but the makers have been forced to make profile verification mandatory. BeautifulPeople.com is the first dating site to force all users to prove they are genuine. Hodge said: 'Fake profiles are the number one problem in the online dating market today. 'We have always led the field in combating this. In taking this next step, we believe we will all but eliminate disingenuous profiles on our site and set the example for the online dating market as a whole. Online daters do not want their time wasted with fraudulent profiles.' The creators of BeautifulPeople.com are husband and wife duo Genevieve and Greg Hodge. He added: 'Having an exclusive dating site is not without controversy. There will always be a degree of jealousy from those who don't make the cut. 'Thankfully, through swift action by our administrators, vigilant members and the introduction of an extra level of verification has meant that we have been able to root out the attackers and ensure that our site remains beautiful and exclusive.' Entry to BeautifulPeople.com is only possible after passing a democratic rating process, where members of the opposite sex vote 'Yes definitely', 'Hmm yes, O.K', 'Hmm no, not really' and 'NO Definitely NOT' based on photographs and a brief profile submitted by new applicants. After the recent cull, over 800,000 members remain on the site, representing 190 countries and almost every ethnic and cultural background. A global average of one in ten applicants that apply to the site are accepted.", "candidates": [["BeautifulPeople.com is facing an ugly backlash after it ejected 3,000 members for letting themselves go.

The soldiers have recently been taking part in the Atlantic Resolve exercise, which was intended to demonstrate NATO's readiness to defend its members. Poland borders Ukraine and Russia and the conflict between the two countries has caused anxiety there. Putin, in particular, is seen as the main driving force behind the war, allegedly sending Russian troops to support the rebels in the east who want independence from the Ukrainian government. In just a year, it has cost more than 5,600 lives - and Russia's neighbours have become increasingly concerned Putin will turn his attention to them next. Lithuania, for example, feels the threat from Moscow feels is so real the government plans to reintroduce military conscription. But so far, America and the rest of Europe have refused to show any sort of military might towards the former Soviet Union - while Putin has made sure the rest of the world is in no doubt of the strength of his armed forces. Just this week, Putin boasted of a massive military exercise across his country, involving 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft, marking the beginning of a series of such drills this year. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin Tuesday that the manoeuvres were aimed at checking the readiness of the newly formed group of forces in the Arctic, as well as the military's capability to quickly field troops to several theatres of operations.

There has been anxiety in Poland recently given the country's proximity to both Russia and Ukraine. The convoy of American vehicles began their trip from Estonia last week and are travelling through Eastern Europe on their way to Germany. Zdzislaw Narel, 60, said it was a historic moment to see the U.S. forces parade through Bialystok. He said: 'This really means a lot to us. We see that we are not alone, that there is someone to defend us.' Meanwhile a U.S. soldier was heard saying from atop of a Stryker that they felt like movie stars. The Dragoon Ride convoy of vehicles began travelling though Europe last week from Estonia. Poland is also beefing up its own defences through exercises with NATO troops and through training its own reservists.

They leave behind wives, fiancees, parents, children and friends. They will be missed. And remembered. Seven of those on the helicopter were Marines based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

The Alexandria resident was known for his outsized personality. \"He was more like a force of nature,\" said Maj. Andre Jeansonne of the 135th Aviation Regiment. \"His huge heart touched the lives of all he met.\" Strother had deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and just last year to Kosovo. He also served during Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Isaac. He commissioned as a warrant officer but went on to become an instructor pilot with more than 2,400 flight hours, including more than 700 combat hours. Strother leaves behind a wife, a son and a stepdaughter. Bergeron enlisted in the Marines in 1998 and joined the National Guard in 2001. He'd deployed to Iraq twice and served during state deployments for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Isaac. Sgt. 1st Class Brian Marquez called Bergeron one of the most qualified crew chiefs in the Guard, with more than 1,300 flight hours, including 377 combat hours. \"He was a subject matter expert in his job,\" Marquez said.

He served during state deployments for Operation Deepwater Horizon and Hurricane Isaac, the Guard's website said. \"Tom was full of life, and his personality could light the room,\" Marquez said. \"He will be greatly missed by the unit and the flight facility.\" Florich is survived by his wife, father and stepmother. He was posthumously promoted from sergeant to staff sergeant. Theresa D. Hipple was thrilled her stepdaughter, Erika, planned to marry Bawol this October. After all, the Warren, Michigan, Marine \"was an all-around wonderful guy -- the kind of guy you would want your daughter to marry,\" Hipple told The Macomb Daily in Michigan. High school chums told the newspaper they jokingly called Bawol \"The Patriot\" because he always seemed to do the proper thing. He was a stand-up guy you could depend on. Friends said Bawol enjoyed hunting trips and was in peak physical shape. Bawol had completed a tour in Afghanistan. \"The pain will linger,\" Hipple said. \"I don't know that you ever get over it.\" Bawol joined the Marines while attending Olivet College to play baseball.

Blaylock, a swimmer in high school, attended Henry Ford Community College before enlisting. He was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and 2008. He was deployed to Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014. Flynn hailed from Reading, England, and moved to Queens, New York, in 2002. He enlisted four years later and was sent to Iraq the next year.

Jeanette Skjelmose, Ikea\u2019s lighting and wireless charging business area manager, said: \u2018Through research and home visits, we know that people hate cable mess. \u2018They worry about not finding the charger and running out of power. Our new innovative solutions, which integrate wireless charging into home furnishings, will make life at home simpler.\u2019 Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally. There are now more than 80 Qi-enabled smartphones available. Among these are models of the Nokia Lumia, Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Sharp Aquos. In the spotlight: Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally. Starting out: One technology industry analyst said it was a'very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology' Menno Treffers, chairman of the Wireless Power Consortium - which developed Qi - said the new collection shows customers 'the beauty and simplicity of wireless charging'. The most common type of wireless charging is known as inductive charging, which works on a well-known but rarely-used principle most often seen in electric toothbrushes. It was discovered by British scientist Michael Faraday in 1831. Mobile phones are using a more advanced version of the technology, which can operate over centimetres, rather than millimetres. The docking station has a coil within the charger, which generates an electrical field around the device. When a suitable mobile phone is placed next to or on top of the station, a coil within the battery resonates with the primary field. It then takes power from the magnetic field and converts and stores it back as electrical energy. He added: \u2018We applaud Ikea for its unmatched insight and their unique passion for making wireless charging affordable and simple for consumers.\u2019 Two months ago Ikea - which employs 147,000 people worldwide - reported annual profits of \u20ac3.3billion (\u00a32.4billion) for 2014, unchanged from the year before. One of the designers of the Home Spot range, David Wahl, said: \u2018We have created smart wireless solutions so you don\u2019t need to see the cables anymore. \u2018Many products can be charged at the same time, but you still have a beautiful wireless home.\u2019 Technology industry analyst Jeff Kagan said it was a \u2018very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology\u2019.

{"abstract": "Ayman Odeh, a charismatic 41-year-old lawyer of Palestinian descent, is leading Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties for the first time to form a slate known as the Joint List. They are poised to take as many as 15 seats, potentially making them the third-largest party in the Knesset after Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his main rival, the Zionist Camp coalition, potentially giving them the balance of power. Odeh's most immediate goal is to deny a new term to Netanyahu, who he says has led the \"most racist government in history.\"", "article": "Jerusalem (CNN)In a sea of Jewish parties campaigning at Hebrew University, Ayman Odeh was the star attraction. But this powerful new face in Israeli politics is not Jewish. While he is an Israeli citizen, the charismatic 41-year-old lawyer is of Palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million Israeli Arabs living in Israel. Under Odeh's leadership, Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the Joint List. Come election day on Tuesday, they are poised to take as many as 15 seats. This could potentially make them the third-largest party in the Knesset after Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his main rival, the Zionist Camp coalition, potentially giving them the balance of power. It is a game-changer, giving a significant voice to one-fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. His most immediate goal is to deny a new term to Netanyahu, who he says has led the \"most racist government in history.\" \"Netanyahu says the danger to Israel is not Palestinians in the West Bank, but rather Arabs in Israel. What is that telling me as a citizen of Haifa?\" he asked in an interview on Saturday. \"With 15 seats in the Knesset, no one will ever be able to ignore us again.\" Until now, Arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences. They run the spectrum from communist to Islamist. But a law passed by the last Knesset, sponsored by the right-wing party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the Knesset. Many believed Lieberman's goal was to push the Arab parties out of the Knesset. It's a theory that was given credence when, in recent televised debate, Lieberman warned Odeh, \"You are here for now.\" \"Why are you even here?\" Leiberman said to Odeh. Baiting him by accusing him of \"representing terror groups,\" Lieberman turned to Odeh and said, \"You're not wanted here.\" Odeh politely noted that his Joint List was polling well ahead of Lieberman's party. \"I'm very wanted in my homeland,\" he said. \"I'm part of the scenery. I resemble it.\" With that calm, dignified response, Odeh attracted political star status among Jews and Arabs alike. At the Hebrew University forum, event students campaigning for the Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Party wanted to take selfies with him. More importantly, he has given hope to the 1.6 million Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality. In the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood of Haifa where Odeh grew up, the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son. Odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician, speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the Joint List gets enough seats to change the face of the Israeli government. Over hummus and stuffed vegetables, he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and its Arab population, speaking about issues such as education, housing, employment for women, public transportation in Arab towns and recognition of unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev. Growing up, he says he identified with Malcolm X. But as he got older, he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. With a large block in parliament, Odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel. \"What makes people vote is the hope of change,\" he said. \"We have been ceding hope again and again. But we are 20% of the population. We can prevent the right from forming a government.\" There is some skepticism here that Arabs will finally have a say in how the government is run, but most are hopeful. Sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street, Sami Abuliat says Odeh is a good spokesman for Palestinians living inside Israel. \"We've asked for so many rights we don't we won't get,\" Abuilat says. \"The big eat the small. But united, we can be strong. This is a good first step.\" If, as many expect, Likud or Labor fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government, they may be forced to join together in a \"national unity\" government. That would make the next biggest group of parties, and Odeh, the official opposition. It's a position he says he would prefer over joining an Israeli government, which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the Palestinians.

The US needs Iran's help in defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and Iranian restraint will be required in preserving Iraq as a single and stable state thereafter. However, a substantive agreement on Iran's nuclear program does not seem imminent, and the US is at pains to insist that no deal is better than a bad deal.", "article": "(CNN)In 1984 Margaret Thatcher met Mikhail Gorbachev (before he became Soviet leader) for the first time. Asked of her impressions, she said: \"We can do business together. We both believe in our own political systems. He firmly believes in his; I firmly believe in mine. We are never going to change one another.\" \"Doing business together\" might sum up the Washington-Tehran relationship today. They have overlapping interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, perhaps even in Yemen -- as well as the shared goal of an agreement on Iran's nuclear program, if not how to reach it. The Obama administration has a keen interest in coaxing Iran back into the \"community of nations\" because it is a regional power, a major player in a volatile part of the world. Were the nuclear talks to leave Iran as a \"threshold state\" -- capable of becoming a nuclear power in short order -- Turkey, Egypt and others in the region also might be tempted also to go nuclear. And Israel might carry out its threat of a military strike on Iranian facilities. But U.S. and Iranian interests converge in more immediate ways. Defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- the most high profile and urgent objective of U.S. foreign policy -- requires Iranian help, and quite a lot of it. Beyond coalition airstrikes, ground forces are comprised of the Iraqi security forces, Shia militias and Iranian advisers and officers. In some areas, the Iranian air force has been active. On Sunday, Iraqi troops and the militias began an offensive to retake Tikrit and the province of Salahuddin from ISIS. Next to Mosul, Tikrit may be ISIS' most important holding in Iraq. On the frontlines, according to the Iranian Fars news agency, was none other than the leader of Iran's Quds Force (or Revolutionary Guard Corps), Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani -- often dubbed Iran's spymaster -- has huge influence in both Baghdad and Damascus. And the Revolutionary Guards have influence over the powerful Shia militia in Iraq known as Hashid Shaabi that is an important component of the fightback against ISIS. The Institute for the Study of War observed that \"the presence of an Iranian general, other Iranian advisers, and Shia militias on the ground alongside Iraqi Sunni fighters to retake a major Sunni provincial capital will be a significant test case for the success of similar future anti-ISIS operations.\" And not only is Iranian help needed in defeating ISIS, but Iranian restraint will be required in preserving Iraq as a single and (dare one hope) stable state thereafter. To many observers, former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki set the stage for ISIS' rise through his increasingly sectarian and anti-Sunni policies. But now the excesses of some Shia militia in Iraq threaten to alienate the Sunni tribes that Maliki's successor, Haidar al-Abadi, is trying to woo. In a veiled reference to alleged abuses by Shia militia of Sunni civilians, Prime Minister Abadi ordered all forces taking part in the Tikrit operation to take \"utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property.\" But he needs Tehran's help in reining in the Hashid Shaabi. A similar environment may yet produce a U.S.-Iranian \"understanding\" in Yemen. The Iranian-backed Houthi militia -- a Shia sect -- is now in power (at least in the capital, Sanaa). The Houthis are, ostensibly, hostile to the United States, and Washington would rather see President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi back in charge. But the Houthis and Yemeni troops are battling al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which the U.S. regards as one of al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliates. Even so, the same risk as in Iraq applies: Sunni tribes in Yemen may side with AQAP as the lesser of two evils, effectively partitioning the country. There is no clear-cut link between the negotiations on a nuclear deal and U.S.-Iranian co-operation elsewhere. Last week, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Congressional hearing: \"I really don't think that the negotiations, one way or the other, will have much bearing on what [the Iranians] do in Iraq or any place they are trying to exert their influence, meaning Syria or now Yemen.\" In any case, a substantive agreement on Iran's nuclear program does not seem imminent. Ahead of yet another meeting in Switzerland with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javid Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that \"unless Iran is able to make the difficult decisions that will be required, there won't be a deal.\" And he was at pains to insist the U.S. would not settle for anything less than a comprehensive, watertight agreement. \"No deal is better than a bad deal because a bad deal could actually make things less secure,\" Kerry said.

The Portugal winger, who is on a season-long loan at his first club, took his Sporting goal tally to eight in 23 appearances since returning from Old Trafford. The result kept them third in the Primeira Liga and on course for Champions League qualification, though their chances of bridging the 12-point gap to leaders Benfica are slim. Nani celebrates his headed winning goal as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 on Monday night. They were made to work hard by bottom-of-the-table Penafiel, who fought back from two goals down to draw level after Sporting centre-half Tobias Figueiredo was sent off. Having come into the match off the back of a 3-0 loss to Porto, Sporting needed a positive start and goals from William and Islam Slimani had them two the good inside eight minutes. But Figueiredo's red card gave the visitors hope and they replied through veteran midfielder Bruno Braga in the 12th minute. The Manchester United loanee celebrated his 70th-minute winner with a trademark flip. And they levelled three minutes shy of half-time through Vitor Bruno.

She believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. Laura has assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice.", "article": "A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger. 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a \"girlfriend experience\" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' \u2013 which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it \u2013 has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability\u00a0as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles.

Watching the eclipse: The Netherlands' Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander watch the eclipse. Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in a bright crimson ensemble, complete with matching gloves. Impressed: King Willem-Alexander appeared impressed with what he saw, pointing up towards the eclipse. The Dutch royal couple are currently in the middle of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany with Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg on their itinerary. In Britain, millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the Moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic, resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. Is that it? A less enamoured Maxima took off her glasses early and turned away. On tour: The Dutch royals are touring Hamburg today as part of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany. Meeting: They are attending a meeting aimed at boosting Dutch business and trade links. Gas: The royal couple are also being shown a new barge that is fitted out to carry liquefied natural gas.

After a lunchtime reception, they then continued on to the Th\u00fcnen Institute for Organic Farming in Trenthorst, where Maxima came dangerously close to getting her shoe stuck in some silage. Along with watching the eclipse, today's schedule includes a meeting at Hamburg's\u00a0Fischauktionshalle to discuss business opportunities for Dutch firms in Germany. The royals will also be shown a newly-built barge, named the Hummel, which is designed to carry liquefied natural gas. All natural: Yesterday, Maxima came close to treading in some silage (fermented hay) during a farm visit.

Warm welcome: The couple arrived in\u00a0L\u00fcbeck to be met by well-wishers proffering portraits of them. Maxima and Willem-Alexander will also tour the Joop van den Ende Academy, which focuses on innovation  in theatre technology - also a speciality of the Dutch performing arts sector. So keen are the Dutch royals on giving local performers a boost, they flew four dancers from Amsterdam to Copenhagen for a performance on Wednesday night. The men, all from the Het International Choreographic Arts Centre, got their big moment during a banquet hosted by Maxima and Willem-Alexander for the Danish royals. Designed to give Dutch culture a platform, the minimally-clad performers treated Denmark's Queen Margrethe and her family to an unusual modern dance performance.

And it seems the show has even influenced affluent households thousands of miles away in China. Young Chinese people are\u00a0paying \u00a3140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy families hire help, the People's Daily Online reported. Students at the International Butler Academy, in Chengdu, are drilled daily on ironing perfect creases into tablecloths, polishing silverware and identifying the correct cutlery to accompany an eight-course banquet. Students at the International Butler Academy in Chengdu, China, pay \u00a3140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy Chinese families hire help. Tasks also include balancing a platter  and placing food on a plate using just a fork and spoon. Thomas Kaufmann, head instructor at the school, said: 'Downton Abbey is so famous here in China, that is the standard we are measured at. 'In the last few years the demand for butlers has become bigger and bigger. So it is logical for us to have teachers here.' Mr Hu is one of dozens of students who have enrolled in the school's six-week course, which costs 40,000 yuan (\u00a34,300). He previously worked for U.S. casino magnate Steve Wynn, where tasks included wiping fingerprints from his phone and picking out particular chocolates from assortment packs. He said: 'In the whole world there are more and more rich people. And especially in China, they want someone to take care of the smaller things.

Each morning classes start with a round of dusting, cleaning and polishing. Students are also expected to be able to correctly position a water jug. A butter-knife laid a centimetre out of place can lead to failure. Using rulers to make sure the distances are correct is not unknown. Another student Chrissy Yan described the training - especially laying a table - as 'hard'. But she said: 'I want to lead a team of Chinese butlers which will be known worldwide. I want to be asked to travel the world.' The Academy, a beautiful house, opened in response to the increasing demand for domestic servants. Men and women are allowed to train as butlers and complete the same tasks before they finish. Above, two students pour tea. Cutlery, plates and jugs have to be perfectly in line and students fail if they are a centimetre out of place. A butler can typically expect to earn 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,150) a month. Their duties also include more mundane tasks such as fetching groceries, walking the dog, organising cleaning staff and polishing furniture and shoes.

The CNN-sponsored team announced the news on Twitter, showing McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier and Alonso at the team's headquarters in Woking, England. Alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky. McLaren had explained that Alonso's \"accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time.\" After getting back to race preparation in the simulator, McLaren tweeted that it had been a good day for Alonso, \"focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures.\" The media enjoyed a guessing game in Australia about just how Alonso might have reacted to events in Melbourne, where Lewis Hamilton and his mighty Mercedes dominated while Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button finished in last place. Dane Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the recuperating Spaniard, was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid. Alonso left Ferrari at the end of the 2014 season to rejoin McLaren, which is experiencing teething as it renews technical partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda for 2015. In his response on Twitter, Alonso chose to focus on congratulating Spanish rookie Carlos Sainz, who finished ninth on his Toro Rosso debut and who was inspired by Alonso as he plotted his own racing career. \"Congratulations to @carlosainz for the great weekend in Australia!! And of course to Hamilton and Mercedes for the win!! See you in Malaysia,\" Alonso's message read.

The ministry says the tomb, found near the southern city of Luxor, dates back to the New Kingdom of the 18th Dynasty (1543-1292 BC)\u00a0\u2014 the most famous of ancient Egypt dynasties. The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains, between the famed valleys of the Kings and Queens over the town of al-Qurna. Scroll down for video. A team working near the historic city of Luxor has found not one, but two ancient tombs. Both tombs feature astonishing murals which are believed to date back to the 18th Dynasty of the Egyptian New Kingdom. This means the tombs were likely created sometime between 1543-1292BC. The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains. Incredible photographs distributed by the ministry show a tomb with bright green and brown paintings with hieroglyphics with murals that depict both celebrations and everyday activity, and despite their age are still remarkably vibrant and colorful. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damaty said in a statement that the tombs do sadly appear to have been looted at some point and\u00a0the sarcophogi containing the bejeweled mummies were missing. 'The tomb contains many stunning scenes with bright colours painted on plaster,' Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty said in a statement. 'Many of scenes represent the tomb owner and his wife in front of an offering table and a view of a goddess nursing a royal child as well as scenes of the daily life,' he added. The tomb was discovered by a team of American archaeologists alongside an Egyptian inspectors' team in the city of Luxor, 700 kilometres (435 miles) south of Cairo. However, the temple guard's final resting place had been vandalised for unknown reasons. The T-shaped tomb 'was deliberately damaged in ancient times,' said Sultan Eid, the ministry's general director for the Upper Egypt region. 'The name and titles of the tomb owner, some hieroglyphic texts and scenes in addition to the names of the god Amun were deliberately erased,' Eid added. The first tomb was discovered on March 2, and the second was discovered on March 10. The second tomb is believed to be that of Sa-mut and his wife, Ta-Khaeet. The first tomb meanwhile is believed to be that of Sa-Mut's father, Amenhotep. Luxor, a city of some 500,000 people on the banks of the Nile in southern Egypt, is an open-air museum of intricate temples and pharaonic tombs. Eldamaty said in a separate statement that a royal rest house belonging to King Thutmosis II, also from the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom period, had been discovered in the Suez Canal province of Ismailia.

These superstar DJs, they're just like us, you know. Cox, Cook and Howard are just three DJs who took time out of their hectic, jet-setting lives to share their more private passions with British photographer Jessica van der Weert for a charity exhibition raising awareness for the British Tinnitus Association (BTA) \u2013 an organisation that supports people with the debilitating hearing condition that affects almost 10% of UK adults and which affects many DJs. Pop culture photographer van der Weert has spent two years snapping her favourite music men and women, including Annie Mac, Zane Lowe, Paul Oakenfold and Mary Ann Hobbs, for the exhibition which is set to show in Berlin, New York and Ibiza this summer after a standout London debut (complete, of course, with an epic after party). Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - is one of the DJs to be photographed by Jess van der Weert for charity exhibition Flipside. FlipSide, in association with art agents Beautiful Crime and Eddie Lock, combines van der Weert's two loves, music and photography, and is particularly a celebration of the dance music industry, bringing some of the world\u2019s biggest techno, trance and house music DJs and producers out from behind the decks to reveal a rather more private side. While some works feature global music heavies in their other favourite places - Carl Cox doing burnouts in his Lotus, artist Goldie covered in paint in his studio - others feature the superstar DJs re-enacting their fantasies, such as Boy George dressed in full combat gear amidst clouds of purple smoke, re-enacting a scene from Platoon. The photography exhibition - also featuring Boy George - aims to raise awareness for the British Tinnitus Association (BTA) Some of the images feature superstar DJs re-enacting their fantasies, such as Boy George dressed in full combat gear amidst clouds of purple smoke, playing out a scene from Platoon. Norman Cook - aka Fat Boy Slim - is a huge supporter of the project, and was pictured by van der Weert in the changing room of his beloved Brighton FC. The 51-yr-old says: 'It's an original project with some insanely good pictures and it's also for a really great cause.' Other works feature the global music heavies in their other favourite places, like Annie Mac in her dressing room surrounded by clothes and shoes. Zane Lowe and Annie Mac are two of 28 global music professionals who feature in the project by pop art photographer van der Weert. Van der Weert spent two years photographing her favourite artists and in association with art agents Beautiful Crime will take the show on the road this summer, visiting New York, Berlin and Ibiza. Car fan and global music phenomenon\u00a0Carl Cox, 52, says: 'This is not a normal exhibition, this is a celebration of dance music, a collaboration between Jess and ourselves, and the images are personal, big, bold, colourful and fun.' Van Der Weert adds: 'Flipside is an intimate glimpse into the private lives of these global superstars. 'These are my favourite DJs and producers, responsible for bringing us so much utter joy and making life that much better. 'But it's not just about me having a great time with my favourite artists, Flipside has a serious aim too. Tinnitus is a condition that affects 8% of individuals and can ruin lives. As clubbers and DJs we are far more likely to be affected and so this worldwide exhibition aims to raise awareness of the condition, how to avoid it in the first place, and most importantly how to cope with it if you already have it.'

{"abstract": "The Morning Glory pool in Yellowstone National Park has changed from a brilliant blue to a yellowy-green hue due to years of vandalism by visitors. The accumulation of coins, rubbish and natural debris has clogged up the pool's underwater vents, affecting water circulation and decreasing the temperature of the waters.

Once a brilliant shade of blue, the Morning Glory pool's appearance has altered dramatically since the 1950s, thanks to an accumulation of coins, rubbish and natural debris. The pool has been dubbed the Fading Glory, due to the transformation from its original colour to the yellowy-green hue it has today. Scroll down for video. Morning Glory in the Yellowstone National Park was once a brilliant shade of blue, but now owes its yellow tinge to debris and coins thrown in over the years. The Morning Glory hot spring in 1940. The photograph reveals a stark contrast to the fiery colours now exhibited at the tourist attraction. The popular tourist attraction sees three million visitors flock to gaze at its psychedelic waters in Wyoming, USA. The site first gained popularity in the 1940s when a million tourists would visit the site. Pool on fire! The fierce colours are influenced by how light interacts with the water\u2019s depth, with yellow and orange colours in the shallows and green in the deep waters. The rainbow hot spring has been clogged up with debris, which block the heat vents, and affecting the water circulation in the pool. It is estimated that the destruction of the hot spring has been building up for decades. Research by Montana State University and Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany helped to create a model that could depict the hot spring's colours from over a century ago, when it was less frequented by visitors. Now nearly three million tourists flock to Yellowstone National Park, compared to the one million in the 1940s, which has led to the build-up of debris in the pool. As the underwater vents started to get clogged up, water circulation was affected, decreasing the temperature of the waters and causing a migration of the orange-coloured bacteria towards the centre. Adam Hoffman from Science Friday said: 'Pigments produced by swaths of those microbes\u2014called microbial mats\u2014are responsible, at least in part, for the brilliant yellows, greens, and oranges that now tinge Morning Glory and other thermal pools in Yellowstone.' Photographs from 1966 show the Upper Geyser Basin  pool's original blue colour, before the build up of coins and rubbish. The pool\u00a0received\u00a0its name in 1883 from Mrs McGowan, who was the wife of Assistant Park Superintendent, Charles McGowan. As a nod to its then crystal blue colour, she named it after the blue flower, Morning Glory. Although it was originally known by its Latin name, Convolutus, by 1889 it was commonly known by its current name. Over three million people enjoy the Yellowstone National Park annually,\u00a0spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles, comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and mountain ranges. Unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface, Morning Glory will never be fully blue again.

Mellor allegedly accused Keenan of lying in her book, Broken, where she revealed the abuse she suffered as a child. The trial is expected to last two weeks.", "article": "Penny Mellor, 53, (pictured arriving at Chelmsford Crown Court today) is accused of sending abuse online to anti-paedophile campaigner Shy Keenan. An anti-paedophile campaigner was bombarded with online messages claiming she lied in her bestselling misery memoir by a woman who had developed an 'obsession' with her, a court heard. Penny Mellor, 53, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, allegedly attacked Shy Keenan through Twitter, emails and a blog, claiming she had fabricated an account of childhood sexual abuse. Ms Keenan, from Colchester, Essex, who describes herself as a justice campaigner, wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. The revelation led to the conviction of Stanley Claridge and others in 2002 and Ms Keenan set up her own organisation, Phoenix Post, with campaigner Sara Payne, whose daughter was murdered. She also worked as a columnist for the Sun and revealed her early life on a BBC Newsnight programme. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Mellor accused Ms Keenan of repeatedly lying in her book, claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker. Mellor denies stalking Ms Keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between January 1 and 16 March 2013 by sending tweets, publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on Ms Keenan's day to day activities. Prosecutor Tony Abell, opening the case to the jury, said the law against cyber stalking via social media under which Mellor was being tried only came into effect in January 2013. He said Mellor appeared 'to have developed something of an obsession with Shy Keenan and embarked upon a very personal campaign against her'. He said the tweets were personal and offensive and continued: 'She has accused her repeatedly of lying in the book \"Broken\". 'She has suggested Ms Keenan has groomed individuals, implied that she\u00a0suffers from Munchausen's By Proxy and referred to her post traumatic stress disorder. 'Emails contain private information which Shy Keenan regards as sensitive, including copies of marriage certificates, addresses and the like.' Shy Keenan (pictured)\u00a0wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. Mellor allegedly claimed that Ms Keenan'repeatedly lied' in her book. Mr Abell said Ms Keenan felt concerned about her own and her family's personal safety because the information might help other people with grudges against her. She had installed extra security and had had to go back on anti-depressants. The jury heard  Mellor was a campaigner against false allegations of Munchausen by Proxy, where parents were the victims of false claims from their own children, for organisation Dare to Care. In 1998 to 1999, Mellor and Ms Keenan were in close communication but they fell out. Ms Keenan thought that Mellor's work might be offering support to real child abusers. The two women didn't have any contact again until late 2012. Mr Abell said the trigger was Ms Keenan writing in her Sun column in October 2012, following the Jimmy Savile scandal, that she had mentioned to Esther Rantzen many years before of rumours about his inappropriate behaviour. Shy Keenan (right) with Dr Sara Payne (left), whose daughter was murdered by a paedophile, work together at her organisation, Phoenix Post. Mellor then began tweeting that Ms Keenan 'had told lies in her book Broken', said the prosecutor. Mellor emailed recipients including the BBC, Newsnight, the Sun, the Guardian, Broken's publisher Hodder & Stoughton and Ms Keenan's literary agent. She was appealing to them to 'investigate' her claims of inaccuracies in Broken and sent 239 tweets from January to March 2013. Mellor is to have accused Ms Keenan of 'lying and cheating for years' and that she 'cons everyone and hides behind that abuse'. The court heard she described the graphic abuse Ms Keenan wrote about in her\u00a0book as 'titillation' for paedophiles and not the sort of thing a mother should publish for her own children to read. Mellor wrote that Ms Keenan'seeks attention, she needs to be adored and revered in order to get money', the jury was told. 'That's a flavour of the sort of bile which was coming out of Penny Mellor over this period,' said Mr Abell.'It sought to attack Ms Keenan's credibility as a victim of sexual abuse, causing her distress and concern by revealing personal information. Mellor was given a verbal warning by Essex Police in December 2012 but after a brief respite, the cyber attacks began again in January.

Now a new study has found a link between testosterone and the caring side of men when they return home from the 'hunt'. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home. The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Pictured is a family who was involved in the study.\u00a0Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle. The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer. The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle which revolves around small, tight-knit communities that produce their own food. 'Our goal was to look at the interaction between different hormones in motivating behaviour in a naturalistic context,' said Adrian Jaeggi, co-lead author at University of California, Santa Barbara. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home.\u00a0The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer, and linked with changes in testosterone (pictured) 'Hunting for subsistence and sharing meat is something people have done for hundreds of thousands of years.' Previous studies have shown that oxytocin makes people more cooperative while testosterone has the opposite effect. Jaeggi said he expected to see a trade-off between the two hormones and was surprised to find the positive relationship between them. When a man tells his wife or girlfriend she looks nice, it\u2019s not because of her new haircut. Instead, it\u2019s his hormones doing the talking. A study found that a whiff of the \u2018love chemical\u2019 oxytocin made men rate their partners as being more attractive. And German researchers recently said that oxytocin may also play a key role in monogamy, a trait that is rare among mammals, other than ourselves. The University of Bonn scientists showed 40 young men who claimed to be passionately in love pictures of their partners. They were asked how attractive they found the women after being given a placebo spray to sniff and a burst of oxytocin. Pictures of strangers and of long-term acquaintances, such as work colleagues were also shown. The men, who were in long-term relationships, also underwent scans to check how much the brain areas responsible for rewarding feelings lit up. Lead author Dirk Scheele said: \u2018When the men received the oxytocin instead of placebo, the reward system in the brain was very active when viewing their partner and they perceived them as more attractive than other women. \u2018We did not detect this effect with pictures of long-standing acquaintances.\u2019 According to Jaeggi and co-lead author Ben Trumble, high testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a 'winner effect' experienced by men making a kill. It could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as the Tsimane. In either case, the increased oxytocin could serve as a balance to make the hunters kinder, more generous and more willing to share their bounty. 'Almost half a century ago, it was famously documented that successful Kung hunters were jokingly insulted by others in order to 'cool their hearts' to'make (them) gentle,' lest pride or boasting disrupt the egalitarian social system common to many foragers,' said senior co-author Michael Gurven. 'Here we observe a potential hormonal analogue consistent with the type of levelling behaviour seen in hunter-gatherer societies.' Another use for both hormones may have to do with post-hunt recovery. Both are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity. 'These men are coming home, they're finished with work for the day, and they're about to eat and share food,' Jaeggi continued. 'So the need to be social coincides with the need to regenerate and it would make sense for the same hormones to facilitate both functions.' To conduct the study, Trumble joined the hunters as they went out into the jungle and attempted to make a kill to feed their families. He then took saliva specimens along the way, collecting them at exact intervals. The oxytocin was measured in the UCSB Human Biodemography Laboratory. Though the sample size is 'not huge,' he and Jaeggi noted, the study 'definitely adds to the current literature in which the interplay between testosterone and oxytocin is often overlooked.'

A former gas station employee and janitor in Vermont who died last June aged 92 had secretly amassed a fortune of around $8 million thanks to a hidden talent for picking successful stocks. Ronald Read's fortune only became public knowledge after his death when he bequeathed $6 million to his local library and hospital. During his lifetime Read was known to friends and neighbors as a man who sometimes held his coat together with safety pins and had a long-time habit of foraging for firewood. Read, who worked for almost 25 years at Haviland's service station in Brattleboro, was known for his flannel jacket and baseball cap. His most expensive possession was a 2007 Toyota Yaris valued at $5,000, which gave no hint of the size of his  fortune. 'If he could save a penny, he would,' Bridget Bokum, a senior associate at his local Wells Fargo Advisors office told WSJ. Bokum together with Claire Johns, the executor of Read's will, is currently going through a five-inch-thick stack of stock certificates to determine his exact worth. 'We all knew he was into the stock market, but not to this extent,' said Johns. The secret to Read's financial success was that a well as being a shrewd stock picker, he also displayed remarkable frugality and patience with his shares. At the time of his death Read owned at least 95 stocks, many of which he had held for decades. The secret to Read's success was that a well as being a good stock picker, he displayed remarkable frugality and patience with stocks including Procter & Gamble. He had invested across a variety of sectors, including railroads, utility companies, banks, health care, telecom and consumer products but had avoided technology stocks. When Read received dividend checks in the mail he plowed the money back into more shares, said Bokum. Among his longtime holdings were Procter & Gamble, J.P. Morgan Chase, General Electric and Dow Chemical. At the time of his death, Read also had large stakes in J.M. Smucker, CVS Health and Johnson & Johnson. His portfolio also included some notable failures including Lehman Brothers Holdings, which famously collapsed during the financial crisis in 2008. One of the keys for Read's success was that he was prepared to stick with his picks for long periods of time. In 1959 he bought 39 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric for about $2,380 and  they are now worth about $10,735.\u00a0At the time of his death, he owned 578 shares in PG&E, worth just over $26,500. When Read died last year he also had large stakes in companies including Johnson & Johnson. Secret millionaire in their midst: Ronald Read, (left, in his trademark baseball cap), pictured eating Christmas Dinner at the American Legion in Vermont a few years before his death. Stepson Phillip Brown, of Somersworth, New Hampshire, told the Brattleboro Reformer that the only indication Brown had of Read's investments was his regular reading of the Wall Street Journal. 'I was tremendously surprised,' Brown said of Read's hidden wealth. 'He was a hard worker, but I don't think anybody had an idea that he was a multi-millionaire.' Read relied on subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal and Barron's for his investment knowledge, although he also made good use of his local library to which he has  bequeathed $1.2 million. He also donated $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and made a number of smaller bequests. 'It's pretty incredible. This is not something that happens on a regular basis,' said the hospital's development director, Gina Pattison. Gas station employee: Ronald \u00a0Read worked at Haviland's service station for 25 years and even met his wife there in 1960 for whom he was married for 10 years until she died in 1970. This Google street view shows Ronald Read's modest home and that may even be him pictured in the right corner near his Toyota parked outside. Read was born in Dummerston in 1921. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, walking and hitchhiking about four miles each way from his home to the high school in Brattleboro. After military service during World War II, he returned to Brattleboro where he worked at a service station for 25 years then worked for 17 years as a janitor at the local J.C. Penney. In 1960 he married a woman he met at the service station but she died in 1970.", "candidates": [["A 92-year-old man in Vermont, Ronald Read, has secretly amassed a fortune of around $8 million thanks to his talent for picking successful stocks.

Daniel Keyworth, 16, had hoped to continue his studies with A-Levels at Wickersley School in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after completing his summer's exams. However, the teenager, who has a number of medical conditions and underwent facial surgery twice last year, had his application refused because of his high absence record. 'Last year he had a bit of time off because of his operations and other medical conditions,' said Daniel's mother Tracy, 48. Daniel Keyworth, 16, has been told he cannot sit his A-Levels at Wickersley Academy in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after missing too many lessons. But his mother, Tracy, pictured, said his low attendance was due to doctor's orders. 'When he's not well, I've always had him to the doctor. It's always been the doctor's advice. 'When they tell me to keep him off school, that's what I do. 'I'm a single parent with no transport, so when he's been at Sheffield Children's Hospital, it takes us three buses each way to get to appointments. 'I've done everything right and in Daniel's interests. That's what makes this so upsetting.' In February last year Daniel had a septoplasty - a corrective procedure to straighten the nasal septum. He needed the same procedure revised in July, when cartilage from his ear was put in his nose. Daniel missed two weeks' school while recovering each time. His other complaints include Raynaud's phenomenon, which affects the blood supply to the fingers and toes, asthma, eczema and a list of allergies. Daniel's mother said she didn't'really know what to make of it' after her son's application to stay on at Wickersley School, pictured, \u00a0was rejected. Tracy, from Rotherham, said it felt like there had been a tug of war between ensuring Daniel went to school and taking care of his ailments. After he was rejected, she said: 'I don't really know what to make of it. 'I've written letters but don't know what else to do. Daniel enjoys school. 'He likes photography, graphics and science and he wants to do A-Levels after his exams. 'He's been getting there, slowly, and doing his best.' Tracy said Daniel's progress had also been hampered by the school losing coursework for graphics and photography. A Wickersley School spokeswoman said: 'We have no comment to make.' The septum is the structure that separates the right and left nostrils in the nose. It is made up of cartilage  at the front and bone further back. The septum is important in maintaining the shape of your nose. If the septum is bent or damaged it can cause a blockage or inflammation within the nose which can turn to mucus and a nasal drip. A septoplasty procedure involves operating inside the nose to straighten the septum. It involves a doctor exposing the bone or cartilage that is causing the blockage. The obstruction is then removed or straightened. Most patients who have the operation, which lasts between 30 minutes and an hour, are able to go home the same day.

Naseer Chawki, who claims to be 34 and from Iran, was detained for more than four years while Home Office officials fought for deportation, after he was convicted of sexually abusing two women on a rush-hour Piccadilly Line train. But he has now won a High Court battle against Home Secretary Theresa May, after a judge ruled that he had been illegally held for seven months - against his human rights - during that process. Naseer Chawki, who sexually assaulted two women on a rush-hour Tube, could be awarded \u00a37,000 after the High Court (pictured) ruled he was unlawfully held for ten months while officials tried to deport him. Deputy High Court Judge Stephen Morris said Chawki's payout is yet to be assessed, giving no indication of what the figure would be. But according to human rights lawyers, the payout given to Chawki could be between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000. In 2013, a Supreme Court judgment set a precedent that those detained illegally should receive around \u00a31,000 for each month they are held against their human rights. It means Chawki can expect to receive around \u00a37,000. During today's hearing in London, the court heard how Chawki - who has failed in a bid to claim asylum - arrived in Cardiff from Iran in 1999 before moving to Liverpool. He then moved to Seven Sisters, north London. The court heard how, in November 2008, Chawki was given a three-year jail term for carrying out two sex assaults on the London Underground, as well as possessing a false identity document. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) had claimed Chawki was held because he posed a'serious risk' to the public but has lost the case. Chawki had pleaded guilty to the offences, after he pressed himself against the women on a crowded rush-hour train. The attacks had been witnessed by commuters and Chawki was later traced using DNA evidence and Oyster card records. During the hearing over those offences, the court heard how the 'revolting' sex attacks had had'very lasting effects' on the victims. Judge Martin Beddoe, who heard the case at Southwark Crown Court, said he would recommend deportation after he had served time in jail for the crimes. Chawki was then released from jail in December 2009. Following an order for his deportation, he was placed in immigration detention, while officials began the process. But he was released from immigration detention in March last year after attempts to deport him failed. He was made to wear a monitoring tag. After his release, Chawki launched a legal battle, claiming he had been held in immigration detention when then was 'no prospect' of him being deported. Mrs May disputed his claim, saying he posed a'serious risk of harm' and that there was a'serious risk' that he would abscond. Judge Morris ruled that detention had been lawful for the majority of the four years and four months Chawki was held. But he ruled that the detention had been unlawful between mid-September 2013 and March last year. He said that, by that time, there had been 'no sufficient prospect of removal within a reasonable time'. During the 2013 case which set the precedent on the issue of payouts, the Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of State had breached the human rights of Mr Faulkner by keeping him in detention for 10 months longer than necessary. Mr Faulkner was serving a life sentence but had brought the case over the delay in reviewing the need for his further detention, on the grounds of whether it was necessary for public protection. The Secretary of State was ordered to pay him \u00a310,000 in damages, setting a precedent of around \u00a31,000 in damages per month held unlawfully.", "candidates": [["A legal battle has resulted in a \u00a37,000 payout for Naseer Chawki, an illegal immigrant who committed sex offences on the London Underground.

A 22-year-old Saudi student was caught driving through Hyde Park in his father's custom made McLaren supercar, after he had been smoking cannabis in the early hours. Mohammad Al-Sharif was stopped by police as he drove through the London park and confessed to having taken drugs at 7.30am that morning, when officers found he was unsteady on his feet and slurring his words. The 22-year-old had been driving his father's limited edition McLaren car, which is worth around \u00a3168,500. The supercar, which goes from 0mph to 60mph in 2.8 seconds had been given a makeover to make it even more powerful. It was also a previous winner of 'best supercar' in\u00a0the Middle East's Car of the Year awards. Business student Al-Sharif, who lives off a family allowance, admitted driving while in unfit through drugs and was fined \u00a3400. He was also disqualified from driving for a year. Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard that he was stopped at about 10.40am on December 11 last year because he was seen driving 'erratically.' Mr Gill said:\u00a0'He was spoken to and there was a strong smell of cannabis coming from the car, he was the sole occupier. 'He was unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred when he spoke and he appeared intoxicated. 'He was asked if he had been smoking cannabis and said he had at 7.30 that morning. 'He was arrested and taken to Paddington Green Police Station and searched and a small amount of cannabis was found that he admitted was his.' A blood test found Al-Sharif had used cannabis and another drug, which is believed to have been prescription drugs. He was found to be driving on a Saudi Arabia-issued International Driving Licence, which ironically was not valid in his home country.

He has no income and survives with the financial support from his family in Saudi Arabia. Al-Sharif was spotted driving a McLaren MP4-12c 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8 Velocita Wind Edition. In the Middle East\u2019s Car of the Year awards the vehicle won \u2018Best Supercar\u2019 and overall \u2018Car of the Year\u2019 for 2012.

The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa.", "article": "(CNN)The attack on Tunisia's famed Bardo Museum is just the latest evidence that parts of North and sub-Saharan Africa have become a magnet for Islamist extremism. Tunisia -- lying just across the Mediterranean from Europe, but bordered on one side by Libya and on the other by Algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years. But it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of Islamist extremism has intensified in the region. Islamist terrorists also have struck in Algeria, where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013, and in Libya, where terrorists killed the U.S. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where ISIS has established a beachhead in the east. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has its roots in Algeria, has captured territory in Mali and taken hostages -- often Europeans -- in countries such as Niger and Mauritania. So what is the world doing about it? The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa. France has sent troops to Mali. And, as CNN recently reported from Chad, Western militaries have trained special forces from several northern African nations to take on the Islamists. Here's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how Islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of Africa. Algeria is home to a long-running Islamist insurgency. In perhaps the highest-profile incident, Islamist militants attacked the In Amenas oil and gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the remote facility. Dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege. The attack was the work of the Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the \"Signatories in Blood Brigade.\" Last September, another Islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, after seizing him as he walked in Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. Days earlier, the outfit -- Jund al Khilafa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Militants affiliated with AQIM had previously also kidnapped foreigners in Algeria, including Italians and Spaniards. In 2007, AQIM launched a suicide bombing campaign in Algeria, which included a deadly bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Algiers. In January, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. Besides its growing presence in Tripoli, ISIS is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Before the advent of ISIS, an Islamist group called Ansar al Shariah was blamed by the United States for carrying out the September 11,  2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. State Department computer expert Sean Smith and former U.S. Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, then acting as security contractors, also died. In 2012, Islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in Mali after a military coup and uprising by Tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. France intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the Islamists. Since then, Mali's government has battled various rebel factions, mostly in its northern region, with the help of French and African forces. Recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital, Bamako, which killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. AQIM issued a warning to France via jihadist websites in January, following terror attacks in Paris, stating that \"France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,\" citing the presence of its soldiers in Mali. According to analysis by Jane's Defence Weekly, despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward Libya, \"Mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with France and Algeria.\" Jihadist groups including AQIM and the Mulathameen Brigade operate in the porous border areas between Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya. Militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom, including three Spaniards in 2011, according to Jane's.

Ashley Williams was on Arsenal\u2019s radar for ages before signing a new four-year deal at Swansea last summer, but a move to the Emirates fell through supposedly because he wasn\u2019t considered Champions League quality. The 30-year-old has made a nonsense of that verdict since with his performances for Wales. Brilliant in a defiant defensive display when they gained a 0-0 draw away to Group B favourites Belgium in November, the Welsh captain was again outstanding in the 3-0 win in Israel which put Chris Coleman\u2019s side top of the group. While Gareth Bale grabbed the headlines, Williams was superb at the back. He gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes \u2013 and won it back both times. Ashley Williams (right, pictured with Gareth Bale) was in impressive form during Wales' win against Israel. 2. John Terry is clearly a far more decent bloke than the various unsavoury episodes of his past would suggest. At the age of 34 and with a back that needs constant treatment, Chelsea\u2019s captain could have done with a weekend off after playing all but four of Chelsea\u2019s 45 games so far this season. But he gave up his time to play 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard\u2019s All Star charity game supporting various good causes in the Merseyside area. Terry was also first to agree to play when Stiliyan Petrov ran out a sell-out game in Glasgow 18 months ago to raise funds for Leukaemia research. John Terry, pictured with Mario Balotelli, played 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard's All Star charity match. 3. Nathaniel Clyne might have to rein in some of the attacking instincts that have worked so well for him at Southampton when he\u2019s wearing an England shirt. The 23-year-old is beginning to look like a natural at right back for Roy Hodgson after winning his third cap in the 4-0 win over Lithuania. But Hodgson clearly asked Clyne to keep his position to let opposite full back Leighton Baines do most of the marauding forward. The Everton man played 53 passes in the forward half, nearly twice the number (28) that Clyne did. England ace Nathaniel Clyne may have to keep his position in order to let Leighton Baines maraud forward. 4. Portugal might have gone top of Group I with their 2-1 victory over Serbia but new boss Fernando Santos could do with finding some fresh talent for his squad. Seven of the side that started the game, including Cristiano Ronaldo, were already in their country\u2019s senior squad for Euro 2008. Portugal have failed to significantly freshen up their international squad since Euro 2008. 5. There must be something about the north London air because if Harry Kane can\u2019t stop scoring goals, the same is true of Olivier Giroud. Arsenal\u2019s centre forward, who has 11 goals from 13 starts for his club since the start of 2015, was on the scoresheet again for France as they beat Denmark 2-0 in a Sunday night friendly. Kane, certain to get his first full England start in Italy after his dramatic 79-second debut goal against Lithuania, has 14 from 14 starts for Spurs since New Year\u2019s Day. Harry Kane and Olivier Giroud flew the flag for north London by scoring for England and France respectively. 6. Andrew Robertson\u2019s return from injury could be a key in helping Hull battle away from the relegation zone in the last two months of the season. The 21-year-old left back, picked up from Dundee United last summer by Steve Bruce for a bargain \u00a32.8million, showed he is back to full match fitness with a dazzling display for Scotland. He played 100 passes in all during the win over Gibraltar, with 93 of them reaching a team-mate \u2013 and 49 of them in the attacking half of the field. Hull full back Andrew Roberton impressed against Gibraltar following his return to full match fitness. 7. Notts County say they are going to name a new manager this week with 50-year-old Dutchman Ricardo Moniz, once on Tottenham\u2019s coaching staff, the current bookies\u2019 favourite to get the job. They might be better off forgetting that and sticking with the experienced figure of Paul Hart who stepped up from working with the Academy for a one-off day as caretaker boss against relegation rivals Scunthorpe. The 61-year-old made a dramatic difference, lifting County out of the relegation zone with a 2-2 draw \u2013 and only a late Niall Canavan goal stopped him taking all three points. Notts County look set to appoint former Tottenham coach\u00a0Ricardo Moniz following\u00a0Shaun Derry's exit. 8.

We in the UK cannot just watch as another country burns in the Middle East, strengthening the forces of extremist and violence. 'The Houthi rebels have brought the country to its knees. Yemen is facing an economic and humanitarian catastrophe. We are witnessing an implosion in one of the most strategically vital countries in the world.'

{"abstract": "Mexican wrestler Hijo del Perro Aguayo, whose real name is Pedro Aguayo Ramirez, died at the age of 35 after collapsing during a bout. He was kicked by one of his opponents, Rey Mysterio, and left slumped against the ropes. The cause of his death is still unknown and an investigation into possible manslaughter has been opened.", "article": "(CNN)The world of Mexican wrestling wrestling has been deeply shaken by the death of star fighter Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who collapsed after being kicked during a bout. The lucha libre fighter, whose real name is Pedro Aguayo Ramirez, was left slumped against the ropes after a flying kick from one of his opponents, Rey Mysterio, during the match Friday night. The other wrestlers continued with the fight as Aguayo's limp body slid down onto the mat, according to video footage of the bout posted on social media. The video showed ringside personnel repeatedly shaking Aguayo and talking to him without any response. He eventually received medical attention and was rushed out of the arena in the city of Tijuana. But doctors were unable to revive him. AAA, the wrestling promotion company for which Aguayo worked, said it was informed of his death around 1 a.m. Saturday. He was 35 years old. \"Mexican lucha libre is in mourning over the death of one of its star talents,\" the AAA said in a statement. Questions remained over what exactly caused Aguayo's death and why it took so long for him to receive medical treatment. Ernesto Franco, the duty doctor at the fight, told Mexico's state news agency Notimex that at the time of Aguayo's collapse, he was attending to other injured wrestlers, according to CNN Mexico. Franco said Aguayo's injury was the result of a blow to the neck region, adding that he spent about an hour trying to revive him using \"all possible resuscitation measures.\" The Associated Press reported that the state prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into possible manslaughter. The AAA said Friday's fight was organized by another promotion company named The Crash. Aguayo's death prompted an outpouring of grief on social media from fans and members of the wrestling industry. \"I will miss you and carry you with me for the rest of my life,\" tweeted Rey Mysterio, who landed the flying kick on Aguayo. \"Rest in peace, Hijo del Perro.\" He posted two images on Instagram that appeared to show him and Aguayo at a young age and again later in life. \"I had the privilege to share a ring for the first time with Hijo del Perro Aguayo in his debut as a professional wrestler and an honor to be in the ring with this great legend for the last time!\" he wrote. \"You will be missed, Perro.\" WWE wrestler Mark Henry tweeted, \"Respect to fallen brother in arms!\" \"I and the WWE universe pray for your peace and comfort to your family!\" Henry wrote. Aguayo is the son of one of the giants of Mexican wrestling, Pedro \"Perro\" Aguayo. The younger Aguayo began his career in 1995 at the age 15, according to the AAA. But he emerged from his father's shadow to become a big name in his own right. \"El Hijo del Perro Aguayo was among the most decorated AAA stars in recent memory as a three-time Mexican National Tag Team champion as well as a former Mexican National Light Heavyweight champion and Mexican National Atomicos champion,\" wrote Bleacher Report columnist  Mike Chiari. \"There is no question that El Hijo del Perro Aguayo was among the most popular and successful luchadores in Mexico,\" Chiari said.", "candidates": [["Mexican wrestling fighter Hijo del Perro Aguayo has died at the age of 35 after collapsing during a bout.

The number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in Birmingham more than doubled in a four-year period. Gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the NHS when a patient's life is deemed to be at risk.", "article": "Teenagers as young as 16 in Birmingham have undergone weight loss surgery (file picture) Obese teenagers as young as 16 have had NHS-funded gastric band operations, worrying new figures show. And in a four-year period, the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in Birmingham more than doubled. Gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the NHS when a patient's life is deemed to be at risk. Such surgery is a last resort, and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally. The guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone. Meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go-ahead for surgery. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre released under the Freedom of Information Act show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. Overall between 2008-09 and 2011-12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase. It comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year. Since 2011, 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Last year it emerged that West Midlanders are the second fattest group in the whole country, with NHS England figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese. New figures released in January this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in Birmingham are  officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11. Concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an 'easy option' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle, eating more healthily and taking exercise. NHS guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has 'life threatening obesity' - a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, or a BMI of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. The policy states: 'It is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards. 'Due to these associated risks, most surgeons, whether they are working privately or for the NHS, would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not just for cosmetic reasons.' People can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately. A gastric band operation, which reduces the size of the stomach, costs up to \u00a38,000. Meanwhile, a full gastric bypass, which re-routes the digestive system meaning a person can digest much less food, costs around \u00a315,000. In the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. which includes gastric bands abd bypasses. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. The NHS has warned that the treatment is available more cheaply overseas, but added it carries increased risks. Current statistics suggest that there is a one in 1,000 risk of death from weight loss surgery within 30 days. Nationally 16 teenagers under the age of 17 underwent stomach surgery in the last five years. Responding to figures revealing a rise in obese newborns,\u00a0Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions, which increase the size of the baby, most just overeat. He said: 'Quite simply, the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing. 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight. 'As they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is a continuous upwards spiral. 'Successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem. It starts at conception and sometimes even before then.' Mr Fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies. He said: 'Some babies are so fat they cannot come out naturally. 'Women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation. 'If we get it wrong, it's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on.' MailOnline has contacted NHS Midlands and East for comment.

Laurent Blanc\u2019s future as manager at PSG will hang in the balance, as will the competing philosophies at the respective clubs. In a battle of old money versus new money it\u2019s not often Roman Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea are consigned to the former category, the frugal, traditional team taking on the gaudy spendthrifts. Laurent Blanc's position as PSG manager is under threat despite domestic dominance in France. Branislav Ivanovic's crucial away goal has given Chelsea the edge in the tie ahead of Wednesday's game. But with Chelsea having grown out of their own age of extravagance, it is Qatari-backed PSG who have fallen foul of UEFA\u2019s new Financial Fair Play rules. When Jose Mourinho makes his barbed comments about clubs which \u2018think they can over-ride what Financial Fair Play says\u2019 he has PSG in his sights as much as Manchester City. And perhaps understandably so; despite being fined, like Manchester City, \u00a349 million for breaching the FFP rules, told by UEFA to break even by 2016, to not increase their wage bill and to limit transfers, the club managed to spend \u00a343m on Luiz. And, according to reports in France, the club\u2019s provisional budget for turnover next season has risen again to \u00a3350million after increased sponsorship deals with Nike, Emirates, Nivea, Huawei, Pure Essential and Mumm \u2013 all in addition to the disputed \u00a3150m four-year deal they have with the Qatar Tourist Authority, which UEFA refused to accept was a fair market price for a secondary sponsor. Jose Mourinho has complained about the Paris club's extensive spending, but FFP has had little impact. Former France defender Blance knows his bosses expect the team to progress beyond the last 16. PSG captain Thiago Silva has spoken of his desire for the club to challenge Europe's major powers. All of which leads the club to believe that their dream of winning the Champions League within the next few years can be achieved. \u2018I do not think the project here is stalling at all, it was always going to be a big project,\u2019 said Thiago Silva, captain and Luiz\u2019s defensive partner. \u2018The owners aim is to have us on the same level as Real Madrid and Bayern. We know that we have the players to be able to win the Champions League, and even with the very difficult game against Chelsea - we have to believe that this year can be our year.\u2019 That goal appeared a distinct possibility when Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side ran Barcelona close in the Champions League quarter finals in 2013, being knocked out on away goals. And when they beat Chelsea 3-1 at Parc de Princes in the first leg of the quarter final meeting last year, they appeared to be continuing their growth. But a 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge saw them ejected from the competition and they are now are in danger of exiting in the last 16. Silva praised the professionalism of his team-mate, and former Chelsea defender, David Luiz (right) Luiz was on the other side when the teams met in the quarter final last year, when Chelsea progressed. PSG will take heart from the first leg in Parc des Princes, where Chelsea were hanging on to the 1-1 draw by the end and the fact that last year PSG were missing an injured Ibrahimovich at Stamford Bridge. \u2018We are better equipped than last year to beat Chelsea,\u2019 said Thiago Silva. \u2018Even if you look at the game in Paris, we were the better team no doubt. If it was not for an unbelievable performance from their goalkeeper we would have won the game and would be travelling to London with the lead, we must take heart from that. \u2018David Luiz is very excited to go back to Chelsea. He had great memories there, he helped them to win the Champions League - so I would be very surprised if the Chelsea fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception. Javier Pastore looked to have given PSG a winning lead in the first leg last season, but Chelsea hit back. Demba Ba's last-gasp goal put Chelsea through, but PSG are confident they can win this time around. Lionel Messi scores against PSG in 2013, when it looked like the French side were on the brink of Europe's elite.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan has directed a lower-court judge to consider whether the lawsuit she threw out should be transferred to Oklahoma, saying she has authority to do so. The court's order on Thursday came as the school found itself amid a racial controversy after video of fraternity students engaged in a racist chant spread across the Internet. Dr. Leone-Noelle Meyer\u00a0maintained she is entitled to Pissarro's 1886 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' because it belonged to her father when it was taken by the Nazis as Germany moved across France. University President David Boren ordered a fraternity house closed and expelled two of its members after reviewing clips of the chant that referenced lynching and said blacks would never be allowed in the fraternity. The school and Boren are defendants in the lawsuit brought in 2013 by 75-year-old Holocaust survivor Leone Meyer, who lives in Paris. She maintained she is entitled to Pissarro's 1886 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' because it belonged to her father when it was taken by the Nazis as Germany moved across France. Her father, Raoul Mayer, died in 1970. Swiss records show Meyer's father in Paris had owned the painting. But a Swiss court ruled that the painting's post-war owners had properly established ownership and rejected her claim. Bequeathed to OU by Clara Weitzenhoffer, the wife of oil tycoon Aaron Weitzenhoffer, the school displayed it publicly for over a decade.

In an emailed statement Saturday, Oklahoma University spokeswoman Catherine F. Bishop said: 'The University is continuing its efforts to work with the plaintiffs to determine all the facts in this matter, some of which may still be unknown, and to seek a mutually agreeable resolution.' Last year, Boren defended Oklahoma University's ownership, saying the school does not want to keep any items it does not legitimately own but also wants to avoid a bad precedent by automatically giving away gifts it receives to anyone who claims them. Boren and the school have opposed the lawsuit on largely procedural grounds, saying the school has sovereign immunity and that Meyer was not diligent in pursuing her claim and had sued in New York rather than Oklahoma as a 'forum shopping strategy' to avoid Oklahoma's more restrictive statute of limitations. Several Oklahoma lawmakers who authored a resolution in the state Legislature seeking to force the school to turn the painting over have spoken out against the university's position. In a letter to the people of Oklahoma, Meyer has said her quest 'has nothing to do with money. It is about justice and a duty to remember.' Pierre Ciric, a lawyer for Meyer, said Saturday he welcomed 'any progress toward the resolution of our client's claim.' 'It appears that everyone involved with this case agrees that `La Bergere' was the property of my client's father prior to the Nazi occupation of France, which we have asserted since the complaint was filed,' he said.

Claire Dean, 43, noticed an insect bite on her hip while gardening in September last year, but thought nothing of it. A few days later she began suffering mysterious flu-like symptoms, and  soon found herself in crippling pain. A few days later she woke up with numb cheeks and noticed her face was paralysed - to the point where she looked unrecognisable  in the mirror. She was in such agony she had to quit her job as a cleaner and  was hospitalised for two weeks. Claire Dean, 43, was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a tick while gardening in September last year. She is pictured with daughter Alexandra, 21. Ms Dean remembers being bitten on her hip but thought nothing of it. Days later, she suffered flu-like symptoms which became worse until she was in agony. After carrying out tests, doctors discovered the mother-of-two had developed\u00a0Lyme disease,\u00a0a\u00a0bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. She was prescribed antibiotics and underwent months of physiotherapy to help strengthen the muscles in her face - and is now telling her story to warn others of the dangers of tick bites. On the day she was bitten she had been wearing jeans and a baggy jumper, which she believes the tick must have become caught in. Ms Dean, from Castle Douglas, Scotland, said: 'I was in agony. The bites themselves weren't itchy or painful, so I didn't think they were the cause at first. 'I'm quite an active person and just put the aches and sharp pains down to my body being worn out.' She began suffering flu like symptoms and went to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, when the pain in her hip and back became so severe she could hardly move. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. It is is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America. Public Health England estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad. Ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas that feed on the blood of mammals, including humans. Tick bites often go unnoticed and the tick can remain feeding for several days before dropping off. The longer the tick is in place, the higher the risk of it passing on the infection. Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire. They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. Lyme disease can cause problems with a person's skin, joints, heart and nervous system. It is treated with antibiotics. Source: NHS Choices. She was treated for pressure sores with codeine and paracetemol, before being sent home with crutches. The pain became increasingly worse, but she didn't want to burden her family and so tried not to complain. She said: 'I tried to hide the pain from my kids as I didn't want to worry them, but it was getting harder to put on a brave face' 'I had to quit my job as a cleaner as I just couldn't work, I was in that much pain. 'It got so bad, my daughter called an out-of-hours doctor who visited me and gave me a morphine injection for the pain.' Just days later, Ms Dean woke to find she'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks. She could barely open her mouth to speak and found smiling or wrinkling her nose impossible. Her GP performed a series of reflex test and diagnosed Bell's Palsy \u2013 a rare condition that causes temporary weakness of the facial muscles. There is no known cure for the condition, although most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after a few weeks. But six months on, Ms Dean's face was showing few signs of improvement. 'I was horrified that my face was paralysed, but even more so when my doctor told me that there's no cure,' Ms Dean said. 'I was told I could be paralysed for weeks, or even months. Only time would tell.' Ms Dean, who is a single mother to Alexandra, 21, and Carl, 12, was referred to hospital. She underwent blood tests and a lumbar punctures, which is where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system.

{"abstract": "The cold air and stuck weather pattern in the East have resulted in historic lows for tornadoes so far this year. The Storm Prediction Center has only issued four tornado watches this year, compared to 52 by mid-March in previous years. While the development of El Nino may be a possible explanation for the recent drop in tornadoes, meteorologists caution that weather patterns can change quickly and even in years with low tornado counts, there can still be very violent tornadoes.", "article": "(CNN)While Boston and other New England cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons, other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions. All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East remains stuck in more of a winter mode. \"We're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather, and the right ingredients -- moisture, instability and lift -- (have yet to come together),\" said Greg Carbin, the Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather. So far this year it's been extremely quiet. By this time in mid-March the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide. This year they have issued a paltry four. Both January and February were well below normal. March has been even quieter.  At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado. \"We are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather\" Carbin said. In fact if we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first, according to the center. There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March. This year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the United States the past several years.  In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253. Meteorologists don't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes, but one possible answer is the development of El Nino, a warming in the equatorial Pacific, which can influence weather patterns globally. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said that a weak El Nino had developed. So while all agree this is good news so far this year, it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet. Weather patterns can change quickly. In 1984, for instance, there was a very similar slow start through mid-March and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of June, according to data from the storm center. It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example. The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record. The twisters in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma, occurred in May of that year with devastating results.

In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer. Southgate is still expected to do\u00a0everything\u00a0he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany\u00a0shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe. Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough. James Ward-Prowse. The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic. The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces. Germany's Julian Korb reaches out in vain as James Ward-Prowse fires home England's winning goal. The Under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance. In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game. Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on. Carl Jenkinson. Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home. But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side. Carl Jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for England as Germany substitute Nico Schulz looks on. Jenkinson put in a Man of the Match display having assisted two of England's three goals. It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal. With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team. Nathan Redmond. Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing. Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions. Nathan Redmond rifles home England's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner. Redmond celebrates after drawing England level late in the game following an impressive display on the right. It was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor Norwich side in the Premier League last season, but having struck the equaliser against a talented Germany team he looks to be improving. Now a veteran of the Under 21 set-up, it will be difficult for Southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for Kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the Young Lions.", "candidates": [["England won 3-2 against Germany in the European Under 21 Championship, with James Ward-Prowse scoring the winning goal and Carl Jenkinson assisting two of England's goals.

Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital. Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12. Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell. Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.' He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.' The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'. Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.' The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy. He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'. Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.' An inquest into the death of Paul (pictured bottom left and far right) and Jack was carried out today, where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing. Claire Throssell's son Jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother (pictured) at his bedside, but died five days later. He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss. Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.' CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week. Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.' She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.' Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father. The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had'meant the world' to her. 'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.' When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife. Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent \u00a3600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'.

But instead of walking her son to the local school like most parents, she is forced to drive 25 miles to Archie's current school in Kings Hill, Kent. Louise Beard claims she spends \u00a3100 per school day - \u00a32,000 a month - on the school run after son Archie, four, did not get a place at a local school. They are pictured with father Byron and little Poppy, aged two. This map shows the journey Mrs Beard does every day to ensure her son gets to his school 25 miles away. The accounts manager  then drops her two-year-old daughter Poppy at a nearby nursery, before parking at the closest train station and getting the train to work in south Bromley - just a few miles from her home. And at the end of the day, she has to do the entire journey in reverse, before picking them up from a childminder. She eventually gets the children home at around 8pm - 13 hours after they leave the house every morning. Mrs Beard said: 'It's awful at the moment. We are under a lot of stress. 'The kids are always sleeping in the car on the way. Archie is just exhausted.' The family estimate they spend around \u00a32,000 a month on the school run - or \u00a3100 per school day.

Total: Minimum spend of \u00a395 per day. Mrs Beard and recruitment manager husband Byron, 30, have already spent around \u00a312,000 on the school run since Archie started in September.

A spokesman for Bromley Council refused to comment on the case specifically. The spokesman said: 'Bromley Council is responsible for ensuring that children applying for a Bromley school are offered a school place. 'In common with the rest of London we have had exceptionally high demand for reception places and have worked hard to provide all parents who applied on time with an optimal school place. 'The high demand means that proximity to school criteria may have a small radius, particularly in a year with large numbers of siblings. 'The pan-London admissions scheme distributes places in a scrupulously fair and transparent way based on the eligibility criteria including the applicant's permanent address and the number of places available at each school.

{"abstract": "Exotic superfruits such as mangosteen, pitaya, gac, saw palmetto, lucuma, pichuberry, and aronia are said to have various health benefits ranging from healthy joints to reducing inflammation and improving cell function. These fruits contain high levels of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that can help protect cells from free radicals that cause ageing, degenerative diseases, and cancer. They can be purchased in various forms such as fresh, liquid, tea, capsules, and powder from health food stores and online retailers.", "article": "We all know we should be eating the recommended \u2018five a day\u2019 of fruit and veg. Now there\u2019s a host of exotic superfruits that are said to help reverse the skin\u2019s ageing process, boost energy levels and even fight disease. MANGOSTEEN. Native to South-East Asia, mangosteen is also known as the \u2018queen of fruit\u2019, because Queen Victoria offered a reward to anyone who could deliver some to her palace. Perhaps she\u2019d heard about its amazing health benefits, which range from healthy joints to improving the immune system. Mangosteen (pictured) is also known as the \u2018queen of fruit\u2019 and is native to South-East Asia. \u2018Mangosteen has been touted for its high content of xanthone compounds, which studies have shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties,\u2019 says Naomi Mead, lead nutritionist and founder of nutrition clinic Food First. Mangosteen is also good for acne, PMS and younger-looking skin. Buy your mangosteen in liquid form from Holland & Barrett (\u00a32.45) or Planet Organic (\u00a32.75), or order a bottle of capsules from biovea.com (\u00a317.20). PITAYA. More commonly known as dragon fruit, this is mild- tasting, but packs a powerful nutritional punch. Pitaya (pictured) is more commonly known as dragon fruit and although it's mild-tasting it has high nutritional values. \u2018Pitaya is rich in vitamin C, which has been repeatedly proven to protect against auto-immune diseases, heart problems and even the signs of ageing skin. It contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and improve cell function,\u2019 says Mead. Ocado stocks it in fresh (\u00a32.99) and tea (\u00a32.99) form. GAC. The spiky outer layer of this vine fruit might be poisonous, but the edible arils, or extra seeds, hidden inside are used across South-East Asia because of their fantastic red colour. Gac fruit (pictured) has a spikey outer layer which might be poisonous but the extra seeds inside are edible. The fruit contains huge amounts of beta-carotene and lycopene, known for their medicinal properties. \u2018Research has found the concentration of lycopene in gac to be around ten times higher than in tomatoes and carrots,\u2019 says Mead. \u2018Several studies, including research from the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at Portsmouth University, suggest lycopene helps protect against cancer of the lung, stomach and prostate.\u2019 Order gac, in powder form, for the princely sum of \u00a366.57 from Amazon. No one said every superfood comes cheap. SAW PALMETTO. The berries of this plant have been used in American Indian herbal medicine for hundreds of years \u2014 and for good reason. The fruit contains antioxidant compounds that can help in the treatment of an enlarged prostate gland or benign prostate hyperplasia. \u2018Clinical research has shown that taking one 320mg capsule of saw palmetto daily for two months before prostate surgery reduces blood loss, the development of problems during surgery and the total time spent in the hospital,\u2019 says Mead. Capsules available from Holland & Barrett (\u00a312.25) or Amazon (\u00a37.99). LUCUMA. \u2018Not only is it a good source of antioxidants, fibre, beta- carotene, niacin, potassium, zinc and iron, but the caramel taste makes it a healthy sugar alternative for diabetics and those avoiding refined sugar,\u2019 says Mead. Pick up this yellow Peruvian fruit at Planet Organic (\u00a36.99) or Whole Foods Market (\u00a37.42). PICHUBERRY. Another Peruvian export, this small berry  looks similar to a kumquat, but has a much higher vitamin content. Not only does it boast excellent levels of vitamin D, vital for healthy bones and skin, but it also contains vitamins C and B12. \u2018It has been shown to reduce inflammation as well as possessing anti-cancer properties,\u2019 says Mead. Pichuberry (pictured) is a Peruvian export and looks similar to a\u00a0kumquat but has a much higher vitamin content. Also known as Inca berries, green-fingered experts say they\u2019re hardy enough to be grown in Britain. Find them at biovea.net/uk (\u00a313.05) or suttons.co.uk (\u00a32.49 for seeds). ARONIA. All hail this North American berry, which has one of the highest antioxidant values recorded for a fruit.

But now the single mother-of-four who was rejected by American Idol three times, has revealed the baby she sang to in the video clip almost never existed after she considered an abortion. In a Facebook post, Henderson, who works as a full time nurse, explains that two years ago this week she had booked an appointment at an abortion clinic, but sat there for seven hours crying as she tried to make her decision. She then re-posted her post from that day, writing: 'I had my mind made up. My boyfriend was cheating on me. I have small kids, what will people think?? I kept telling myself I'm all alone I need to do this. Sitting there.. I could hardly make out anyone or anything through the tears. 'People were eating fast food around me, laughing, texting. I on the other hand was a wreck. I kept my face down, my face was drenched in tears. 'I kept telling and giving myself every reason to go through with this even though I did not believe in it. 'I kept saying I'm on birth control this could not happen.I kept trying to justify it. But my heart was heavy. I felt like I was about to make a horrible horrible decision. Henderson and three of her children. In a Facebook post, Henderson, who works as a full time nurse, explained that two years ago this week she had booked an appointment at an abortion clinic, but sat there for seven hours crying as she tried to make her decision. Henderson with her youngest daughter\u00a0Vaida Everly who she says she is 'in love with' 'My once tiny 6lb baby is now 18lbs. Full of life. Full of energy. Loves to laugh. Loves to smile,' she writes. She says she had a difficult morning getting to the clinic as she had to find a babysitter because her daughter was ill, her car broke down on the drive and she arrived for her appointment late - and then she began to wonder if 'God was giving me signs to not do it.' Henderson explains that when she was called for her appointment she was looking in her wallet for her ID when a card fell out out - it had been left on a table by a couple she had served that week and had their church name on it. She says a verse from the bible which was written on the card gave her strength and then two of her best friends called and said they would support her. She writes: 'I told the lady I changed my mind. As I was about to walk out. A young girl no older than probably 19 says to me..\"Are you going to do it?\" I told her I couldn't.. She said..\"I wish I could be brave like you..\" I told her she was brave and she could do the same thing. 'She said she had to do it because of some serious circumstances.. As I turned around she said..\"When you see your baby's face for the first time you're gonna be so glad you walked out of here today.\" She says that when she left the clinic she felt an 'enormous amount of relief and strength.' Henderson said she had a scary pregnancy and admits to suffering weak moments but gave birth in September 2013. 'I welcomed my beautiful Vaida Everly into this world with both my best friends by my side. I remember seeing her for the first time and bursting into tears,' she writes.

He did so out of respect. He did so because he recognises that a player who only joined this contest as a second-half substitute remains arguably the finest to have represented the club. But four minutes after the exchange of that iconic piece of elastic came a moment when Gerrard might have felt it appropriate to hand it back. Jordan Henderson scored a second-half winner for Liverpool as they continued their impressive recent form. Henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved Liverpool within two points of the Premier League's top four. A delighted Henderson let out a roar for the Liverpool fans in the Liberty Stadium. Henderson's shot was deflected over the top of Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski's head and into the back of the net. Henderson was mobbed by his team-mates after scoring what proved to be the winner in Wales.

It was then, 68 minutes into this contest, that Henderson did something that has long been synonymous with Gerrard: he came to Liverpool\u2019s rescue. If it lacked finesse, and owed more to good fortune, a winning goal that narrowed the gap to Manchester United in the fierce battle for Champions League places owed everything to Henderson\u2019s desire and determination. It was an ugly goal, Jordi Amat\u2019s attempted clearance spinning off Henderson\u2019s shin and flying beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski. But it was Henderson who made the run in pursuit of Daniel Sturridge\u2019s flick-on and Henderson, after a stuttering first half, who had given Liverpool impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break. The goal was Henderson's third in the last three Premier League games after his strikes against Manchester City and Burnley. Liverpool recorded their fifth successive Premier League victory ahead of their huge clash against Manchester United on Sunday. Henderson clattered into Shelvey with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but Roger East opted not to even book him. If Gerrard had an impact, it was his deployment as a holding midfielder that allowed Henderson to get forward. And the fact the goal came so soon after Gerrard\u2019s first appearance in eight games reflected well, once again, on Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers deserves enormous credit for the run of results Liverpool are enjoying. It is now 13 games unbeaten since they lost at Old Trafford in December and six away from home in the league without conceding a goal, an achievement that equals the club record set by Emlyn Hughes and Co in 1972. Rodgers has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side. It has been tactically astute leadership. But Rodgers also needed players to step out of Gerrard\u2019s shadow and prove they can survive without him. Nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in Henderson now reflecting on three goals in Liverpool\u2019s last three games. The pressure was on here with Sunday\u2019s game against United at Anfield and a trip to Arsenal to follow. And against a Swansea side displaying a find blend of ambition and graft under the guidance of Garry Monk, Liverpool struggled in that opening 45 minutes. Monk might have been the managerial apprentice but Rodgers would have recognised how well Swansea\u2019s players had mastered their boss\u2019s instructions. They were excellent, using the pace and power of Bafetimbi Gomis to good effect. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet makes a full-stretch save to deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal in the first half.

Farage claims that he was \"fobbed off by one NHS doctor to the next\" and that without private health insurance he would \"probably be dead\". Farage praised the NHS for emergency critical care but warned that the system is \"so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it\".", "article": "Ukip leader Nigel Farage said an Indian NHS doctor almost killed him by failing to diagnose his cancer. Nigel Farage has launched an astonishing attack on the National Health Service accusing doctors of 'incompetence and negligence' over their failure to diagnose his cancer. The controversial politician developed cancer in his 20s and said an Indian doctor tried to convince him he had an infection even though his left testicle had swollen to the size of a rock hard lemon. The Ukip leader claimed he was 'fobbed off by one NHS doctor to the next', and, without private health insurance, he would 'probably be dead'. Writing in his memoir, The Purple Revolution, which is being serialised in the Telegraph, Farage wrote: 'Several doctors examined me - registrars, locums, all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that I had a twisted testicle. I would need an immediate operation, they said. I was taken by ambulance to hospital in Farnborough, Hampshire, where I was re-examined by another four doctors. It was pretty painful. 'An Indian doctor told me that the Bromley doctors had got it all wrong: I had an infection. I was to go home and take a heavy dose of antibiotics. I did not need an operation after all. A few weeks went by and the pain was just as bad. All the time, my left testicle was getting markedly larger.' Mr Farage said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his 'left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard'. But despite being in a 'terrible state' a consultant directed him to ''keep taking the antibiotics' and sent him away. Eventually Mr Farage said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer. Scroll down for video. After being told he was covered by company health insurance he went for private treatment and was swiftly informed he had a tumour and would need to have a testicle removed. Mr Farage told how he was 'terrified' when doctors told him he may have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs. More than 30 years on, recounting the period'makes  me upset', he added. On the day of the 2010 general election, Mr Farage said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70-year-old.d. Mr Farage, pictured, revealed that one of his testicles had swollen up to the size of \u00a0large rock hard lemon. Mr Farage, pictured after a plane crash on election day in 2010 admitted the NHS was good in emergencies. After the air accident Mr Farage was told that he could be  signed off as partially  disabled but having a blue badge would be'conceding  defeat'.'I remember thinking,'so this is it, this is how it ends',' he said of the air crash. 'When people say that their life flashed before them when they thought they were about to die, it is rubbish. 'All I could think of was how much there was I still wanted to do and the impact my death would have on others - my girls were still so little and the boys were only just finding their way in the world.' He added:'Having nearly died three times has made me a much bigger risk-taker. When you think your life is about to be taken away and you are given it back, you just want to get on and do things. 'There's no time to waste: children to bring up, elections to win, pheasants to pluck, wine to drink.' The Ukip leader accused other political parties of being afraid of criticising the NHS. He has also taken the opportunity in his memoir to attack the other major Westminster political parties over their fear of criticising the NHS. He said that he is 'better qualified to criticise and defend our health care system than most politicians'. Mr Farage praised the NHS for being 'astonishingly good' at emergency critical care but claims the NHS will 'probably let you down' over screening and a fast diagnosis. He said the system is'so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it' and warned that the NHS'is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks'. 'There are huge problems with the NHS, deep structural ones, but, as I have said, I know more than most what that means on a personal level,' he wrote.

A credit union manager who told police he was held hostage, strapped with explosives and ordered to rob $4.2 million from the bank failed part of a lie detector test, it has emerged. Matthew Yussman, 46, had claimed two masked men ambushed him in his home in Bristol, Connecticut in the early hours of February 23 and held him and his mother captive. The next day, they ordered him to rob two Achieve Financial Credit Union branches, he said. He was ultimately found outside one of the banks with a device strapped to his chest, while his mother was discovered on her bed with another explosive beneath it. Both bombs turned out to be fake. Police previously said they had not determined if Yussman was a victim or a suspect but it has now emerged that he gave deceptive answers during a lie detector test the night of the attempted heist. He apparently lied while answering a question about his involvement in the home invasion, according to the Bristol Press, citing a search warrant for Yussman's home. New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said Yussman later withdrew from the test. 'He made the decision not to continue the interview a short time after,' Wardwell told the Press. The details emerged in search warrants secured this week for Yussman's home, car and laptop. Authorities previously took items, including his laptop and routers, and swabs from his home, and are investigating his cellphone and garbage bags taken from his car, among other items. The suspects reportedly ambushed Yussman in his garage as he returned home around 12.30am. Attempted heist: Police swarm around the Achieve Financial Credit Union in New Britain, Connecticut on February 23 after Yussman was found in the parking lot with a device strapped to his chest. Scare: Armored vehicles were seen on the scene before investigators learned the device would not go off. Yussman said two men stormed into his home that morning and took and his mother hostage. When his mother, who lives in an apartment on the side of the home, noticed he had failed to go inside, she checked on him and found him face-down with his hands zip-tied behind his back. Valerie Yussman, 70, told police that she saw the two 'well-spoken and polite' armed men in the garage and that they ordered her to stay on her bed. The men took Yussman from the home for 30 minutes around 3.30am after unplugging Mrs Yussman's phone, leaving her food and using duct tape to pin her to the bed. Her son told cops he was blindfolded and put in a car before they drove around for 30 minutes and returned to the house. It is not clear why they left the home. Valerie Yussman told police that she overheard the men saying they owed someone money and would kill the Yussmans unless they paid them. Her son and the men left later that morning after vacuuming a couple of rooms, she said. Around 8am, the bank's president called 911 and said Yussman had called him to explain his predicament, but told him not to call police. Minutes later, police found Yussman alone in his car outside the New Britain branch of the credit union and determined that the device on his chest was not going to detonate. Public works trucks were brought to the scene as'shields' because they would be large enough to withstand a blast or stop a car from fleeing if needed, Wardwell said. Probe: Yussman, the manager of a Achieve Financial Credit Union branch (pictured), remains under investigation and search warrants have been granted for his home, car and laptop this week. The suspects had disappeared by the time police arrived.\u00a0They are believed to have fled in a vehicle that looked like a white older model four-door Mazda, according to reports at the time. The incident sparked a massive police response involving dozens of officers and SWAT equipment. Schools were put on lockdown and roads were closed. Yussman was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where he was for exposure to freezing temperatures while having to sit in the unheated car. His mother was not hurt. The investigation is continuing. No arrests have yet been made but police previously said they were looking for two suspects.

This due to the\u00a0country's deteriorating security situation, as was witnessed on Friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country. A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings. What's more, hundreds of members of al Qaeda managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, the Houthis issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled President Hadi. Scroll down for videos. Yemenis and members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on Saturday in Yemen. Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on Saturday. CNN\u00a0reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among those who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and are now being sent out of the country. The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization\u00a0al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP, which is based in the country, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris. Members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of Friday's suicide bombings. Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The Houthis are a Shia group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup-d'etat that some believe was funded by Iran. In January of this year, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. It was at this point most Americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered. The Houthis also launched a strike against President Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital. That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi. This after President Hadi called the Houthis overtaking of the government 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy' in one of his first speeches in weeks. He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of\u00a0Riyadh, and no doubt upset the Houthis when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of\u00a0Sa'dah, the Houthi base. Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country. Hundreds of Yemenis chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings. Meanwhile, should ISIS indeed be behind Friday's attack, that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al Qaeda are both extremist Sunni groups, the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al Qaeda finding many ISIS acts and attacks far too extreme. Making ISIS's role in the bombings more likely is the January decree of al Qaeda senior leader Harith an-Nadhari who spoke against the shedding of 'unlawful blood,' such as attacks in mosques. The United States has said however they still cannot confirm who is behind the attacks.", "candidates": [["Around 100 Special Operations forces members have been evacuated from Yemen due to the deteriorating security situation.

Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset (pictured) last month.

One poll this week put the Lib Dems on just 5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, while Ukip were on 14 per cent.

It is significant because it suggests our first human ancestors emerged 400,000 years earlier than previously thought. The fossil is now encased in a glass box at the Arizona University. Scroll down for video. The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw (pictured), uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. The fossilised remains were put on display inside a glass case at Arizona University earlier this week. It was unveiled at a press conference by  Professor Kaye Reed, one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in January 2013. Scientists say the fossil, which is known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family. This would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - Homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Neanderthals. Researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve. 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon. 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge. 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early \u2018proto-human\u2019 shares traits with chimps and gorillas. 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's. 2.8 million years ago\u00a0- LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family. 2.7 million years ago\u00a0- Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing. 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa. 1.8 million years ago\u00a0- Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record. 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation. 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly. 400,000 years ago\u00a0- Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia. 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa. 40,0000 years ago\u00a0- Modern humans reach Europe. The discovery, which was found in the Ledi-Geraru area of Afar, has put a new date on the emergence of the first'man' from our more ape-like ancestors. Dr Brian Villmoare, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, helped lead the fossil hunters, said: 'In spite of a lot of searching, fossils on the Homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare. 'To have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage\u2019s evolution is particularly exciting. 'LD 350-1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million-year old Homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus. 'At 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved Homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features.' The researchers, whose work on the fossil is published in the journal Science, say the fossil could be a key missing link between the Homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called Australopithecus. Details of the Australopithecus are best known from a fossil named \u2018Lucy\u2019, dating back 3.2 million years, which was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. But exactly how Homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record. The new discovery has helped to fill that gap. Scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the Homo family from those belonging to Australopithecus. Until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils. Scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins. Dr William Kimbel, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University who was also involved in the research, said: 'The Ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between Australopithecus and early Homo. 'It\u2019s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution.'

Arsenal's players, pictured in training on Monday, are looking to overturn their 3-1 first leg defeat by Monaco. Chelsea 4-1 Napoli (Agg 5-4 after extra-time), Champions League last 16, March 14, 2012. Chelsea looked dead and buried after a dismal 3-1 defeat in Naples but, after the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas, the Blues stormed back to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Goals from Didier Drogba and John Terry had Roberto Di Matteo's men in control before Gokhan Inler's strike in the 55th minute put the visitors in charge. Frank Lampard levelled the tie with a 75th minute penalty and Branislav Ivanovic popped up in extra-time with a thumping finish to continue Chelsea's charge towards the trophy. Branislav Ivanovic celebrates after scoring the decisive goal in Chelsea's 4-1 win against Napoli in 2012. Fulham 4-1 Juventus (Agg 5-4), Europa League last 16, March 18, 2010. Fulham also suffered a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of this tie but the Cottagers didn't require extra-time to make it through to the last eight of the Europa League in style. David Trezeguet's goal appeared to have ended the contest early on but strikes from Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera - either side of a red card for Fabio Cannavaro - had Roy Hodgson's men back in it. Gera netted another from the penalty spot before Clint Dempsey sealed Fulham's progress with a delightful chip beyond the helpless Antonio Chimenti.

AC Milan could be forgiven for thinking this tie was as good as over after their 4-1 first leg win at the San Siro but Deportivo had other ideas. The Spanish side wiped out the visitors' advantage with first-half goals from Walter Pandiani, Juan Carlos Valeron and Albert Luque, putting themselves in the driving seat on away goals. The Serie A outfit had no answers and substitute Gonzalez Fran added a fourth goal 15 minutes from the end to seal Deportivo's place in the last four. Deportivo's players celebrate after scoring their third goal against AC Milan at the Riazor stadium in 2004. Monaco 3-1 Real Madrid (Agg 5-5), Champions League quarter-final, April 6, 2004. Fernando Morientes mocked Real Madrid's decision to send him out on loan as he dumped his parent club out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage. After scoring in a 4-2 first leg defeat at the Bernabeu, the Spaniard struck again after goals from Real striker Raul and team-mate Ludovic Guily. The Frenchman netted his second goal of the evening with a clever backheel to secure victory on away goals and set up a semi-final clash with Chelsea. Monaco captain Ludovic Giuly celebrates after  his side's 3-1 second leg win against Real Madrid. Bayern Munich 2-3 Inter Milan (Agg 3-3), Champions League last 16, March 15, 2011. After beating Bayern Munich in the Champions League final the season before, Inter Milan once again had the last laugh against the Bundesliga giants. Mario Gomez's late strike had given Louis van Gaal's men victory and an away goal in the first leg but Samuel Eto'o cancelled out Bayern's advantage after just three minutes. Gomez and Thomas Muller put the hosts 3-1 up on aggregate but a second-half goal from Wesley Sneijder and 88th minute winner from Goran Pandev sent Inter through on away goals. Goran Pandev (right), pictured having a shot, scored Inter Milan's winning goal against Bayern Munich late on. Middlesbrough 4-1 Basle (Agg 4-3), UEFA Cup semi-final, April 6, 2006. Middlesbrough made a habit of dramatic comebacks in their successful run to the UEFA Cup final in 2006 but this was perhaps the best.

The team is set to play Dynamo Kiev tonight in the first leg of their last-16 tie, and Naismith believes they have what it takes to challenge for the club's second continental honour. Despite the impact on the club's domestic performance, Everton has purposely picked strong sides to keep their run going in the Europa League.", "article": "It still clearly rankles with Steven Naismith that injury saw him miss out on a UEFA Cup final appearance with Rangers in what now seems like another dimension, never mind seven short years ago. But the Scotland star has revealed that it\u2019s the memory of that heartbreaking episode which is spurring him on to reach this season\u2019s Europa League showpiece with Everton. Roberto Martinez\u2019s men host Dynamo Kiev tonight at Goodison Park in the first leg of their last-16 tie and the hosts are expected to progress against one of the competition\u2019s lowest-ranked sides. Steven Naismith consoles Kevin Thompson after Rangers' defeat in the 2008 UEFA Cup final. Naismith is determined to make up for that defeat, and missing the final, with Everton this season. Britain\u2019s last remaining representatives in the tournament will have their work cut out to go all the way, with the likes of Wolfsburg, Napoli, Roma and Zenit also still in contention. But Naismith is adamant they have what it takes to challenge for the club\u2019s second continental honour after the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup was claimed three decades ago - and are ready to go one step better than Rangers did in 2008 when they lost to Zenit St Petersburg in Manchester. In his first campaign at Ibrox after leaving Kilmarnock, Naismith appeared as a sub in a crucial 1-1 draw at Panathinaikos that gave Walter Smith\u2019s side an away goals victory. He was also among the replacements at Werder Bremen and in both meetings with Sporting Lisbon as the Scots kept progressing. But four days before the first semi-final with Fiorentina, he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in a last-four Scottish Cup tie with St Johnstone. Naismith, and his then manager Walter Smith, walk past the trophy in 2008. The Everton forward (far left) trains with his team-mates ahead of their tie against Dinamo kiev. That ended Naismith\u2019s quest for European glory. He was a spectator at the final and didn\u2019t play again competitively for another nine months. \u2018I played in Greece back then and was on the bench a couple of times afterwards but then I got injured at Hampden,\u2019 recalled the 28-year-old. \u2018I missed the semi-finals and the final and I remember watching the penalty shoot-out in Florence that took us through on TV and I didn\u2019t feel 100 per cent part of it. It was a great feeling to see the team win but I hadn\u2019t travelled and it wasn\u2019 t great to feel I was missing out. \u2018This is an opportunity to make up for that. There was still a great buzz from sitting watching the final from the sidelines in Manchester. It was fantastic but it also makes me think now I\u2019d love to get that feeling again and hopefully go one better, play in the final and win it. That\u2019s what drives me on. \u2018It\u2019s not just that I never got to play back then but also that I want to experience the feeling we had around the club from getting to the final in the first place. 'This season when we\u2019ve been playing in Europe, it has crossed my mind that the experiences I had with Rangers can help me, especially at this stage in the tournament. The disappointment of seven years ago, and his failure to influence it, still haunts the Scotland striker. \u2018We had to be very resilient and well organised in 2008. Teams found it difficult to break us down and we did well to counter and create chances that way. 'We rode our luck a bit as well and I look at that and think it was great we got so far. It\u2019s something Everton can look to do now too and we\u2019ve been similar. \u2018In the group stage, things went flawlessly and we played every game perfectly. We were very solid in the last round against Young Boys as well. 'As things go on, we know it will get tougher and tougher but at this stage we feel we can go further and go as far as the final. We definitely believe that.\u2019 While many English sides have looked upon the Europa League as a distraction from domestic matters in recent seasons, that hasn\u2019t been the case at Everton. Martinez has purposely picked strong sides to keep his team\u2019s run going, rather than sacrifice participation in the competition for the sake of concentrating more on the Premier League. Naismith wants to get his hands on the trophy he came so close to with his former club Rangers. That has impacted on the club\u2019s domestic performance and they lie 14th in the top flight - but hopes remain high they can strike a balance on both fronts.

Rohit was caught in the deep when he was on 90 but was allowed to keep batting when the umpires ruled that Rubel Hossain's delivery was above waist-height and therefore a no-ball, although television replays suggested it was a fair delivery. Rohit had initially been forced to abandon his normal cavalier approach as his team mates struggled to score quickly on a windy afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground but exploded later in the innings. While Suresh Raina (65) was the only other batsman to make a significant contribution at a rapid strike-rate, Rohit batted for 47 overs to make 137 off 126 balls, highlighted by 14 boundaries and three sixes. For a man who scored a world record 264 last year, it was almost sluggish going by his normal standards but no less crucial in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the World Cup. Of the three matches already played at the sprawling MCG during this tournament, the team batting first has scored over 300 runs and won each time and Bangladesh now face a formidable challenge to break that sequence. The MCG can be an intimidating bear-pit of a stadium and India opted to bat first in front of their fanatical supporters, and got off to a flying start, racing past 50 inside the first 10 overs. Bangladesh, appearing in their first World Cup quarter-final, managed to put the brakes on India's scoring after the fielding restrictions were lifted and they brought on their spinners. From the end of the 10th over till the start of the 35th over, India added just 104 runs for the loss of three wickets. Rohit Sharma hits through the onside on his way to a century for India against Bangladesh. Sharma celebrates as he reaches his hundred in India's the World Cup quarter final at the MCG. Rohit Sharma is congratulated for his milestone by Suresh Raina (left), who second top scored with 65. Rohit's innings ended on 137 from 126 balls when he was bowled by Bangladeshi quick Taskin Ahmed. Shikhar Dhawan was the first Indian batsman to go, stumped for 30, and he was quickly followed by Virat Kohli, who was caught behind for three after a reckless slash at a wide delivery. When Ajinkya Rahane departed for 19 in the 28th over, the world champions were suddenly looking under pressure and Bangladesh the team with all the momentum. But cricket is a game where things can turn on the smallest of margins and India got two big breaks that proved decisive. Raina survived a confident appeal for lbw when he was on 10 then Rohit got a massive let-off 10 runs short of his century when he holed out at mid-wicket. The pair put on 122 for the fourth wicket as Bangladesh began to lose their way in the field. Raina threw his wicket away in the 44th over when he skied a catch behind then Rohit joined him after he was bowled by Taskin Ahmed but their efforts left India in a strong position to join South Africa as the second team in the semi-finals.

But Hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders. Dry booze: A brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

The approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy. Several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol, including lawmakers in Colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale. That bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval. Concerns have included abuse by minors, the potential to snort the powder and whether Palcohol's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks. Palcohol would come in a pouch, with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink. A statement on Palcohol's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer. Palcohol founder Mark Phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early Wednesday morning, and said in a subsequent email that pricing hasn't yet been determined. 'We aren't commenting on production or distribution at this time,' he wrote. The four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan, a margarita, vodka and rum. Phillips added that he expects another Palcohol product \u2014 Lemon Drop \u2014 should also be 'approved shortly.' Previously, Phillips had said he came up with the idea for Palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles. Hogue said the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regularly reaches out to the Food and Drug Administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered 'adulterated.' If the FDA says the product isn't adulterated, he said the bureau's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what's in the product.

Forensic staffers and policemen stand at the site where three models were shot dead in the Valle de Angeles municipality in Tegucigalpa. Models Madelyn Ramirez Zambrano (left) and\u00a0Blanca Velasquez Alejandra Mejia (right) were both killed by gunmen in Honduras. Alma Mariela Vargas was killed in a cold-blooded execution with two other models on Sunday morning. They were forced out and executed in cold blood, police said. A man and another woman in their party were injured in the shootout and taken to Escuela Hospital for treatment. Police found 15 bullet casings at the scene, according to Laprensa.hn. An official said that one of the gunmen asked for one of the models by name before the murders took place. She was shot first before the other two were killed, he said. The tragedy followed the arrest in Honduras of Jose Miguel \"Chepe\" Handal, the alleged leader of a drug trafficking organization that coordinated the shipment of tons of Colombian cocaine via Mexican cartels to the United States. Handal, a prominent Honduran businessman, was taken into custody without a struggle in the northwestern city of San Pedro Sula on Thursday near a hospital where his father was receiving treatment, President Juan Orlando Hernandez said in a television interview. Police found 15 bullet casings at the scene, according to a Honduran newspaper report. Hernandez said Honduran judges would likely be in charge of the case because there has not yet been an extradition request from the United States. Since 2013, the U.S. government has identified Handal as a drug trafficking kingpin who supplied Colombian cocaine to Mexico's Sinaloa and rival Los Zetas cartels using clandestine airstrips as well as land-based routes into Guatemala, where the Mexican gangs have a presence. Handal's father and his wife were also designated as leaders of the organization by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"After several months of searching, today Chepe Handal has been detained and will now be judged,\" Hernandez said in a post on his Twitter page.

The world champion was replying to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who called on the FIA to limit the superiority of Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes team to make the season a more even fight. Horner\u2019s view was supported on Monday by Bernie Ecclestone, the sport\u2019s commercial boss, who said: \u2018Red Bull are 100 per cent right. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian Grand Prix win after he finished ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg. The British Formula One star appeared in good spirits as he was pictured at Sydney Airport on Monday. \u2018There is a rule I think (former FIA president) Max Mosley put in that in the event of a particular team or engine supplier doing something magic, which Mercedes have done, the FIA can level up things. Mercedes have done a first-class job. We need to change things a little bit now. \u2018What we should have done was frozen the Mercedes engine and leave everybody else to do what they want so they could have caught up. We should support the FIA to make changes.\u2019 The indications  were that the FIA, the sport\u2019s rule-makers, will not rush to act on Ecclestone\u2019s words, which may have been intended primarily to soothe Red Bull, whose motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said they might walk away in light of rules that \u2018will kill the sport\u2019. Hamilton, celebrating his 34th career victory in Melbourne, detected an irony in Red Bull\u2019s criticism. Also on the podium was Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel who, as a Red Bull driver, won four consecutive championships from 2010. On Sunday it was third-placed Vettel\u2019s turn to finish more than half a minute behind Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

So I know how it must have felt back then.\u201d \u2018He had nobody behind pushing him. At least I\u2019ve got my team-mate, who I was really racing. I don\u2019t remember that ever being the case with Red Bull.\u2019 Ouch, even though Mark Webber did sometimes push Vettel, and not all of the German\u2019s championships were comfortable, with his first title coming down to a four-way decider in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton added: \u2018If you want to put someone in the same car, there is no doubt where I would be finishing. People say it\u2019s all the car. Well, it\u2019s a big team that built this car. I\u2019m the one who has to get in and extract the best from it. There has never been a driver that has won the championship that hasn\u2019t had a great car that year.

Kristopher Dohm was booked into Paso County jail (mugshot left) after he was found with the children in a hotel room. They were staying with\u00a0Edward Tarras Jr - who is facing nearly a dozen sex-related charges in Tennessee - including sexual exploitation of a minor. Distraught: Ms Hughes Dohm had released a heart-wrenching video (pictured) begging for the return of her  sons, whom she thought may have had their appearances altered by her former husband. Tarras missed a court date in August and police in Tennessee said at the time that he cut off an ankle monitor and fled town, investigators said. He was then listed as one of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's most wanted fugitives. He was tracked down after his cellphone was traced to Florida by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Marshals service, according to Sgt. Bobby Gibson with the Smyrna police department in Tennessee. He said the two were friends from growing up together in New Jersey. Prosecutors previously said Tarras had lured teen girls through an Internet ad seeking models to photograph. Tarras was appointed a public defender Thursday and was ordered held without bond in his first court appearance. Both men were jailed at the Pasco County Central Detention Center. Dohm also was being held without bond. Dohm's sons were reported missing by their mother February 9 after she said they weren't returned home by their father in violation of a custody agreement. According to\u00a0NJ.com, Kristopher had been planning the abduction for some time. Sandra  reported Parker and Jackson missing on February 9 after her former husband failed to return them to her New Jersey home. 'Abducted': In her video, posted on YouTube, Ms Hughes Dohm told her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. You should not have taken them from me... they need their mother.' Above, the two boys. Together: Addressing her sons, she added: 'Parker and Jackson, I love you dearly. If you can pick up a phone and call me, or call the police, or tell somebody, ask for help. I'm looking for you every day, every night' The boys had been scheduled to stay with their father for a week under a custody agreement that was made during the couple's 2012 divorce, but Kristopher had been required to bring them home that Sunday night. Instead however, he abducted Parker, who has asthma, and Jaxon and drove out of the state in his 2009 grey Nissan Pathfinder, swapping out his license plate with stolen plates along the way to avoid detection. Sandra released a heart-wrenching video begging for the return of her two sons earlier this week, noting that they may have had their appearances altered by Dohm, who suffers from diabetes. In the footage, posted on YouTube, the distraught mother, who shares custody of the boys with Dohm, tells her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. They need their mother.'

'We've been going through pictures and he's just smiling in every picture. He was just a happy, go-lucky kid.' The fire started in a recreation room at the rear of the house. The official cause was faulty wiring, according to the complaint. The parents had fallen asleep watching television, but were woken by the smoke alarm and managed to get out of the building via a rear door in the same room. They then called 911. Wreck: A city police officer fired his stun gun at Ryan Miller as he tried to re-enter his burning home, which was destroyed. Riley was asleep in his bedroom and so Ryan Miller ran to the front of the house and kicked in the front door. Police arrived as he was about to enter and an officer stunned him with a Taser. State Fire Marshal Investigator Scott. Stoneberger said that a firefighter in full gear attempted to enter the. home but the flames were too hot.

An 1891 oil painting - titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' - has been proven to be one of Claude Monet's despite the artist painting over his own signature. The painting has been owned by the\u00a0G\u00f6sta Serlachius Fine Arts Foundation, also in Finland, for more than 50 years. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season. The painting was verified after a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature by  Monet. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet (above) with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season. Ilkka P\u00f6l\u00f6nen, a researcher, said the camera scans one 'line' at a time. He told ArtDaily: 'When the camera is moved using the scanner an image of the whole picture can be obtained.' The Fine Arts Foundation said the artwork  is the first Monet painting to be held in a Finnish public collection. The other paintings from the series are held at various galleries including the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Scotland and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a non-destructive technique, which can identify the presence of certain pigments. It was first used in the 1940s and applied to paintings in the 1950s. The technique involves bombarding the artwork with x-rays so powerful that they cause atoms in the picture\u2019s layers to emit \u2018florescent\u2019 x-rays of their own. XRF can be used to identify the colours of hidden paintings or to see earlier versions of famous pieces.\u00a0By mapping the x-rays of copper, for blue and green, iron, for yellow, orange and brown, and mercury, for red, scientists can see full-colour'maps' of previous versions.

The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray.", "article": "(CNN)The man who attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of Molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders, authorities said. The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport.

Chai Jing's investigative documentary - which has already attracted unprecedented attention from the country's officials - explores the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells the story of her daughter, who was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The 39-year-old goes on to report how a number of newborn babies in China have contracted pneumonia without even leaving home. Scroll down for video. Young victims: Chai Jing, 39, has made a hard-hitting film, exploring the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. Motherly love: In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells how her daughter was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The film also features an interview with Wang Huiqin (pictured), 6, who lives in highly industrialised Shanxi Province and says she has never seen stars or blue skies. Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. It has already been watched by some 200million people and has sparked a firestorm of public criticism over the government's failure to act on the issue in a timely manner. In the 144-minute film, Ms Chai, a former anchor at China Central Television, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, tells how she made the documentary to tell her daughter 'what is smog, where smog comes from and what we shall do with it'. She explains how she found herself pregnant in January 2013, when 25 provinces and cities in China were blanketed by heavy smog. She then gave birth in October 2013, when her daughter had already been diagnosed with a benign tumour. The diagnosis led to Ms Chai quitting her job  at the beginning of last year so she could focus on taking care of her daughter. It was during that period that she began making the film, entitled Under the Dome, she explains. Enveloped: Most cities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai (pictured), face serious air pollution issues. Price for industrialisation: China burns a large amount of\u00a0petroleum and coal, two major causes of pollution. The film was distributed to various video websites in China on February 28. It received 117 million views in the first 24 hours, according to\u00a0Tencent. Ms Chai's daughter is no longer unwell. But she says in the film that she only took her daughter outside when air quality in Beijing was marked excellent or good. The rest of the time she had to lock her daughter at home 'like a prisoner', she claims. She adds that 175 days during 2014 were graded as polluted in Beijing. The film also includes an interview with a six-year-old girl, Wang Huiqin, who lives in Shanxi Province, a heavily industrialised area in central China. The girl tells Ms Chai in the interview how she has never seen stars, blue skies or white clouds in her life. Stardom: Ms Chai is a highly recognised anchor and investigative journalist in China. She is also a best-selling writer. Controversy: Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. China's cities are often hit by heavy pollution \u2013 in the form of smog \u2013 caused by burning a large amount of petroleum and coal. The film has already been widely backed by the Chinese public, as well as a number of officials. Chen Jining, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection in China, was quoted in an article on People's Daily\u00a0as saying:\u00a0'I want to thank her. She has wakened up the public to pay attention to the environment from a public health perspective. 'I think (she is) worth our respect.' Self-protection: A girl puts a mask on her dog in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province, during a smog attack. Fake sunrise: An LED screen on the Tiananmen Square shows what a sun-rise looks like in heavily polluted Beijing. And Gao Mingyong, a senior media commentator in China, wrote on ifeng.com: 'Under the Dome is the best example of self-initiated media which can represent the logic of the internet, but its significance is far more than this.' Ms Chai financed the making of the film by herself which cost $160,000. It's believed that Ms Chai gave birth to her daughter in the U.S, leading to her being branded a hypocrite and traitor", "candidates": [["A film made by Chai Jing, a former state TV news anchor, has sparked public criticism in China after linking her baby's tumour to the country's terrible air pollution.

Gregg Peers, who is standing for the Conservatives in a Cumbria County Council by election two weeks before the general election, posted the fancy dress picture on his Facebook page. Mr Peers has previously stood for election in Newcastle and is the agent to the Tory parliamentary candidate for Barrow and Furness Simon Fell. A Conservative Party spokesman this afternoon attacked Mr Peers' fancy dress choice. He said: 'This is unacceptable and in poor taste. The candidate has apologised and taken the picture down.' But Labour shadow minister Liz Kendall said the Conservative Party needed to immediately discipline the candidate. She said: 'Oscar Pistorious is rightly serving time in prison for killing Reeva Steenkamp - it is stomach churning to see a man who wants to hold elected office making a joke out of the death of a woman. 'David Cameron must show he takes violence against women seriously by taking immediate action against his candidate, and the Conservatives must explain why they promoted him to senior positions in their party.' Oscar Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction. Former Olympian sprinter Oscar Pistorius posing with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2013 just a month before he shot and killed her. Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction. Prosecutors in South Africa want Pistorius convicted of murder for shooting his girlfriend multiple times in a bathroom in his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. Labour shadow minister Liz Kendal said David Cameron should sack Mr Peers. In December, Judge Thokozile Masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit Pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius's lawyers had argued that the judge should not have allowed that appeal. The Olympian and multiple Paralympic champion is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide, or negligent killing. The 28-year-old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital, Pretoria, in August to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. If prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the Supreme Court of Appeal and have it upgraded to murder, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail. Judge Masipa, who presided over Pistorius's seven-month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors, made her latest ruling after a short court session in Johannesburg. Pistorius's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits in the central city of Bloemfontein. No date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court, legal experts have said.", "candidates": [["David Cameron is being criticised by Labour MPs for not taking violence against women seriously after a Tory candidate dressed up as the convicted killer Oscar Pistorius.

{"abstract": "Egg consumption in the UK rose by 2.4% in 2014, equivalent to an extra 700,000 eggs per day, as the foodstuff becomes increasingly popular as part of protein-rich diets such as Atkins and Paleo. The rise in popularity is a remarkable resurgence for the egg, which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s. The egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13% to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit.", "article": "After decades in the doldrums, eggs appear to have a cracking future. Consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled, scrambled and fried every day of the week. It is a remarkable resurgence for the egg, which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to \u2018Go to work on an egg\u2019. The revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein-rich diets such at Atkins and Paleo, which promise weight loss and even a longer life. Consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day. Experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein-rich diets including Atkins and Paleo. As a result, egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former Tory health minister Edwina Currie infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination. That attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs, which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol, which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries. However, the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit. At the same time, Vitamin D, which is vital for healthy bones, is up by 64 per cent compared to a decade ago. The net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body. Until 2009, Britons were warned against eating more than three eggs a week because of the worries about cholesterol \u2013 but this warning has now been junked. Research by experts at University of Surrey found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels. If you are looking for a loan, serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick. A compound found in eggs makes people much more generous, new research suggests. Scientists say that tryptophan, an amino acid found in some foods, can change our behaviour. In experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity. Eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel-good chemical serotonin. And the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines. It stated: \u2018Cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.\u2019 A spokesman for the British Egg Information Service said: \u2018Health professionals\u2019 recognition of their health benefits, and the end of the confusion over their effect on cholesterol, mean eggs are now being widely recommended as part of a healthy diet. \u2018They are also included in all major slimming plans, from established groups such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World, to more recent trends such as the Atkins and Paleo diets.\u2019 Egg consumption has also been boosted by the trend to eat breakfast at dinner under the rise of the \u2018Brinner\u2019 \u2013 a trend that has been imported from America. In total, 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year. \u2018Consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014, having grown 16 per cent in the past five years,\u2019 said the spokesman, adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s. The details were reported by Farmers Weekly, which said sales have also been helped by supermarket promotions and price cuts. Data obtained from retail analyst Kantar Worldpanel shows that, in the 52 weeks to the end of February, the GB retail market for eggs was up 2.4 per cent in volume terms. The egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit. However, the supermarket price cuts meant the actual value of these sales fell by a significant 4.8 per cent to \u00a3768m. Andrew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council, said he anticipated another year of rising consumption in 2015, pointing to the sector\u2019s first TV advertising in 10 years, as well as a new Main Meals in Minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity Lucy Mecklenburgh.

Scroll down for videos. Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old. Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to a journal that he was now writing in prison and that the reasons for his horrific actions that he details in it could only be explained by a psychiatrist. 'What I'm looking for is the real reason why I took that road and what drove me to that, because in Australia I wasn't like that,' he said. However, for every direct question Ms Brown had, Scully had an equally opaque answer. 'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage. Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he said that he did, but could not say exactly when he felt this. 'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done,' he said. \u2018At what point do you have remorse? I can't answer that honestly yet.' When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Ms Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house. 'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown. 60 Minutes Tara Brown went behind bars in the Phillipines to speak to the alleged paedeophile. Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 13 children and causing the death of another. Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including\u00a0Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie. She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task.

Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland. North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England. But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point \u2013 football. This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win? In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East. And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event? Yesterday, Rob Draper selected his South XI. Here, Joe Bernstein reveals his North XI - plus seven subs. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager. And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... Goalkeeper: Joe Hart (Manchester City) Tough call between David de Gea and Hart, but the City stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air. And, as he showed against Lionel Messi, he can stop a penalty too. Right back: Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle United) Been outstanding this season and Toon fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up. Janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard. Creative player too. Centre half: Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City) Would surely have been an England regular if he played for a more glamorous club than Stoke. Better than Gary Cahill or Phil Jagielka, less injury-prone than Phil Jones. This team is so crammed with attacking talent, the two centre-halves are in purely to defend. And they're good at that. Joe Hart has been superb in the league and showed against Barcelona he can do it in Europe too. Daryl Janmaat has been outstanding this season and Newcastle fans will have an anxious wait this summer. Ryan Shawcross pictured scoring for Stoke City against Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium. Centre half: Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) Totally fearless, he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre-half. Useful in both penalty areas at set-pieces too, he gets his fair share of goals for a defender. Him and Shawcross wouldn't let anything pass, allowing the two full backs to push up. Left back: Leighton Baines (Everton) Just gets better and better with age. Fantastic at set-pieces, both delivery and shooting, and so calm on the ball. Has got over the disappointment of not joining Manchester United and it's no coincidence Everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured. Right wing: Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Showed at the last World Cup he has now taken over Wayne Rooney's mantle as the best player in the England team and it's hard to believe he is still only 20. The one player in Roy Hodgson's squad that you think could actually make it with Real Madrid or Barcelona, he is quick, skilful, has natural balance and courage on and off the ball. Liverpool's totally fearless defender Martin Skrtel (right) squares up to David de Gea at Anfield recently. Everton's Leighton Baines just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding Premier League. Raheem Sterling has become an brilliant performer for Liverpool this season as they look to tie him down. Central midfield: Michael Carrick (Manchester United) People ask why Manchester United's form has improved in the last couple of matches. Simple, Michael Carrick is back from injury and making the team tick. Always seems to know when to play the right pass, and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great. Central midfield: James McCarthy (Everton) If this team has steel down the middle in Skrtel and Shawcross, and stealth in Carrick, McCarthy adds speed. He can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball, the Irishman is neat and tidy. One of Roberto Martinez's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him. Left midfield: David Silva (Manchester City) With Leighton Baines behind him, Silva wouldn't have to hug", "candidates": [["The Premier League has been divided into teams from the north and south of England, with Welsh side Swansea included in the south.

House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration.

When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no.

Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems. While the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough. Using up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against. The strategy has been pretty straightforward. Each time that President Obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation, whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality, Republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy. This is what Republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if Democrats did not accede to their budget demands. Congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default. This was all that anyone in Washington was talking about. The GOP did the same with the threat of a government shutdown. Even though the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act is remote, Republicans keep bringing it up for a debate, forcing Democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing. The \"tea party\" faction of the House Republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week. Since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles, and that they won't allow Boehner to rein them in for \"practical\" political considerations, Democrats can't afford to take the threats lightly. Republican leaders can and have said to the White House they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems, but with a nod to the Republican caucus, remind Obama that they don't have full control. While it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the GOP and place Republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016, many congressional Republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar. Aside from vetoing bills, President Obama doesn't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away. Now the GOP has done it again. Even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security, months have been consumed on Capitol Hill. When the year began President Obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year. He wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor, as well as the struggles facing middle class Americans. But he has only had limited success. Instead, he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill. When House Republicans pushed their \"stop-gap\" measure to fund Homeland Security for just another week, they were following the standard game plan. By avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems, and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time, the GOP continues to eat away at the president's political clock. Usually political extremism does not have the virtues that Sen. Barry Goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the Republican Convention, but it sure can have short-term political benefits in Congress. Just ask Mitch McConnell, who can barely contain his grin.", "candidates": [["Congressional Republicans in Congress have defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration.

But chances are he'll feel right at home. From television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock Tudor housing developments, China has been embracing British culture with a passion. Chinese viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like \"Sherlock Holmes\" and \"Downton Abbey,\" with the former's star, Benedict Cumberbatch, so popular he has his own Chinese nickname -- Curly Blessing. The fascination with Edwardian England depicted in Downton has created a growing demand for butlers, and the country's elite are donning tweeds and taking up deer stalking. \"Downton Abbey depicts traditional British, high-class lives. It something that I and many other Chinese are curious about,\" said student Cherrie Zhang. It's not just television shows. Affluent Chinese parents are sending their children to British schools after some of the most notable names in British education have established campuses in China. Harrow, Wellington College and Dulwich College have all opened sister schools in the country. And the obsession with British culture has taken a bizarre turn in Thames Town, a housing development on the outskirts of Shanghai that resembles a quaint English town, complete with replica red telephone booths. It's crucial that Prince William capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high-profile visit, which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills. \"It will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne,\" said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney and a former British diplomat. \"And I think China will put some capital in his visit because this guy is not a politician, who come and go, but (someone who) will be around for quite a while.\" Cultural exports are viewed as a growth area that the prince can promote. China spent 17 million pounds on UK TV programs and formats in 2013, a 40% increase on the year before, but they form a small part of the overall trade balance. And while London has been successful in attracting Chinese investment, UK companies have not thrived in China the same way as some of their U.S. and German counterparts. Previous trips by Royals have been gaffe ridden. When the Queen and Prince Philip spent time in China in 1986, the Queen's husband caused offense when he told a group of British students: \"If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed.\" Prince Charles, William's father, has never visited China but described the country's leaders as \"appalling old waxworks\" during his visit to Hong Kong in 1997. His close ties with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, have also angered China's leaders. Prince William will visit Beijing's Forbidden City, attend the Chinese premiere of the British-produced children's animated movie \"Paddington\" in Shanghai and launch a campaign to celebrate British innovation during the three-day trip. Before China, he is spending three days in Japan. The prince will also get a chance to champion one of his favorite causes -- combating the illegal trade in wildlife --  when he visits an elephant sanctuary in southwestern China. \"If he can make some kind of link in China, if he can instinctively show he gets it, that could be an important thing,\" Brown said. But the relationship between the UK and China comes laden with \"stacks of historic baggage,\" Brown adds, and the prince will have to tread carefully, particularly over the former colony of Hong Kong, where the push for a free vote has strained ties between Britain and China, the current landlords. British lawmakers were denied permission to visit the city on a \"fact-finding\" mission last year amid heated pro-democracy protests. What's more, it's not clear how much \"star power\" Prince William has in China, especially without his glamorous wife Kate, who at eight months pregnant won't make the trip, and his young son George. An informal survey conducted by the UK's Telegraph newspaper in Beijing showed that many struggled to recognize the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- one thought the couple were in the movie \"Titanic\" -- and there are fears his visit will struggle to attract interest among ordinary Chinese. \"The Royal Family are not really a big deal to me,\" said Zhang, the Downton Abbey fan. Serena Dong in Beijing contributed to this report.", "candidates": [["Prince William is set to visit China for the first time in three decades, and his visit is being viewed as a test of his diplomatic skills.

Only seven others could ever make that claim: Fangio, Brabham, Piquet, Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Vettel. Here in sunlit Melbourne, Hamilton began practice for the Australian Grand Prix at the start of a 20-round season in which the British driver hopes to add his name to that exclusive club. Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to retain the Formula One title after last season's triumph. Hamilton took part in Friday's Formula One Grand Prix practice session ahead of Sunday's season opener.

The saying in F1 is those that start with \u2018M\u2019 are the best to be at: Melbourne (my absolute favourite), Monte Carlo, Montreal and Monza. Mexico returns this year. Hamilton pondered the word \u2018legend\u2019 and said: \u2018I hope when I have retired and am much, much older, perhaps in 30 years, a kid might use that phrase for me. \u2018I want to win this year. There\u2019s a championship there for the taking. Damn it, I want to win it! I want to go and grab it. More than ever. At least as much as last year, and hopefully even more.\u2019 He will certainly have a car capable of accomplishing that task. Mercedes are in a parallel universe of speed and reliability, according to pre-season testing. It again promises to be a straight fight between him and his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lauda is their boss at Mercedes. Stewart has been a critic of Hamilton from time to time. He thinks the word \u2018legend\u2019 can only be applied long after a driver has hung up his helmet. \u2018That is how it works with many halls of fame in America,\u2019 he said. \u2018Time waits to confer its judgment.\u2019 The debate about Hamilton is always keen. He fuels this by his actions. He has taken to posting pictures of himself brooding and pouting, half-dressed and self-absorbed on the photo-based website Instagram. One such picture had Hamilton standing in a graffiti-lined alley in Melbourne looking up to the sky with his hands clasped in prayer. These fine exhibits of modern art are being undertaken by Dan \u2018Spinz\u2019 Forrest, a bald and bearded music producer who seems newly to have attached himself to Hamilton. He is walking around the paddock with a camera in his hand. Never mind that, it is Hamilton\u2019s heavy and skilled right foot that will define him over the next eight-and-a-half months.

In qualifying, he seemed weaker than ever. It was a different Lewis. This year, with more confidence, he\u2019ll be more consistent in qualifying and a stronger driver.\u2019 Rosberg\u2019s qualities should not be enough to stop an on-form, all-firing Hamilton becoming the first Briton to win consecutive titles, but the German is calm and focused on his retaliative challenge. \u2018Lewis was a little bit stronger than me last year,\u2019 admitted Rosberg, who is due to become a father in August. \u2018He\u2019s been working on himself during the winter and I have been working on myself. \u2018I\u2019m not at my peak Formula One performance yet.

Five of the dogs live at Old Havana's Museum of Metalwork and regularly patrol the streets after hours. When not patrolling, each of the dogs can be found sleeping underneath the institution's grand stairway. Vladimir the former street dog now lives at the Old Havana Museum of Metalwork in Havana, Cuba. Each of the street dogs is given an official identity badge with its photograph and contact details. Security Guards Dary Valdes, left, and Margarita Garcia, right, enjoy looking after their unusual colleagues. The dogs, Vladimir, Canela, Aparicio, Leon and Carinoso spend the days avoiding the hot Caribbean sun among the museum's artworks. All of the dogs afforded the special status are immune from the attentions of Havana's dog catcher. Yarisbel Perez, who works in one of the historic buildings in Plaza Vieja, in the centre of the old city, said: 'I don't like dogs but I've really developed a soft spot in my heart for them.' Ms Perez and her colleagues are responsible for two dogs, Nina and P9, who is named after a bus line in the city. Ms Perez feed her dogs half-eaten pork chips and left-over chicken and rice from a nearby restaurant. Ordinarily, all animals are banned from workplaces in Cuba with the exemption of guard dogs. Nora Garcia, President of the Cuban Association for the Protection of Plants and Animals said the dogs were afforded their special status after a guard was awoken one night by a barking dog who noticed some people were looking to steal an air conditioning unit. Guard Yarisbel Perez said she did not initially like the dogs but has since developed a soft spot for them. The dogs are afforded special protection from Havana's dog catcher because of their security role. Leon, Canela, Vladimir and Aparicio pictured are four of the five dogs at the metalwoork museum. Ms Garcia said: 'There was a public ceremony in which the dog received an award for saving the air conditioners.' Some security guards adopt the dogs to alleviate the boredom of protecting buildings in a city with little crime. Victoria Pacheco, who works in the metalwork museum said: 'They don't eat bones. They eat cold cuts, mincemeat, hotdogs and liver.' The animal protection society maintains a list of 21 dogs living in state institutions, including a Communist Party gas station, offices of the Cuban Journalists' Union and a mechanical workshop of the Ministry of Public Health.

They don't bark and they don't bite anyone.' Each of the dogs is provided with free healthcare and accommodation by the state institutions invovled. Dogs without the special name tag face being detained by the dog catcher and possibly destroyed. Other dogs haven't been so lucky, including a group snatched by the dogcatcher from Havana's University of Arts while their student protectors were home on vacation, Garcia said.

{"abstract": "The All England Lawn Tennis Club has apologized for using the iconic Athena Tennis Girl poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum. The poster, which was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, was criticized on social media for being sexist and not reflecting the history of tennis. Despite the apology, the poster will remain in the exhibition, which will showcase tennis posters dating back to 1893.", "article": "Saucy: The Athena poster that led to the apology. It's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Whether Athena's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum is another matter entirely. Following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media, the All England Lawn Tennis Club was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition. Earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket, alongside the famous image, to promote its Powerful Posters exhibition, due to open tomorrow. That such a saucy shot should appear to have won the approval of the historic and respectable club immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma was outraged, writing: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who call themselves 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The offending image was swiftly deleted from the official Wimbledon Twitter account and a new post went up which said: 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it.' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition. However, a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Last night an All England Club spokesman said the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over 2million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. One Twitter user said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for \u2013 I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.'

Republican C.J.Pearson found out the price of his new found fame on Friday morning when a friend told him it had been deactivated for'suspicious activity'. Fearing his video, which was watched by more than 1.4 million people, may have been the cause, Pearson hit out at the social media giant, accusing them of quelling any dissent towards Obama. Dumped: C. J. Pearson (seen here in a picture from his public page on Facebook) had his personal page deactivated after the social media giant became aware of his age. The first sign that something had gone awry came on Friday morning when Pearson informed his followers on his public page he had lost his personal account. 'I am having my Editor, Alan Davidson post on my behalf on this page while Facebook continues to lock me out,' wrote the Columbia Middle School student according to\u00a0Fox. 'The 1st amendment is obviously not a big concern to the powers that be at Facebook, but we will continue to fight back!' Demanding a response from Facebook, they duly replied and gave him a cast-iron reason why they banned his page - he is 12. Indeed, it is explicitly stated in Facebook's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account. Drawing attention to yourself:\u00a0CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a viral video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's love for America. In a statement, Facebook said they were alerted to the fact that Pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly. 'You have to be 13 to have a Facebook account. This is a requirement, not a suggestion. He was locked out because he lied about his age, not because of the content,' replied a Facebook representative. Pearson however, is not having that. 'I would consider that complete malarkey,' said Pearson to Fox DC. 'Because in all honesty, there are many many people younger than me who have a Facebook account.' 'I will not stop here,' he added to FOX 5. 'You cannot silence a voice that deserves to be heard. And I will continue to make as many accounts as possible.' Pearson made a number of media appearances over the weekend to draw attention to his plight. 'Time and time again, Facebook has shut down many conservative accounts after they decide to speak up,' Pearson said on Fox & Friends Sunday. Defense: Giuliani wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he didn't want to question Obama's motives or heart. Attacked: Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that President Barack Obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should. 'When a person decides to speak up, their voice shouldn\u2019t be hindered because of someone disagreeing.' Last week, Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America at a fundraising dinner for Governor Scott Walker, but he found a backer in Pearson. He told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - that 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.' Democrats, the White House, and even members of the GOP have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician, who was a Presidential contender in 2008. After the tide of criticism, middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video agreeing with Giuliani, in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'. The video, posted last Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 1.4m views as of Monday night. A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'. For his part, Giuliani has said that he stands by his controversial comments made last month. However, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he 'didn\u2019t intend to question President Obama\u2019s motives or the content of his heart'.", "candidates": [["C.J.

While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene.\u00a0Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the\u00a0White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I\u2019m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State. Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth \u2026 we have some things we are going to try and figure out.'

A Maryland woman who stood by while her husband horrifically whipped, shook and kicked his grandson to death has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors say Melissa Dawn Brittle, 38, of Thurmont, Maryland, encouraged husband Raymond Brittle to punish two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins - who was staying with the Brittles and their three children at the time. Robert died in a Washington, DC, hospital on September 8, 2013 following injuries that State's Attorney Charlie Smith called the most horrific he has ever seen, according to the Frederick News-Post. Mrs Brittle waited until the next day to take the unconscious boy to the hospital. She told police that Robert had fallen down the stairs. Mrs Brittle's lawyer argued that she was terrified of her emotionally abusive husband and intimidated into covering up his violence against little Robert. Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh told Daily Mail Online that Brittle had no job, no high school diploma and no driver's license. 'We adamantly denied that she encouraged the child in any way,' Mrs Drawbaugh said. Raymond Brittle has admitted to horrifically beating two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins to death in September 2013. The Brittles were looking after the boy for his mother. 'She did come clean and cooperated with police and did facilitate a call to her husband in which he confessed to the crime.' Drawbaugh asked for a 12-year sentence, the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for the case, arguing that Mrs Brittle helped bring about her husband's guilty plea and had been prepared to testify against him. Mrs Brittle faced up to 40 years in prison under a state law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse. A judge on Wednesday ordered her held for 20 years, with 20 years suspended. Robert Dean Watkins was the step-grandson of Raymond Brittle. Raymond and Melissa has agreed to take care of the child for his mother. Raymond Brittle has also pleaded guilty in the child abuse case and faces 55 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. Prosecutors say he routinely beat and battered Robert while he was caring for his grandchild. On September 5, he became enraged at the boy when he wouldn't eat dinner. He whipped the children with a belt and kicked him. Investigators say he also lifted the boy by his head and shook him.

An inspection of the exclusive  school, where alumni include Prince Charles and singer Lily Allen, criticised it for breaching health and safety measures as well as failing to ensure its young students make adequate progress. Hill House Independent Junior School was rated 'inadequate' in every single category by Ofsted inspectors. The former prep school attended by Prince Charles (pictured centre, introducing his mother, Queen Elizabeth to teachers) could be closed after Ofsted inspectors rated it 'inadequate' in all five areas. Hill House was also criticised for focusing on getting older pupils to practice entry tests for secondary schools at the expense of teaching them in depth about their subjects. The family run school, which is based at several houses in Kensington and Chelsea, has previously been described as 'eccentric' in the Good Schools Guide. It has almost 1,000 pupils who attend from the age of four to 11. The Department for Education said the next stage in the process is for ministers to review the report. A spokesman said 'all options' remained open, despite the school's independent status. This includes closure or helping leaders come up with an action plan to improve. Lily Allen is among the school's famous alumni. Among the criticisms leveled at the school by inspectors, who visited at the beginning of December last year, was the poor educational attainment by pupils. The report said: 'Too few pupils make adequate progress across the school, particularly in writing and mathematics. 'Leaders and proprietors do not have the capacity to secure essential improvements. They are not taking any action to secure effective teaching.\u00a0They do not know if pupils are making the progress of which they are capable.' Behaviour and safety of pupils also achieved a blistering 'inadequate' rating by inspectors. While pupils were regarded as polite with 'excellent manners' and generally good behaviour, their safety was raised as a concern. Inspectors highlighted poor attention paid to health and safety. It said 'The safety of pupils and adults is compromised on some of the school sites. The report branded fire evacuation procedures 'flawed', with records lacking detail and staff lacking training to deal with problems. It said the supervision of children was sometimes 'lax' and some fire exits could be a hazard. Ofsted inspectors rated the school as 'inadequate' in each of the five categories of leadership and management; behaviour and safety of pupils; quality of teaching; achievement of pupils; early years provision. The prep school was ranked as inadequate in all five areas that were inspected by Ofsted in December. A spokesman from the Department for Education said: 'We have just received a copy of Ofsted's published report following an inspection at Hill House International Junior School. 'Ministers are studying that report and will confirm their decisions about regulatory action shortly. 'It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied the findings, but all options remain open - including closure.

The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass. While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface \u2013 while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue. Smith embraces with \u00a0Murray after the latter's straight sets win secured GB's quarter-final berth. Murray (middle) is looked on in envy by his fellow GB team-mates after securing a tie against France. Sportsmail understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the July 17-19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so. Unfortunately, because it takes about a week to set up the court, a Bette Midler concert would rule out taking the quarter-final to The Hydro, the city\u2019s biggest indoor venue. But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards. Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: \u2018The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world\u2019s top sporting cities.

But when Richard and Sara from Newport think of their nine-year-old son Toby's future, they see prison. The schoolboy, who features in a new programme tonight on Channel 5 called My Violent Child, has suffered from bouts of extreme violence since he was very young - even at the age of four he threatened his older brother, then five, with a knife. Scroll down for video. Sara and Richard from Newport are struggling to control their nine year old son Toby, who suffers from violent outburtss. Despite still not reaching double figures, he has already been in trouble with the police for causing permanent damage to a fellow child's mouth after hitting them with a brick. His father Richard said: 'From a very young age he was very aggressive. When he was about four, he held a knife to Casey and threw bricks at Casey.' He continued: 'We've had police at the house where he's thrown brick - a child ended up injured and needing dental treatment. 'I expect for Toby in his teens to be locked up, we're expecting that. Because he doesn't care.' Sara comforts Toby after one of his outbursts. The couple, who have three other children; Casey, 10, Corey, seven, and Jacob, four, have been unable to control Toby's behaviour for years because they have no idea what the root of the problem is or what will start him off. Sara said: 'Absolutely anything sets Toby off, it can be anything as daft as two items of food touching on his plate, a noise, a smell or something he sees - it can be anything. 'He's physically abusive, he's mentally abusive, he really gets to you - to the point that he makes me want to cry sometimes. 'Sometimes I just let him pinch me and hit me and then he'll calm down and sometimes he does. 'I don't want to live on edge every day when he wakes up, I should be able to enjoy being his mum.' Toby attacks his mother during a tantrum. Sara and her son Casey try to get Toby off a bike during one of his outbursts. The brunt of Toby's behaviour is borne by his parents - Richard and Sara have both been strangled by their son and during the hour-long programme, he is regularly filmed punching, biting and kicking them both. But the violence also extends to his brothers, including four-year-old Jacob, who is filmed being kicked by Toby in the park. His nature has become so unpredictable that Sara reveals she is worried about leaving them alone in a room. Sara reveals that she often just allows Toby to kick and punch her to calm him down. Sara said: 'I can't leave him with his brothers because I know he'll hit them.' The strain has become so great on Sara and Richard that it has almost split them up several times. Richard said: 'It has driven us to the point where we could have parted ways many times. 'When there's no more you can do for each other and we're struggling, it gets to the point where it would be easier to turn and walk away.' In an effort to find out what is causing Toby's outbursts, the programme makers call in parenting expert Sarah Evans. Following a discussion with Sara, she discovers that the very early years of his life were fraught with stress from the family's living situation. From left: Father Richard, Casey, 10, Toby, nine, Corey, seven, Jacob, four, and Sara. Sara and Richard had their eldest child Casey when Sara was just 14 years old, then 10 months later she gave birth to her second son Toby. Because of the strain of having two children so close together, Sara reveals that she was very stressed and admits that she didn't bond with Toby as well as she would have hoped. Sarah Evans then talks the family through a series of tricks that she can use to enforce the bond between mother and son and explains that much of Toby's behaviour may be down to the lack of affection. Sara attempts a bonding exercise with Toby. As Sara starts to use tactile behaviour, including hugging Toby when he is having a tantrum or lightly touching his hand, she sees that her son starts to come out of his tantrums much quicker. Sarah also discusses the importance of Richard spending time with his family. Richard works long hours six days a week in a car business in order to provide for his family, but Jane emphasises that his children also need him to be around at home. The family then spend a day at the farm together and the couple admit that they are beginning to see big improvements in their son. Sara said: 'It is early days but I hope that if I persevere with it then we'll get results down the line and I think that day will come.'

Lance Hohaia  scores first try for\u00c2\u00a0of St Helens on Friday night. Widnes led at the break thanks to tries from Eamon O'Carroll and Patrick Ah Van in front of 7,772 fans. The hosts were missing skipper Kevin Brown, Cameron Phelps, Lloyd White, Manase Manuokafoa and Hep Cahill with Danny Craven, Stefan Marsh, Grant Gore and Macgraff Leuluai back after last week's defeat at Huddersfield. St Helens, without James Roby and banned Kyle Amor, were strengthened by the return of Burns from suspension, while Paul Wellens reverted to his old full-back spot in the absence of injured Jonny Lomax. Josh Jones and Andre Savelio replaced injured Mark Percival and Mark Flanagan, who were also injured in the win at Wakefield with Luke Walsh still missing. Widnes notched their first home win over Saints for 20 years last season and made a flying start with O'Carroll charging over from short range after Danny Tickle was held short. Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook has the ball stripped from him by the tackle from Stefan Marsh of Widnes. Tickle had no problem with the straightforward conversion to fire his side into a 6-0 lead. Alex Walmsley almost forced his way over for Saints but was bundled into touch by determined tackling. The Vikings defence was not as impressive after 15 minutes with Hohaia scampering over from dummy half, with Burns adding the goal to level at 6-6. Saints continued to pile on the pressure before Widnes were only denied on the break by a try saving tackle from Tommy Makinson on Joe Mellor before a thundering midfield burst by Ah Van. Makinson was forced to quit injured with Widnes regaining the lead with Rhys Hanbury's pass putting Ah Van over in the corner and Marsh booting the touchline conversion with Tickle having gone off. Marsh struck a penalty five minutes before the interval to make it 14-6 and Saints could have no complaints after sloppy handling. Jon Wilkin gives thumbs up to Saints fans at the end of the game. Paddy Flynn failed to collect the restart and Widnes paid the price with Ah Van fumbling a Jon Wilkin kick - Vea pounced and Burns converted to cut the gap to 14-12. The Vikings lost Chris Dean with a rib injury and were forced to drop out twice in quick succession from under their own posts as Saints stepped up the tempo. The pressure told with teenage forward Thompson forcing his way over to give Saints the lead for the first time after 53 minutes with Burns' kick edging them ahead 18-14. Saints put daylight between the sides four minutes later after a thundering burst from Vea with Wellens in support to send Turner over and make it 24-14. Hohaia wriggled over for his second try to add to the Vikings' woes on the hour and stretch the lead to 30-14.

Scroll down for video. Technicians will take four years to eliminate almost 800,000 artillery shells containing mustard agent. The chemical agent, commonly known as mustard gas, is actually a liquid which smells like the condiment. It is estimated that there are 2,600 tonnes of the chemical agent contained within 780,000 shells at the facility. Bruce Huenefeld, who is managing the destruction process said: 'Everybody's really excited, but we're being cautious, making sure all the procedures are followed exactly.' Mustard agent can maim or kill by damaging skin, the eyes and airways. It's being destroyed under a 1997 international treaty banning all chemical weapons. It will take four years to destroy the Pueblo stockpile. Another 523 tons of mustard and deadly nerve agents are stored at Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky. Blue Grass isn't expected to start destroying its weapons until 2016 or 2017, finishing in 2023. The destruction process is safe, officials said. Most of Pueblo's stockpile will be dismantled and neutralised in a highly automated $4.5 billion plant built at the depot. The Pueblo Chemical Depot \u00a0in southern Colorado has a method of destroying damaged chemical shells. The United States said it never used mustard agent in any conflict and agreed to destroy their stockpile. About 1,400 damaged shells and a dozen metal bottles of mustard agent are considered unsuitable for that plant. They'll be opened with explosives and neutralised in the sealed chamber, which sits inside an airtight structure near the larger automated plant. The metal bottles contain mustard that was extracted from the shells for testing. A single bottle was the first container to be opened and neutralised Wednesday. Crews were waiting for the neutralisation to finish before draining the chamber, rinsing it and then removing the remains of the bottle. Once all the bottles are destroyed, crews will start work on the damaged shells, depot spokesman Thomas Schultz said. The automated plant isn't expected to begin work until December or January. Design and construction have taken years, and final testing and training are underway. Mustard agent is a thick liquid, not a gas as commonly believed. It has no color and almost no odor, but it got its name because impurities made early versions smell like mustard. The U.S. acquired 30,600 tons of mustard and nerve agents, but it never used them in war. Nearly 90 per cent of its original stockpile has already been destroyed, mostly by incineration. The depots in Colorado and Kentucky are using chemical neutralisation because residents and officials expressed concerns about the vapor from incineration.", "candidates": [["The United States Army is destroying almost 800,000 artillery shells containing mustard agent, which can maim or kill by damaging skin, the eyes and airways.

Some lawmakers are upset that lethal weapons haven't already been included as part of $75 million in new aid announced Wednesday. Asked during a White House press briefing to confirm that the U.S. won't send weapons to the former Soviet nation, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'That's not necessarily accurate.' 'I can't,' he said. 'The President, I think, in his own mind, is continuing to evaluate the situation in eastern Ukraine,' Earnest told reporters, 'and continuing to assess the risk that's associated with providing additional lethal assistance to the Ukrainian military.' Scroll down for video. STILL ON THE TABLE: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the Obama administration hasn't ruled out sending lethal military aid to Ukraine. BROKEN DOWN: Ukraine's military vehicles are being repaired with COINS where bullet-holes have made them otherwise unfit for new duties on the front lines. NEW COSTS? Russian President Vladimiar Putin has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula. Obama is weighing the consequences of putting new lethal weapons in the hands of Ukraine's military, weighing the risks that it could further inflame a conflict in which more than 6,000 people have already lost their lives. 'That bloodshed is something that we're trying to avoid and de-escalate,' Earnest said. 'So the president is very mindful of the potential risk that's associated with providing additional lethal military assistance to the Ukrainians.' Members of Congress from both parties have repeatedly urged Obama to provide Ukrainian soldiers with lethal weapons to defend themselves. Cory Fritz, spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, told the Associated Press that the new aid 'will be completely ineffective.' 'The Ukrainians are begging for help, and the Congress is begging the administration to provide the defensive lethal assistance we authorized in December. Our allies deserve better,' Fritz said. CHEWING IT OVER: Obama, seen Tuesday in Atlanta, Georgia, is said to be mulling the geopolitical pros and cons of standing up to Putin by sending new defensive weapons to Kiev. DEVASTATION:  Pro-Russian rebels last week inspected the rubble of a destroyed coal mine that was used as a Ukrainian army outpost. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of 13 lawmakers wrote on Tuesday to Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran and Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top dogs on the Appropriations Committee, asking them to set aside funds specifically for 'defensive weapons' earmarked for Ukraine. 'While these weapons would not allow Ukraine to outmatch the Russian military, they would enable Ukraine to better defend itself and increase the costs of President Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine,' they wrote. 'By increasing costs for President Putin\u2019s aggression, it would discourage future aggression in eastern Europe that could even more directly threaten U.S. national security interests.' Another pair of senators, Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, reached across the aisle to jointly demand that the White House green-light new weapons allocations. 'Now is the time for the United States to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself from continued Russian aggression,' the wrote in a letter to the president. 'We should not be misled by Vladimir Putin's repeated efforts to exploit nominal ceasefire agreements.' Putin, the president of Russia, has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula. Corker and Menendez said in their letter that providing defensive weapons to Ukraine could 'impose a greater military cost on Russia' for its aggressive movements. 'After countless broken promises by the Kremlin, it is clear that Moscow's aggression in Ukraine can only be stopped if Putin realizes that the United States and Europe are unequivocally committed to helping Kiev impose this military cost on Russia,' they insisted. HANGING ON BY A PRAYER:  Father Alexandr Matveev led his congregation in servcies held in his office on March 8; their Russian Orthodox church's main hall was destroyed by Russian shelling in 2014. APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED: US senators from both sides of the political aisle want the White House to send weapons to Ukrainian soldiers, and they're willing to spend taxpayer dollars to do it. Word of Wednesday's new aid package came in a telephone call Wednesday from Vice President Joe Biden to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The White House said Biden also expressed concern that Russian-backed separatists are violating cease-fire agreements in eastern Ukraine and keeping out international monitors. Earnest said the new aid includes unmanned drones to help defend Ukrainian forces and enhance their communication; radios and other secure communications equipment; radars to warn and protect against mortar and artillery fire; and medical equipment, including military ambulances.

King then tweeted Friday how much he paid the state in taxes over the last two years. The entire tax controversy stems from a plan being considered by the governor of Maine to overhaul tax.

For weeks, Netanyahu's Likud party trailed in opinion polls to the Zionist Union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary Israelis better. Those polls turned out to be wrong. Instead, the Likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee, based on 99% of the vote. Its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government.

Arabs make up about 20% of Israel's population. \"The right regime is in danger,\" Netanyahu said. \"We have an urgent wake-up call. Bring your friends, bring your family, vote for Likud.\" Those appeals appear \"to have energized that right-wing base,\" according to CNN's Elise Labott. Netanyahu still has to form a new government, a process that President Reuven Rivlin said he hopes will start Sunday. If the Likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave Israel not much different than it was before the election, with a conservative Netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug-in opposition. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory. Isaac Herzog, who led the Zionist Union, called Netanyahu to concede defeat. But he and fellow opposition leader Tzipi Livni won't go away, with Herzog insisting that \"nothing has changed.\" \"This is not the time for coalitions and governments,\" Herzog said, apparently ruling out joining forces with Netanyahu as the Labor Party has done before. \"I think what Israel is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth. \"And I'm telling everyone, 'Believe, a change will come.' \" Official results will not be released until next week, with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer. No party has ever won a majority of seats in the Knesset, meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of Israel. The victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61-seat majority. Aaron David Miller, an ex-adviser to the U.S. government on Arab-Israeli negotiations now with the Wilson Center, predicts former Israeli Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon will be the \"kingmaker\" in any coalition government deal based on the support his Kulanu party got Tuesday. How does Israel's parliament work? There's no guarantee Netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister. But he's got a better chance than anyone, and overnight he vowed to work \"quickly and responsibly to form a new government.\" \"Our country's everyday reality doesn't give us the luxury for delay,\" Netanyahu said. If he does lead the next government, he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in Israel -- thanks to his back-to-back-to-back election wins. Many woke up Wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that Netanyahu's latest six-year term could be coming to an end. Israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the Zionist Union would win the vote or, at least, finish in a dead heat with Likud. Exit polls from Israel's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck, not the apparent five-seat advantage that Likud appears to have secured. So what happened? Pollster Avi Degani, who predicted a Likud win all along, said other pollsters relied too heavily on Internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" Degani said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the", "candidates": [["Netanyahu has declared victory as Israel's Prime Minister after a bitter campaign punctuated by his last-minute appeals to right-wing voters.

One of the great mysteries of mankind \u2014 and I mean mankind \u2014 may have been solved. Scientists from King\u2019s College London have measured 15,000 penises in 16 countries. This work has allowed them, after feeding the findings into computers, making boffinish statistical adjustments, twiddling knobs and squinting at graphs, to announce an average size for chaps\u2019 undercarriage. That, in turn, has been seized on as having psychological significance. Apparently, we men are now less likely to have a nervous collapse about our own shortcomings. Quentin says that\u00a0Michelangelo\u2019s 16th century statue of the naked David (pictured), can sometimes be a source of fun for being a 'tiddler' We have not been told the logistical ins and out, if that is the term, of this ground-breaking global operation. The research demanded at least two readings (one at ease, one standing to quivering attention) for each handsome specimen. The mind boggles. Were the laboratory assistants who took the data dreary, middle-aged men speaking in the monotones of E. L. Wisty (the know-it-all creation of the comedian Peter Cook)? Or were they busty, sultry ladies with husky larynxes and widening eyes? To what level of exactitude were the measurements taken? What instruments were employed \u2014 school rulers, tape measures, laser micrometers or (ouch) cold, industrial calipers? While we\u2019re about it, exactly how, in 16 languages, do you say \u2018sorry to interrupt your busy day, monsieur, but would you mind dropping your drawers so that my pouting assistant Miss Droop can take the bore and length of your old man\u2019? But back to the conclusions. Dr David Veale, the fine body of a man who led the psychiatrists from King\u2019s, has announced that the average length of an erect penis is 5.16 in. Typically, it sounds more in Continental centimetres \u2014 13.12 cm. The figure shrivels to 3.6 in when the member is in a state of genial repose. If we can place this in context, the late Sue Townsend\u2019s spotty schoolboy character Adrian Mole fretted that his \u2018thing\u2019 rose to a mere 4.3 in, something that gave the poor lad hours of angst, while the once accepted norm, at least of myth, was nearly half as much again \u2014 the old \u2018six inches of proud British manhood\u2019. Michelangelo\u2019s 16th century statue of the naked David, sometimes a source of fun for being a tiddler, may not have been so unusual after all. You may think it peculiar that I dwell on these matters, not least for what I am about to say: I seriously doubt that many blokes are much concerned by these readings. I do not mean that they will not have been interested and amused by yesterday\u2019s news reports. Indeed, I bet most of us, when we read the Mail, discreetly did some thumbwork to try to work out what 5.16 in looks like, and then had a rough gander below decks to see how we fared by comparison. But will men have been psychologically affected? Does size matter to us as it is said to matter, particularly to our wives and girlfriends? Or is this yet another attempt by the medical/psychiatric world to create collywobbles where previously few existed? Dr Veale said his findings would \u2018help doctors reassure the large majority of men that the size of their penis is in the normal range\u2019. He said he would \u2018use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position\u2019. Another doctor disclosed that some men, poor fellows, suffer from something called body dysmorphic disorder, which can cause a person to have a distorted view of how he looks. Apparently, this is a serious source of anxiety to some gents, who become convinced they are laughably tiny. One does not wish to downplay the gravity of body dysmorphic disorder, which no doubt exists. One naturally has sympathy with those who may worry that they have been given short commons in the trouser department by the Almighty. But is this perhaps a case of publicly employed scientists going to expensive lengths to investigate a not particularly widespread problem? Is male appendage size quite possibly a false hoo-hah created by society? It has been said that the late\u00a0Dame Elizabeth Taylor (pictured) had physical difficulty with one of her early husbands, so enormous was his manhood. There may be extreme cases of smallness or vastness, where it can create disharmony between men and their sexual partners.

'I was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation,'she said. 'So I thought OK whilst we do that I need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same.' Under the terms of her new deal, Rinaldi took out an apartment, where she lived from Monday to Friday and would bed her conquests. But over the weekend she would go back to Mansfield, and the two would live as a married couple, without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart. 'The ground rules were safe sex, not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances,' she explained. 'But at the end of the year, we each broke two rules.' To find willing participants in her project Robin decided not to pick up men at bars, but to be more strategic in her search. 'I was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had I picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand,' she explains. 'So I felt like going about it in a more clear-headed, conscious way.' Robin posted an online ad, entitled Good Girl Seeks Experience. In the post, she wrote: 'I'm a 44-year-old professional, educated, attractive woman in an open marriage, seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality.' 'I said I wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks. I explained that if it led to sex then great, but that I couldn\u2019t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times.' The next day, Robin had 23 offers and over the course of the year had 12 sexual partners, including two women. Struggle: Robin said her husband, Scott Mansfield, right, was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children, driving her to want lovers instead. So would she advise it? \u2018Not if you want to stay married,' she told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden. 'Read my book instead and have an armchair adventure.' 'I was well aware it would be very risky \u2013 but I didn\u2019t think we had that much to lose. 'This 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle. 'That happened at first,' she said, but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart.

{"abstract": "The Green Party's spring conference in Liverpool showcased their unique approach to politics, including meditative breaks and a keynote speaker identified as 'a non-binary person from Belarus'. Despite their unconventional methods, the party has seen a surge in membership, attracting 100 recruits a day from people disillusioned with traditional party politics. The Greens' policies include banning the monarchy, House of Lords, most cars, and extending human rights to all animals, as well as free university education, social care, universal childcare, 500,000 new homes, and a basic income for everyone.", "article": "Bumbling: Natalie Bennett on stage at the spring conference in Liverpool. The Greens like to do things differently. One of their deputy leaders had just blown a few billion pounds more from their wish-list budget when the chairwoman \u2013 who could hardly be seen in her green jumper against the vast green background \u2013 announced an \u2018attunement\u2019. This turned out to be a reflective \u2013 and to my mind rather long \u2013 minute\u2019s silence. \u2018It\u2019s incredibly successful if people get stressed,\u2019 explained our host, although several people around me merely used the pause to check social media on their smartphones. Welcome to the world of Britain\u2019s wackiest political party, on display this weekend at its spring conference in Liverpool. There is something mildly amusing about a party that insists on meditative breaks, has a keynote speaker identified as \u2018a non-binary person from Belarus\u2019 and chairwomen who say things like: \u2018I would like to hear from someone who does not identify as a man.\u2019 And a party that uses such a contorted form of internal democracy it ends up with daft policies to ban most cars and seriously debates proposals to extend human rights to all animals. Yet this is currently the country\u2019s most successful political party, attracting 100 recruits a day from people dismayed by traditional party politics. Bizarrely, the duffest interviews given by its bumbling leader Natalie Bennett only drive up membership. Joining the hundreds of enthusiastic delegates \u2013 a mixture of grizzly bearded hippies, elderly ideologues, earnest young recruits and well-spoken women in charity shop chic \u2013 offered fresh insight into what is now the third biggest party in England and Wales. They proclaim the politics of the future. Yet much of the time it felt like I had stumbled into an Alan Bennett sketch filled with middle-class people munching on non-meat sandwiches as they debated how to save a world wrecked by austerity, bankers and Conservatives. Scroll down for video. Bennett (the leader, that is) told her adoring followers the Greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today. This is undoubtedly impressive. But it also means they might play an influential role in determining who runs the country after the next Election. Many of these new members \u2013 half of whom voted Liberal Democrat at the last Election \u2013 are young people inspired by the idea of reshaping politics. They were given special badges declaring their status and enthusiastically snapped up green T-shirts on sale. Presumably they were not the people targeted in a seminar explaining how to use email. Yet for all these new recruits rushing around excitedly, there were also the same old stalls offering vegan recipes for raspberry cake, T-shirts emblazoned with \u2018Still Hate Thatcher\u2019 and angry leaflets denouncing the monarchy. Bennett  told her followers the Greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today. On one, I found Jon Liebling, a friendly 47-year-old dancer promoting the medicinal use of cannabis. He said he had smoked the drug for 26 years to curb anxiety attacks. His stall proclaimed \u2018United Patients Alliance with Norml Women\u2019s Alliance\u2019. When I asked about Norml Women, he said its founders \u2018felt there was too much testosterone in the cannabis movement\u2019 \u2013 but they had not turned up and he had forgotten the acronym\u2019s meaning. The Australian-born Bennett promises a new style of politics \u2013 which many people might say she exemplifies with her stumbling interviews and inability to explain key policies. Yet after she spoke on Friday, managing to avoid \u2018mind blanks\u2019 as she promised lots of new taxes, the grey-haired woman next to me could not stop gushing: \u2018I am so excited. I am overwhelmed. I feel like I belong here.\u2019 She turned out to be a Labour deserter. And this is why the sudden Green surge is giving her previous party palpitations as it is outflanked on the left. Indeed, electoral mathematics mean it is possible the Greens might not just impact on voting outcomes in May but even be in position to join a coalition led by Ed Miliband. This is a party that wants to ban the monarchy, House of Lords, much of the Armed Forces, free schools, foie gras and fur \u2013 while freeing up drugs, borders, brothels and, said its leader, allowing people to join terror groups such as Islamic State. Yesterday they chucked in free university undergraduate education, joining the Greens\u2019 desires for free social care, free universal childcare, 500,000 extra new homes and a basic income for everyone costing almost three times the budget of the National Health Service. Since they also want to end economic growth, I asked their press team how these policies would be paid for. \u2018There\u2019s lots of money around,\u2019 replied one party veteran, looking at me as though I was stupid.

The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan on February 10 - 24 hours after his wife, Kim Vuong, reported him missing. On Wednesday, six weeks after her husband\u2019s brutal murder, Vuong spoke to the media outside the Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s headquarters in Washington D.C. Scroll down for video. Kim Vuong made an emotional plea for anyone with information about husband David Messerschmitt's death at The Donovan hotel in Washington D.C. on February 10 to come forward on Wednesday. David Messerschmitt, pictured with his wife Kim Vuong, was found stabbed to death inside a boutique hotel in Washington, D.C. six weeks ago. Police are still unclear of the motive. Vuong asked the public for help in solving the mystery surrounding her husband's death. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. Messerschmitt, a 30-year-old D.C. attorney, was found partially clothed and stabbed in the back at the upscale boutique hotel. Vuong told police she last saw her husband on February 8 and received a text from Messerschmitt around 7:30 p.m. the following day that said he would behome soon. Messerschmitt never made it home and Vuong reported him missing on February 9. Messerschmitt's body was discovered the morning of February 10, reports ABC7. Also at Wednesday\u2019s press conference police confirmed that a person of interest captured in previously released surveillance video was a woman. She can be seen wearing a dark, hooded jacket while walking through the lobby and a stairwell. Police have asked for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Authorities have released images from surveillance footage showing a 'person of interest' at the hotel, who they have now confirmed is a woman. Before taking the stairs, the unidentified person waited impatiently for an elevator at the hotel around 7.45pm. Detective Paris White told Daily Mail Online last month that theft was not considered a motive in the crime because all of the victim's valuables, including his wallet, had been left at the scene. The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from the hotel. Vuong was not aware her husband was at The Donovan when he sent the text message and she couldn't provide other details of his plans for that day, Detective White said. The DC Metropolitan detective said that the investigation was 'looking at everything' surrounding Messerschmitt's murder, including his work as a lawyer. His laptop was seized and investigators had trawled his social media accounts for clues. The lawyer was found dead at The Donovan, pictured, five blocks from the White House and around three miles from the apartment he shared with his wife. It was not yet clear why he was even at the hotel. Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009. After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati. In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate.

Scroll down for video. Nigel Farage says employers should be able to 'discriminate' over who them employ based on nationality, saying race hate is no longer an issue. IN THE C4 INTERVIEW:. Trevor Phillips:\u00a0'In Ukip land there would be no law against discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour?' Nigel Farage:\u00a0'No. We are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind.' TODAY ON BBC RADIO 4. Nigel Farage: 'I didn\u2019t mention race at all \u2013 it was no part of that interview with Trevor Phillips at all.' In a Channel 4 documentary, Mr Farage claimed concern over preventing racial discrimination in employment 'would probably have been valid' 40 years ago and he would get rid of'much of' existing legislation. He also described some Muslims in Britain as a 'fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us'. Setting out the case for scrapping race laws, Mr Farage said: 'I think the situation that we now have, where an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland, is a ludicrous state of affairs. 'I think that we have taken our relationship with Europe to a level that, frankly, has gone against common sense, and certainly against self-interest. 'I would argue that the law does need changing, and that if an employer wishes to choose, or you can use the word 'discriminate' if you want to, but wishes to choose to employ a British-born person, they should be allowed to do so. 'I think you should be able to choose on the basis of nationality, yes.\u00a0I do.' He added: 'If we'd sat here 40 years ago, having this conversation, your point [on the need for anti-discrimination laws] would probably have been valid. I don't think it is today.' Prime Minister David Cameron used Twitter to issue a public condemnation of Mr Farage's comments. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the comments were 'wrong, dangerous and divisive' while\u00a0Lib Dem Nick Clegg Clegg accused Mr Farage of 'instilling fear' Mr Farage was speaking in an interview with ex-equalities watchdog chief Trevor Phillips for a Channel 4 documentary, Things We Won't Say About Race That Are True, due to be broadcast next week. He claimed the rise of British-born Islamist extremists going to fight with ISIS in Syria had fuelled an 'uptick' in public concern. He added: 'I think perhaps one of the reasons the polls show an increasing level of concern is because people do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us. So don't be surprised if there isn't a slight increase in people's worries and concerns. 'You know, when you've got British, when you've got people, born and bred in Cardiff, with British passports, going out to fight for Isil, don't be surprised if there isn't an uptick in concern. There has been an uptick in concern, but does it make us a prejudiced people? No.' 'There is an especial problem with some of the people who've come here and who are of the Muslim religion who don't want to become part of our culture. 'So there is no previous experience, in our history, of a migrant group that comes to Britain, that fundamentally wants to change who we are and what we are. That is, I think, above everything else, what people are really concerned about.' The remarks sparked a furious row, with political opponents accusing the Ukip leader of fuelling racial tensions. Mr Cameron said: 'Nigel Farage is attention seeking. The laws protect people from racial discrimination. It's deeply concerning he doesn't understand that.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said the comments were 'wrong, dangerous and\u00a0divisive'. Mr Miliband added: 'I believe that Britain should be proud of the fact that we are a tolerant country, we're a country of different faiths, different backgrounds.

Shearer, who scored over 200 goals for Newcastle, believes the St James' Park faithful will consider giving up their season tickets soon because of the lack of investment and hope. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was among the crowd of spectators at St James' Park on Saturday. 'There is no excitement, no anticipation. It takes its toll, even on the most loyal fans in the country. Fans want to dream their team can be successful, whether that's in a domestic cup competition or in Europe,' Shearer told the Telegraph.

The Football League's complex Financial Fair Play rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs. A tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend. Earlier this month QPR announced they had made a loss of \u00a39.8m but the accounts filed at Companies House now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of the owners, mainly Tony Fernandes, writing off \u00a360m of old loans in an 'exceptional item' in the accounts. QPR owner Tony Fernandes was among those to write off \u00a360million of old loans to the London club. QPR's players get put through their paces in training ahead of Saturday's game against Crystal Palace. Q: Queens Park Rangers accounts for 2013-14 have now been filed in detail at Companies House. What do they show? A: They show that the club\u2019s \u2018true\u2019 losses for last season were \u00a369.8m, instead of the \u00a39.8m declared by the club earlier this month. They used an accounting method, an \u2018exceptional item\u2019, to count a \u00a360m write-off of loans to the owners as effective income. Their real income was \u00a338.7m. Q: Why does this matter? A: Because if clubs lose lots of money in the Championship, where QPR played last season, they face potential \u2018Financial Fair Play\u2019 fines from the Football League. The FFP rules are in place to stop clubs \u2018financial doping\u2019 and stop them spending themselves to bankruptcy. To simplify: clubs that massively overspend, and lose lots of money as a result, face fans which grow in relation to the overspending. Q: How much fine do QPR face? A: If they\u2019d really lost only \u00a39.8m last season, the fine would have been tiny, perhaps not even a million pounds. But if the real loss is \u00a369.8m, the fine could be as high as \u00a358m, and is likely to be at least \u00a350m. That would be the biggest fine on any club for any reason in global football history. Q: Who will decide? A: Lawyers, probably. The parties are locked in talks about what happens next. Q: What do QPR say? A: No comment. Effectively, QPR counted that \u00a360m write-off as extra income. But that money is noted in the accounts as being a'related-party transaction' - and the Football League's own FFP rules explicitly rule out that related party moves of the kind QPR have undertaken. The League rule out such moves in order to prevent 'artificially' lowered losses. A QPR spokesman told Sportsmail: 'We have no comment.' A Football League spokesman reiterated an earlier League statement that the League remains in talks with QPR about the situation, but won't add details. If the League ultimately rule that QPR's'real' losses are \u00a369.8m, then the FFP fine they potentially face will be \u00a357.9m. QPR will legitimately be able to write off some of that \u00a369.8m as acceptable losses - for youth investment, and some bonuses, for example - but realistically they are looking at a fine of \u00a350m-plus. Yet QPR are locked in legal arguments questioning whether the League have the right to levy any fine at all, and if they do, at what levels. QPR posted losses of \u00a365.4m in the 2012-13 season and it was expected these might fall after cost-cutting in the Championship. But the new accounts show in fact that as QPR's income plunged from \u00a360.6m in 2012-13 to \u00a338.7m in 2013-14, there was no significant reduction in the biggest single outgoing - player wages. The wage bill was \u00a378m in the 2012-13 season and \u00a375.4m in 2013-14 in the Championship. Quite how this now plays out remains to be seen: lawyers are likely to remain occupied for weeks if not months or years on both sides. Junior Hoilett (centre) has an effort on goal as QPR prepare for a relegation clash at Selhurst Park. Striker Charlie Austin is in discussions over a new \u00a360,000-a-week deal at Loftus Road. QPR could refuse to pay a Football League fine if Chris Ramsey keeps the club in the Premier League. If QPR avoid relegation from the Premier League this season, they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied and the Football League will not be able to force them to pay while they remain in the Premier League - and outside Football League jurisdiction.

After all, 37-year-old rapper Kanye had spent the afternoon pandering to their toddler as they played on the sands in Malibu. Kanye was beach-ready in a sleeveless vest - albeit in black - with practical trainers while Nori looked cute in a pair of denim shorts and a white vest. Most of Kim's most intimate moments from the last seven years - from her pregnancy to her 2013 divorce -  have been documented on her E! reality show with sisters Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie, as well as mother and manager Kris and step father Bruce Jenner.

Georgie was rushed to surgery to undergo an operation to connect the oesophagus to the trachea just 22 hours after she was born on July 10 2014. Georgie Yorke, now eight months, was born with birth defects meaning whenever she was fed, milk shot back out of her nose and mouth. She is pictured with parents Stacey Ross, 25 and Vic Yorke. Georgie\u00a0was born with the birth defects oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - meaning her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach. Georgie was rushed for an operation to correct the defects when she was just two days old. She has since had five more operations to further correct the problem and rid her of scar tissue. Georgie, aged eight months, is now out of hospital and finally able to enjoy life at home with parents Stacey Ross, 25, and Vic Yorke, 19, from Consett, County Durham. Ms Ross, a travel agent, said: 'When Georgie was born, I was rushed in for an emergency C-section, so I didn't get to hold her in the beginning. 'When I finally tried to feed her that night, the milk was coming out of her nose and mouth and going everywhere - almost like when you drink a fizzy drink and it shoots out of your nose. 'I thought it might have been me - and because I was trying to feed her on my own. 'But when the midwife came around to help me, she realised something was wrong as the milk was going down the wrong tube and Georgie's breathing wasn't right. 'She was taken away from me a few times in the night and taken into special care. It wasn't until they X-rayed her that I was told what was wrong.' Oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that affects the baby's oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. In oesophageal atresia, the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. It often happens together with another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe (trachea). This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass into the lungs. It's not known why the defect develops, but it's more likely to happen in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid in pregnancy (polyhydramnios). The defect means the baby won't be able to swallow and digest food safely, or at all. Oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula are thought to affect about one in 2,500-3,500 births. If they're not corrected soon after birth, the pouch at the end of the oesophagus may fill with food and saliva, which can overflow into the baby's windpipe. Source: NHS Choices. Doctors diagnosed Georgie with oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - two conditions that tend to occur together. In oesophageal atresia, the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. The condition often occurs alongside another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula. This is where the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe (trachea) are connected, rater than being separate. This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass into the lungs. Georgie was kept in surgery for five hours and spent six days in intensive care at the Great North Childrens' Hospital, Newcastle. Ms Ross said: 'I was shocked to see her go straight into surgery, but I didn't really know what to think at first. 'All I could think when I saw her lying there was that I wished it could have been me. 'I couldn't wait for the three of us to get home together, so it wasn't a nice feeling to know that we couldn't even put the banners up at home to welcome the baby.'

The proposals could see pharmacists stationed in surgeries to help meet the day-to-day needs of patients with long-term conditions, including diabetes and asthma. Instead of seeing a GP, those patients could be given an appointment with a pharmacist. They would also liaise with hospitals, community pharmacists and care homes to ensure patients received seamless care. Experts said the move would cut the time patients have to wait for appointments, while also addressing the chronic shortage of GPs at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists. Pharmacists are to be drafted into GP practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors in the NHS, under new plans. Many GP surgeries already work closely with pharmacists, and the proposals would see them working as part of the general team, in a similar way to practice nurses, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said. Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the RCGP, said a 'hidden army' of pharmacists could provide the solution to the pressures facing family doctors. She said: 'Waiting times for a GP appointment are now a national talking point - and a national cause for concern, not least amongst GPs themselves. 'But, even if we were to get an urgent influx of extra funding and more GPs, we could not turn around the situation overnight due to the length of time it takes to train a GP. 'Yet we already have a 'hidden army' of highly trained pharmacists who could provide a solution. 'Practice-based pharmacists, working as part of the clinical team, would relieve the pressure on GPs and make a huge difference to patient care. 'This isn't about having a pharmacy premises within a surgery, but about making full use of the pharmacist's clinical skills to help patients and the overstretched GP workforce.' GP surgeries are predicted to make 370 million patient consultations this year - 70 million more than five years ago. An ageing population and an increase in those patients needing treatment for long-term and complex conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, is, in part, the cause of the mounting pressure. The RCGP said according to their research, there will be 67 million occasions when patients will have to wait a week or longer to see a GP or practice nurse this year. Pharmacists train for five years, one year less than a doctor and a year more than a nurse. As such, the RCGP, which is being backed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, has argued they are ideally placed to treat patients directly within GP practices. The RCGP is calling for general practice funding to be increased to 11 per cent of the NHS budget by 2017 - currently it stands at just over eight per cent. Furthermore, the College is calling for 8,000 more GPs in England by the end of the next Parliament. David Branford, chairman of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society English board, said: 'General practice is the foundation of the NHS but it needs proper resourcing and support. Experts said the move would cut the times patients have to wait for appointments, while also addressing the chronic shortage of GPs at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists. 'Having a pharmacist as part of the team can make a huge difference to both patients and clinical colleagues. 'Pharmacists should be working in GP practices all over the country.  It's a win-win situation for everyone concerned. 'We must be more strategic and change the services on offer to make best use of the NHS workforce. 'Patients deserve access to high quality care and services wherever they live and pharmacists are central to providing this.' Dr Chaand Nagpaul, GP committee chairman at the British Medical Association, said:  'Placing more pharmacists into GP practice teams is a move the BMA has been advocating for some time. 'This proposal has the potential to improve the skills mix in local GP services and raise the number of healthcare professionals on hand to provide help to patients. 'This will be a welcome step forward,given that GP practices are currently under unprecedented strain from rising patient demand and falling resources. 'The implementation of this programme will be key. For it to work properly, there will need to be additional resources to enable enough pharmacists to be placed in GP surgeries.

De Villiers underpinned South Africa's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six, before taking two for 15 from three overs as the UAE were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining. De Villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century, but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 World Cup matches overall. South Africa captain AB de Villiers (right) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the UAE. The explosive batsman hit 99 for the Proteas as they continued they impressive form in the World Cup. De Villers also took two wickets with the ball at the Wellington Regional Stadium on Thursday. The victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for South Africa as the UAE slumped to a fifth defeat in as many World Cup games. The Proteas, already through to the knockout phase, set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at Westpac Stadium. De Villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with David Miller, after Hashim Amla (12), Quinton de Kock (26) and Rilee Rossouw (43) had departed, and added a further 53 in partnership with JP Duminy. Miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over, bowled by Mohammad Naveed, who claimed figures of three for 63. De Villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to Amjad Javed, and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from Kamran Shazad straight to Javed at short third man. His departure signalled the arrival of Farhaan Behardien, though, and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the South African score racing along. Farhaan Bahardien also shone for South Africa with the bat in Wellington. UAE have lost all five of their World Cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs. Duminy (23) became Naveed's third victim when he was trapped lbw, but Behardien and Vernon Philander (10 not out) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand. The UAE's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs. Morne Morkel led the early charge for the Proteas, dismissing Andri Berenger (five) and Khurram Khan (12) as he took two for four from his first four overs, while Duminy claimed Amjad Ali's (21) wicket in between. Shaiman Anwar and Swapnil Patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite, but when Anwar (39) sent Imran Tahir's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again. Saqlain Haider (seven) replaced Anwar at the crease, but he only lasted three overs to become De Villiers' first victim of the day, before Javed (five) followed suit soon after to leave the UAE on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left. De Villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as Naveed (17) top-edged Philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of Mohammad Tauqir (three) and Shazad (nought) meant the UAE fell short of completing their 50 overs.

David Autry, 43, was travelling home on the MetroLink train at 10pm last Monday when he was punched and kicked in the head by the men. The two suspects, a 15-year-old juvenile and a 21-year-old man, will be formally charged tomorrow, police said. Scroll down for video. David Autry, left, was travelling home on the MetroLink train at 10pm on Monday when he was approached by a young man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap who then attacked him. The video shows the suspect unleash a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who tries to block them with his hand and forearms, then the attacker kicks Autry in the head, right. The shocking incident was captured on the train's surveillance camera and also recorded by a passenger who posted his cell phone footage online. The video shows a man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap approach Autry who was sitting at the front of the train. According to Autry, the attacker first asked to use his cell phone. When he refused, the man asked for his opinion on the death of Michael Brown. 'I responded I was too tired to think about it right now,' Autry told KMOV. 'The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face.' Two other men then join in, with one swinging a left hand punch at the victim's head. As the train pulled into a station, the man in the red T-shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, but declined medical treatment. Autry told KMOV he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh. 'I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,' he said. 'And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.' Autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $5,000 to buy a motorcycle. The page was setup on Saturday and he has already raised more $4,500. Autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes. David Autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh. Writing on his GoFundMe page about why he did not fight back, he said: 'First, I was dazed from the sucker punch in the face. 'Second, c'mon 3 against one? I was trying to protect my glasses. I didn't know they were on the floor all bent up and the lens popped out. 'Third, if I had stood up and fought, only white guy on that train car, how do I know I wouldn't be attacked from behind as well? It's easy to say what YOU would have done until you find yourself in that situation.'

Scroll down for video. Frazier Glenn Miller (above) entered a plea of not guilty for charges of capital murder in the killing of three individuals on April 13, 2014. Miller, a supremacist, allegedly opened fire outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas screaming 'Heil Hitler!' Miller (mugsghot above), who says he is ill and does not have much time to live, also asked for a speedy trial. On Friday, Frazier also asked for a speedy trial and to have Internet access while he is in prison. The judge granted him the right to a speedy trial, which will begin August 17, but denied him Internet access. Miller said he would go to trial in 30 days if he could represent himself. Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed. Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car. At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March.

'My goal is to actually write notes for my grandkids and I can't think of a better thing to fight for every single day.' Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness. 'I don't even really think about the fact he has cancer too much because he's so present and always there.' The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household; it began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often. Battling on: Garth says doctors do not know how long he has to live but he's determined to remain strong. Source of support: Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness. Long-running: The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household. Thoughtful gesture: It began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often. Daily dose: So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. Still going strong: But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos. So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos. Some days, she would look at her lunch before he had placed on inside, and she'd demand to know where it was. 'That's when I realized, this is something that really matters,' Garth said. Garth's wife, Lissa, said the task also means he's taken over the chore of making his daughter's lunch, which he tries to keep healthy. 'I think it's great,' she said. 'It's nice that he keeps that connection with her.' Lunchtime treat: He pops the notes in with her lunch, which he tries to make as nutritious as he can. Determined: After learning he had cancer, Garth sought to write 800 notes so that his daughter would have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box. But in 2011, Garth was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because, 'at the end of the day, these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me'. His tumor was successfully removed - but he has since been diagnosed twice more, and his doctor has told him that he will lose his life to the disease. A loss of taste, tiredness and nausea are among the symptoms which blight Garth. He says his ultimate hope is to inspire parents to write notes to their children. His book, Napkin Notes: Make Lunch Meaningful, Life Will Follow, has been published in several countries and half a dozen languages. In the tome, Garth  introduces each chapter with a napkin note and then shares a story connected to it and to his life. The cancer patient is now writing notes ahead of time and storing them away so his daughter can still\u00a0receive\u00a0them after he is gone.

Terry Gibson laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for Wimbledon's Crazy Gang. He will address the myth that the Crazy Gang was ruled by the bullying of John Fashanu and Vinnie Jones, even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing-room fight. But, for now, Gibson wants to laugh rather than seethe. The little striker, who won the Cup, once told Alex Ferguson where to go and pocketed \u00a3200 for scouting Pablo Zabaleta, wants to present a fuller picture of life at Plough Lane. \u2018I remember Dennis Wise,\u2019 he says. \u2018Just after we won the FA Cup in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for Bobby Gould to give him a big move. We went on a trip to Sweden and he\u2019s bought a load of fireworks. Back at the hotel, Wisey is letting them off from the fifth floor into a crowded street. The locals are running for cover. Unbelievable. Bobby knew he was trying to force a move and wouldn\u2019t budge. Just another day at Wimbledon.\u2019 The Wimbledon players celebrate having won the 1988 FA Cup at Wembley against favourites Liverpool. Gibson poses for the camera when speaking to Sportsmail's\u00a0Riath Al-Samarrai about his career. Gibson laughs. \u2018There was a time when Fash was telling the newspapers he was getting threatening letters at the training ground,\u2019 he says. \u2018We all knew it was rubbish so one day I cut out letters from a newspaper, like in the films, and spelled, \u201cMeester Fash, we are watching your every move\u201d. I slipped it in his pocket and when he found it he starts panicking. He disappears with his big mobile phone and the next day\u2019s papers say Fash has had another threat. He always was a drama queen.\u2019 Gibson adds: \u2018My first day at the club, I saw Wisey pinching the Volkswagen badge off Vinnie Jones\u2019s dad\u2019s truck. Vinnie was panicking that his dad was going to kill him. \u2018There were a lot more laughs than people might have thought based only on the documentary.\u2019 John Fashanu, in action during his Wimbledon playing days, was certainly a character in the Crazy Gang. Gibson, like most associated with the programme, The Crazy Gang, has taken exception to claims from Fashanu that he was \u2018the leader\u2019 and ruled by fear. \u2018The truth is we tolerated Fash,\u2019 says Gibson, who spent six years at the club. \u2018He was a bit of a clown. He was the perfect player for us but he always tried to present himself as something he wasn\u2019t, even then. \u2018Yes, you had to be very tough to survive at the club. Grown men would cry. But there was so much more to how Wimbledon achieved what we did. For Fash to imply he controlled our dressing room with intimidation is just false. \u2018Of course there were fights but Fash exaggerated. Jonesy told the story about Fash locking the dressing room and throwing an unnamed player against a bench and splitting his leg open. Stitches, etc. Gibson was former team-mate Lawrie Sanchez's assistant at Wycombe, Northern Ireland and Fulham. \u2018The lad was Robbie Turner and, as I remember it, Fash strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil. They slipped around a bit and no punches were thrown. Yes, Robbie badly injured his calf on the bench but it was not split open with blood everywhere. \u2018The stories were all embellished. It was no Mafia, it was more a boarding school of very naughty boys.\u2019 A deeper perspective is found in Gibson\u2019s new book, Giant Killer. It\u2019s a wonderful autobiography, self-written across three years. The book charts his rise from Tottenham, to Coventry, to Manchester United and on to the high points at Wimbledon, before Gibson became Lawrie Sanchez\u2019s assistant at Northern Ireland, Fulham and Wycombe. The 52-year-old, in action for Wimbledon (right) works for Sky Sports, commenting on Spanish football. \u2018The game changed a bit in those three decades,\u2019 he says. \u2018When Spurs signed me as a kid they offered my parents a holiday and", "candidates": [["The former Wimbledon footballer Terry Gibson has defended his teammates against claims that they were bullied by John Fashanu and Vinnie Jones.

However, a resilient Monaco defence refused to let in another and the French side progressed to the next round on the away goals rule. Sportsmail's Rob Draper was at the game to give the lowdown in France... Arsenal. David Ospina 6. So little to do, the Colombian effectively took the evening off for much of the game. Hector Bellerin 5.5. Loves to get forward, can\u2019t be faulted in his running. But still partial to panicky moments in his own penalty area. Monaco's Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho vies with Arsenal's midfielder Francis Coquelin. Per Mertesacker 6. In control, assured. A different player altogether to the man who fell apart in the first leg. Laurent Koscielny 6.5. Almost opened the scoring with a prod on to the bat from very close range. Had less to do at the back. Nacho Monreal 5.5. Pushed on, got forward, but his delivery on the cross lets him down at times and was exposed at times. Francis Coquelin 6.5. Taking his enforcer role to heart. Twice he crunched Joao Moutinho in half in the first half but avoided a yellow card. Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla attempts a special effort during the UEFA Champions League. Santi Cazorla 6.5. Adequate but not quite the little magician that you were expecting given that he has been Arsenal\u2019s best player of late. Alexis Sanchez 5.5. Strangely lackadaisical in his passing which almost let in Monaco in the eighth minute. Booked \u2013 harshly \u2013 for a dive. His energy was impressive as ever. Mesut Ozil 7. Never stopped trying to create, always looking for the killer pass \u2013 had an extremely organised Monaco midfield with which he had to contend. Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker vies with Monaco's French defender Layvin Kurzawa. Danny Welbeck 7. A veritable bundle of energy, driving into the Monaco penalty area. His pass set up Giroud\u2019s goal. Came off on 71 minutes as influence faded. Olivier Giroud 7.5. Really excellent finish to open the scoring. His reaction and poise once the ball bounced off his head was superb. Redemptive after the first game. Subs. Aaron Ramsey (for Coquelin 62) 7 - Fine reaction and finish when Kurzawa inexplicably gave the ball to him on 79 minutes. Walcott (for Welbeck 72) 6. Gibbs (for Monreal 82) 6. Monaco defender Wallace vies with  French striker Giroud during the match  at Louis II stadium. Manager. Arsene Wenger 7. Game plan was assured, defence was solid and they gave themselves the chance. It did beg the question why they couldn\u2019t have done that in the first leg? Monaco. Danijel Subasic 8. Solid taking crosses and produced good saves, notably from Ozil\u2019s second half free-kick. Unfortunate for Giroud\u2019s goal. Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin vies with Monaco's French forward Anthony Martial during the  match. Fabinho 5. Struggled to maintain composure at times as Arsenal poured forward. A difficult night. Aymen Abdennour 6.5. Was the leader at the back, forever cajoling and generally anticipating much of Arsenal\u2019s attacking intent. Wallace 6. Preferred to the much more experienced Ricardo Carvalho and didn\u2019t let his side down. Layvin Kurzawa 4. Looked vulnerable, especially when Welbeck switched to the right. Dreadful error giving the ball away for the second goal. Monaco's Bulgarian forward Dimitar Berbatov  vies with Arsenal's French midfielder Coquelin. Geoffrey Kondogbia 7.5. Fought, tackled and ran. Did as much anyone to secure Monaco\u2019s passage to the quarters. Jeremy Toulalon 7. Composed, robust, provided leadership, especially in those tricky final few minutes. Nabil Dirar 7.5. Remained a threat even with Monaco camped in their own half. Terrific speed and desire. Joao Moutinho 6.5. Not as influential as the first leg but still fulfilled his duties and brought composure when necessary. Giroud celebrates as he gives Arsenal a glimmer of hope against Monaco at the Louis II stadium. Anthony Martial 5. Strugled to make an impact and taken of on 59 minutes. Dimitar Berbatov 7.

Spaniard Fabregas pleads for a decision under pressure from Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u00a0during a training match. But the Blues boss will give his squad two days off after the West Ham clash and has given them permission to enjoy themselves. Mourinho said: 'Maybe they went out with some family for dinner [after Wembley], but I don't think they did any crazy things because, the next day, I saw them in very good condition. 'They will have Thursday and Friday off, and I told them those are the best moments if they want to do something that people at their age sometimes like to do. 'But they enjoyed it so much after the game on the pitch and in the dressing room, but even on the bus going back to Stamford Bridge was a normal journey.' Eden Hazard twists and turns in an attempt to shake off Oscar as the Brazilian tracks down the Belgian. Hazard has been one of Chelsea's main threats this season with his speed and agility down the flanks.

'Big, difficult game on Wednesday. Big, difficult game next week in the Champions League [against Paris Saint Germain]. We are just happy. Everybody likes to win competitions.' Asked if captain John Terry will sort out new contract terms before the end of the season, Mourinho was certain in his response but admitted he is thinking ahead to life after the 34-year-old. 'Yes, it will be [extended] before the end of the season for sure. What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that. 'Every one of these big guys is difficult to replace, but at the same time you still have the player and he is still an important player, you have to start thinking: 'What next? 'But this is a process that we can take our time over because John is proving again this season that he's a player for years.' Mourinho celebrates with this players after they beat Tottenham to win the Capital One Cup at Wembley. Hazard slides on the Wembley to celebrate in front of the Chelsea fans as his teammates follow. Depending on Manchester City's result against Leicester on Wednesday, Chelsea can either increase their lead or maintain a five point gap at the top of the division with a win against West Ham. However Mourinho refused to underestimate his opposition, revealing that he will not be deploying defender Kurt Zouma in a deep-lying midfield role like he did against Spurs. '[West Ham] have in their hands different ways of playing football, different ways of seeing the game, and with a very good coach like Sam, it's always difficult to play there.' 'I don't play the same team. I don't play the same 11 players, that's for sure. [Zouma] is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear. 'We didn't have Matic and Mikel in a final where it was important to keep the balance of the team. We needed someone to do that job. 'He did very well, but it's not his future at Chelsea to play in that position.' Midfielder John Obi Mikel is expected to be out for a further month after surgery on his knee.

While the shipwreck of the SS William B. Davock was finally found, upside down, by  divers in 1972, an investigation into why it sank was deemed all but impossible, due to the murkiness of the water. Until now. A group of West Michigan-based explorers believe they have determined what caused the Davock to succumb to the 30-foot waves brought on by ferocious blizzard. Scroll down for video. Mystery: The SS William B. Davock, a coal freighter built in 1907, sank to the bottom of Lake Michigan on its way to Chicago on November 11, 1940, during a ferocious storm. The reason for its sinking was unknown. Wreck: The ship sits upside down on the shore of Lake Michigan, 210 feet below the surface and just off the coast of Pentwater. Because of the way it sits and the murkiness of the water, investigations weren't possible. The Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA), a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization, were able to make their way down to the wreck on a clear day last fall. The dive allowed for the first-known footage of the ship to be taken. The footage, taken by MSRA diver Jeff Vos, of Holland, showed\u00a0a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade. 'The waves were so strong, they must have snapped the rudder's connection, at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller,' Vos told Michigan Live. 'With no power or steering, the Davock would have been at the mercy of the storm.' The Davock had little warning the storm was to hit on November 11, 1940. With 75 mph winds, 30-foot waves and rain turning to snow, it is still referred to as 'the most disastrous day in the history of Lake Michigan shipping'. Discovery: During a dive last fall, the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA), a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization were able to capture the first-ever footage of the wreck, determining a rudder the broke in the storm struck the propeller (pictured) Taking coal to Chicago, the Davock went down five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan. Another ship, cargo carrier the\u00a0SS Anna C. Minch, also went down, along with all 24 aboard, while several other ships were damaged and ran aground. MSRA board member, Craig Rich,\u00a0further explained what caused the Davock to sink. 'It would have sent the ship into what we call a shivering mode,' he told MLive. 'Without the rudder, it wouldn't have been able to steer and without the propeller working properly you can't drive it forward. 'The ship would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways which would have swamped the ship.' 'X' marks the spot: The shipwreck of the Davock\u00a0five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan. The freighter was en route to Chicago when it sank. The MSRA was motivated to delve deeper into investigating the Davock after the waters of Lake Michigan started to clear in recent years. 'We decided to give it a shot,' Rich said. \"The divers didn't even use a light for the discovery. 'It's not as warm as it is in the Caribbean, but it's certainly starting to rival it in clarity.

{"abstract": "A new theory suggests that humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than previously thought, as early as 40,000 BC, giving humans an advantage in hunting that led to the wipeout of Neanderthal rivals. Anthropologist Pat Shipman of Pennsylvania State University has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago, after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in Europe. The theory is based on the idea that early wolf-dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison, hounding them until they tired, allowing humans to kill them with spears or bows and arrows.", "article": "It's thousands of years since mankind won dominance over nature, and we're still pretty proud. But  a top researcher says we've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends. Humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 BC, it is claimed, giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our Neanderthal rivals. Man's best friend: An early cave painting in Libya of dogs chasing a deer in the Akakus Mountains. A new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought. Left behind: While early humans hunted with wolves, their Neanderthal rivals in Europe continued using primitive tools without any help, according to anthropologist Dr Pat Shipman (artist's impression) The controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist Pat Shipman of\u00a0Pennsylvania State University. She has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago, after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in Europe. No match: The theory claims Neanderthals (model pictured) were no match for the hunting technique. Instead, she said, humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from Africa up to 70,000 years ago. At the time, our close genetic relatives the Neanderthals were dominant in Europe, fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools. But soon afterwards the rival species died out, leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today's humans. Strong rival theories of their demise include that Neanderthals, just like woolly mammoths, were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters. Dr Shipman, however, told The Observer: 'We formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the Neanderthal. 'Early wolf-dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired. Then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows. 'This meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off \u2013 often the most dangerous part of a hunt \u2013 while humans didn\u2019t have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey. Dogs would have done that. 'Then we shared the meat. It was a win-win situation.' Dr Shipman's theory, shared in her book The Invaders: How Humans and Their Dogs Drove Neanderthals to Extinction, was partly inspired by early dog remains. Crossing paths: Wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia, but only wolves survived in the end. Close relation: A Natural History museum employee examines a model of a Neanderthal during an exhibition last year. Neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences. She examined 33,000-year-old fossils of dogs found in Siberia and Belgium, and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves. Although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today, there were clear signs of domestication, she said - including shorter snouts, densely-packed teeth and wider jaws. The theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors, many of which contradict each other. Last year a study at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany claimed early humans emigrated from Africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago. Another study at the University of Chicago said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all.", "candidates": [["humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than first thought, according to an anthropologist's theory.

Photographer Tupy, 35, says he feared his camera would melt from the overwhelming heat of the lava as he captured the daunting scenes of the\u00a0150-ft wide basalt volcano. 'The view is simply staggering,' said the 35-year-old.\u00a0'Lava inside the volcano is constantly moving, bubbling and bursting.' Scroll down for video. Mental images of the fiery depths of hell can't be far from these very real photographs of Ethiopia's Erta Ale. These incredible images by Czech photographer Karel Tupy capture the world's oldest continuously active lava lake. Lava sprays from the centre of the lake, a rare phenomenon said to be one of just six in the world. Lava illuminates, peeks through cracks and spits (left) and a haze forms above the blazing hot pool in shot by the adventurous 35-year-old. 'The heat was immense, when I got to an edge of the crater, it was unbearable. After couple of seconds, my facial skin was so hot, I had to get away. 'There was even a point where I was afraid my camera was going to melt.' Found in the badland desert area of the Afar Depression in north-eastern Ethiopia,\u00a0Erta Ale's famed lava lake formed around 1906 and is one of six in the world. The volcano's name translates in the local Afar tribe's language as'smoking mountain' while the pit to its south is known by locals as 'The Gateway to Hell', an appropriate moniker given the luminous lava spitting lava and searing heat. Karel Tupy said the view is'staggering', as lava inside the volcano is constantly moving, bubbling and bursting. Erta Ale's name translates as'smoking mountain' in the local Afar language while the pit to its south is called 'The Gateway to Hell' While locals aren't particularly welcoming to outsiders and the surrounding terrain is far from hospitable, tourists do make the journey to witness the natural phenomenon. In 2009, BBC TV show The Hottest Place On Earth went there to record a world first 3D laser image of the volcano.\u00a0Durham University earth scientist Dr Dougal Jerram and a team from the BBC explored the Danakil desert, officially known as the hottest place on Earth. 'Like a true journey to the centre of the Earth, volcanoes provide a unique window into our planet's interior,' he later wrote for BBC\u00a0News. 'Standing at the lip of the lava lake you can see why the locals see this as \"The Gateway to Hell\", as the incandescent bubbling lava lake hisses like some badly burned porridge cauldron, overturning and occasionally belching molten lava.' A visitor mounts his camera on a tripod in a bit to capture the volcano in its full glory while a small group of tourists line the other side. The ferocity of the volcano is clear as lava splashes up from a pool that is said to have formed around 1906. Having gained his own access to the area, in which five people in a group of scientists and tourists were killed while others were taken as hostages in a 2012 attack claimed by the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF), Tupy couldn't agree more with Dr Jerram's impression. 'Even though the lava is about 25 feet below the edge, sometimes during a burst the lake spits the lava outside the crater, so you have to be careful not to get hit by it,' he said. 'What you get hit by quite often though is fumes.' The photographer says while it's vital to avoid contact with lava, obviously, it's the fumes that can be the worry. Poor road access means the only way to efficiently get to the crater is via four-wheel-drive over rugged terrain. A far less dramatic sight, the lava forms a hard, grey layer when it is given the chance to cool. However, the environment gets far worse that what he experienced. In September 2005 an eruption killed 250 head of livestock and forced locals in the surrounding area to flee. There were further evacuations in August 2007 caused by lava flow, after which two people went missing. The most recent eruption came in November 2008. 'This place is something you don't see every day,' said Karel. 'As a photographer, I get to see amazing places and when you see that people like those photos. This is kind of a reward in itself.'", "candidates": [["The world's oldest continuously active volcano, Erta Ale, has been captured on camera by Czech photographer Karel Tupy.

The FA will announce that both Team GB football sides have been scrapped. Meanwhile, FA chairman Greg Dyke's demand for radical changes in top-flight clubs' 25-man squads to ensure young English players get more game time has irritated the Premier League.", "article": "England proposals for men\u2019s Team GB football at the Rio Olympics have already been kicked into the long grass by the other home nations \u2014 and the women\u2019s hopes are going in the same direction. There were strong hopes that a women\u2019s team could still represent GB in Brazil in 2016 when the strength of the opposition for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland soon made it obvious that the men\u2019s initiative was a non-starter. Team GB are unlikely to reform for 2016 Olympics after coming together for London 2012. But the Celtic countries, having been promised that the two football sides at London 2012 were a one-off, have informed the FA that they see no reason to treat women\u2019s football any differently because it still threatens their independence \u2014 however many times they\u2019re reassured by FIFA that it won\u2019t. The FA will announce imminently that both Team GB football sides have been scrapped. Such are football\u2019s sensitive politics that after FIFA president Sepp Blatter had praised UEFA\u2019s work in his opening speech at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, the president of the European body, Michel Platini, left out his one dig at Blatter contained in advance copies of his speech. Michel Platini (right) seemed to bite his lip during his speech about Sepp Blatter's FIFA at the UEFA Congress. Platini, in an obvious nod to Blatter\u2019s regular references to steering the world football ship, was due to say: \u2018I regard myself as a simple team-mate, at most your captain. But not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm, clinging to the helm for dear life.\u2019 But he skipped the bit about \u2018clinging to the helm for dear life\u2019. Nothing sums up Blatter\u2019s presidential election trickery more than the decision to have a special meeting in Zurich to decide future numbers of World Cup places \u2014 the day after the Congress vote in May. This will allow Blatter at least to make promises about more World Cup places to the confederations who support him. FIFA say the issue has to be debated afterwards as candidate Luis Figo (right) has increasing World Cup participation as part of his manifesto. England return to Dublin for a friendly against Ireland after riots saw the last game abandoned in 1995. There is confidence England\u2019s powderkeg friendly against the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium on June 7 \u2014 the first time England have played in Dublin since a riot forced the abandonment in 1995 \u2014 will pass without trouble. All the focus in Ireland is on the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Scotland on June 13. No whitewash for Gill. There was no surprise about David Gill being elected British vice-president on the FIFA ExCo at the UEFA Congress on Tuesay. But FA of Wales\u2019 outspoken president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, who has made increasingly outlandish claims about FA skulduggery, received 10 votes out of 54 which is nine more than many expected. Meanwhile, Gill said that rather than ask \u2018awkward\u2019 questions of the Zurich regime which FA chairman Greg Dyke wants him to do, he will be putting \u2018relevant and appropriate\u2019 ones. Luis Figo (left) and the more impressive Michael van Praag are unlikely to oust Blatter as FIFA president. The worry for all three UEFA-endorsed rivals for Blatter\u2019s crown \u2014 Prince Ali of Jordan, Holland\u2019s Michael Van Praag and Portugal\u2019s Luis Figo \u2014 is that the FIFA president still enjoys backing in Europe. Estonia football president Aivar Pohlak claims as many as half of UEFA delegates could back Blatter. That seems unlikely but at least 15 out of 54 countries could. Meanwhile, Van Praag was easily the most impressive of the three challengers when they were given the Congress floor. FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s demand for radical changes in top-flight clubs\u2019 25-man squads to ensure young English players get more game time has irritated the Premier League. Dyke said: \u2018We\u2019re open to discussions and I\u2019d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.\u2019 FA chief Greg Dyke has angered Premier League clubs with his plans for more home-grown players. There could now be tension between Dyke and the PL at the clubs\u2019 summit on Thursday, particularly given Dyke was last week advised not to go public by the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board. But the extent to which Wembley were determined to get maximum publicity for Dyke\u2019s proposals was shown by them bringing in expensive PR firm Milltown Partners to lobby media to attend the press briefing. It was also held at the start of international week so the PL could have no complaints about it deflecting attention from their competition.", "candidates": [["The other home nations, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, have informed the FA that they see no reason to treat women's football any differently because it still threatens their independence.

Fred Nelis, 60, of Holland, got a new heart, while 67-year-old Gordon Veldman of Pentwater, got a new pair of lungs. The operations were held at the exact same time at a Grand Rapids hospital last June. Nelis and Veldman have been close friends for over a decade, however their transplants were completely coincidental. Incredible bond: Gordon Veldman and Fred Nelis have been friends for over a decade, but now consider themselves 'organ brothers' after each received a transplant from the same donor last June, saving their lives. Lifesaving operation: Fred Nelis, 60, underwent a heart transplant after living with\u00a0idiopathic cardiomyopathy for the last 20 years. On-the-mend: Gordon Veldman, 67, received a lung transplant to escape a genetic disease that reduced his lung capacity to 15 percent last year. The medical director of the heart and lung transplant program at Spectrum Health says it was the program's first simultaneous friend-transplant that he's aware of. 'It's pretty wild,'\u00a0Dr. Michael Dickinson told The Grand Rapids Press. 'We thought it was quite a remarkable story when it happened. 'It's nice for us because it kind of shows the growth of the program - that we were able to help both of these two friends right here in West Michigan.' Both men suffered from chronic conditions that caused their health to rapidly deteriorate before their transplants. Nelis has been suffering for 20 years with idiopathic cardiomyopathy - a progressive heart disease with an unknown cause. Then in 2013 he developed atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, and was placed on the heart transplant in March 2014. 'Organ brothers': Godron Veldman (left) and Fred Nelis (right) say they now put their heart and lungs together each time they see each other to show how thankful they are for their transplants. Veldman has a genetic disease called Alpha-1, which would potentially destroy his lungs, and caused him to develop emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One year ago his lung capacity fell to 15 percent, making everyday talks like walking incredibly difficult. 'The end was very near,' he said. 'I probably had two months left.' Then on June 18, 2014, both men received a call - the wait was over. They were both admitted to Spectrum Health and underwent transplants, with Nelis getting a new heart and Veldman new lungs. New lease on life: Fred Nelis was a competitive swimmer for 40 years, before developing heart issues. Both have rebounded since the operations. The men known little about their 32-year-old donor, however were able to send a letter to the man's family through Gift of Life Michigan. Veldman said\u00a0that he and Nelis put their new heart and lungs as close as they can every time they meet. 'We got a gift, and it's best that we treat it as such,' Nelis said.

The attack was so savage that when Mr Steels was discovered, lying in a pool of blood on the footpath, his face had been damaged beyond recognition and there was a gaping hole in the side of his head. Charity worker Phillip Steels (right) was repeatedly bludgeoned to death by Malachi Lindo (left) Psychiatrist Dr Ian Cumming told the court that Lindo was either suffering from drug induced psychosis or paranoid schizophrenia and concluded that Ethylone intensified the symptoms of mental illness. Ethylone is one of dozens of synthetic narcotics that have flooded the UK over the last decade. The most famous, mephedrone or meow meow, was implicated in a series of deaths across the UK which led to the law being changed in 2010 to categorise the drugs as Class B. Lindo said he could not remember the attack but told psychiatrists he believed he could pass through other dimensions. He admitted manslaughter, but an Old Bailey jury took 11 hours and 31 minutes to find Lindo guilty of murder by a majority of ten to one. Lindo showed no emotion as the verdict was read out, but paused briefly to look up at family members in the public gallery as he was taken down. Judge Paul Worsley QC told him: \u2018As you know the sentence must be one of life imprisonment.\u2019 The judge remanded Lindo in custody to be sentenced on Monday. Mr Steels was found lying in a pool of blood on the footpath. He had a large hole in the left side of his head and his face was damaged beyond recognition (collect picture) The Old Bailey heard Lindo and Mr Steels did not know each other before their chance meeting in Green Street, Enfield in London, in the early hours of 4 September 2014. Mr Steels, originally from Sligo, Ireland, was walking home after leaving a friend\u2019s house at 1.30am when Lindo launched his attack. CCTV cameras captured part of the struggle as Mr Steels was knocked to the ground and hit repeatedly. Police were called to the scene at 1.38am after a passing motorist spotted the victim and reported a road traffic accident. Officers also spotted Lindo rolling about in the middle of the road about 50 yards away and ordered him to kneel on the ground before putting him in handcuffs. Lindo shouted: \u2018Take me to heaven, kill me now, I want to die,\u2019 and added \u2018I\u2019m not going to kill anyone else.\u2019 He also asked the police to let him go home, adding: \u2018I promise I won\u2019t kill again.\u2019 Lindo told officers he had taken cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis and added: \u2018I\u2019m a psychopath, I\u2019m a psychic and I\u2019ve got AIDS.\u2019 Mephedrone, a legal high, known as meow meow, white magic, drone, bubble and MCAT, which was legal until April 2010. Blood tests later revealed traces of THC, the active component of cannabis, and Ethylone. Police found skunk cannabis, MDEA and methylenedioxymethylcathinone concealed inside Lynx aerosols and other containers in Lindo\u2019s bag. Prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC told the court Mr Steels\u2019 death was \u2018wholly unnecessary.\u2019 Lindo, of Bowles Green, Enfield, admitted manslaughter but denied murder.\u00a0He was convicted of a single count of murder. Over the past five years there has been an\u00a0unprecedented increase in the number, type and availability of new psychoactive substances in Europe, with 101 new substances reported in 2014 alone. Yesterday, the government banned two groups of dangerous \u2018legal highs\u2019. The stimulant compound drug 4,4\u2019-DMAR, which is linked to the deaths of more than 20 people in the UK, mainly Northern Ireland, and the synthetic opioid MT-45, have both been outlawed as Class A substances. The move is part of a crackdown on new psychoactive substances (NPS) \u2013 known as \u2018legal highs\u2019- and minister have already banned more than 500 new drugs. Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said the action included the creation of the Forensic Early Warning System to identify substances previously unseen in the UK. Tomorrow a UK-led proposal to internationally control the drug mephedrone is expected to be passed by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna.

Nurse JoAnn Loiselle said: 'To see them [Alexandre and Ronaldo] going from tiny and fighting for their lives to thriving with what looks like no deficits is almost a miracle. Dr Jonathan Davis, chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had seen 'exceptionally rare' delivery attempted several times, but that it was never quite successful. He said: 'It's the first time in my career I've seen it this successful. I've seen it attempted a number of times and it was never quite successful, and in this case it made a huge difference.' Alexandre and Ronaldo were to be Pinheiro da Silva's first children with Ronaldo, and she was thrilled to be pregnant with twins. Ronaldo Antunes (above with son Ronaldo), the boys' father, said he is grateful to be celebrating his sons' first year. Lindalva  (pictured with her husband, Ronaldo, and twin babies) was just 24 weeks pregnant when she went into labor. Her twins beat all odds by being born 24 days apart in a rare procedure. But when her water broke in February, the excitement turned to fear. 'I panicked,' Pinheiro da Silva told\u00a0ABC. 'It wasn't time. It was too early. I knew I could lose the babies.' Lindalva gave birth to premature Alexandre, who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, as doctors were able to keep Ronaldo growing inside of his mother's womb during the unique technique. Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are doing well. Pinheiro da Silva has spoken out about the technique doctors resorted to in the hope they could save one twin when the first was born at only 24 weeks after she went into premature labor in February. She gave birth to premature Alexandre, who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, as doctors kept Ronaldo growing inside of his mother's womb during the unique technique. Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are doing well. When potassium sulfate injections failed to stop Pinheiro da Silva's labor, doctors decided to go forward with a rare technique in which one baby is kept in the womb after its twin is born. 'When you have a situation where one baby is born and labor stops, you are given this window of opportunity,' Dr. Steven Ralston, director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the Globe. 'But it's a rare window. Most times, labor does not stop.' Thankfully, after Alexandre was born at just 1 pound, 10 ounces, it did happen. Doctors stopped Pinheiro da Silva's labor and left the delivered child's umbilical cord and placenta inside her womb. Pinheiro da Silva's first twin Alexandre was born at just 24 weeks and weighed only 1 pound 10 ounces. As Alexandre fought for his life, his brother Ronaldo lived on in their mother's womb growing stronger. Ronaldo was born 24 days after his brother and weighed 3 pounds 3 ounces. 'On the. second day after Alexandre was born, his umbilical cord came out,' Pinheiro da Silva told ABC. Her husband Ronaldo'saw it hanging.' 'But they just cleaned it and put it back inside,' she said. Pinheiro da Silva was given antibiotics to combat infection, which can be common. after the procedure.

'It's psychological warfare and after a while it gets to you,' he said of being a member of the polarizing religion. 'Things got so bad that I tried to jump off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2007, trying to kill myself.' He spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident, and that is when he finally left the church. Scroll down for video. The nephew of John Travolta (above with wife Kelly Preston) has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the Church of Scientology. Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave the Church of Scientology (above) after he tried to take his own life, at which point members began mouthing to hi, 'You are dead' Speaking with The National Enquirer, Sam did however say that his famous uncle did everything he could to help him, but even he could not stop the attacks that were waged against him after his decision to leave. 'Planting drugs on me' and'spreading rumors around town that I was psychotic, and even worse - a pedophile,' are just two of the ways Sam claims members of the church tried to bring him down after his decision to leave Scientology. ''My uncle told me, \"Sorry, Sam, I can't help you. They don't care who I am.\"' His uncle does however supply Sam with a monthly allowance, which is greatly appreciated by the struggling screenwriter. Sam also says in the interview that Travolta has never pressured members of his family into joining Scientology, though he does say he would be 'friendlier' to those individuals who were members of the church. The other claim Sam makes against the church, and one that has been brought up frequently by former members, is the amount of work required of members for little to no pay. Sam claims he worked as a file clerk,'making $36 for a 60-hour week.' Then, there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church. Sam, claims they 'would mouth to me, \"You are dead,\" over and over again. It was all about mental control for them.' The 47-year-old says he has moved on now that the attacks have stopped, and he is finally trying to get his life back on track. Sam's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church, with the HBO documentary Going Clear set to premiere later this month. The film takes a look at the religion, and how its treatment of A-list members like Tom Cruise and Travolta, differs from others in the church. It is based on the book of the same name, which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013, and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church.

La Liga would look very different if the goals of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were taken away.

Real Madrid currently enjoy a two-point advantage over their rivals Barcelona in the La Liga standings. How the La Liga table would look if goals by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were taken away (Opta) In real life, Real Madrid currently enjoy a two-point advantage over their Clasico rivals, thanks in no small part to the 30 league goals of Ronaldo this season. But if they and Messi's contribution of 27 goals were subtracted, it's Barcelona who would enjoy a slender one-point advantage at the summit. Opta went through every match this season in which Messi and Ronaldo have scored and took away their goals from the final score. Ronaldo celebrates his goal in Real Madrid's 1-1 home draw with Villarreal at the weekend. The Portuguese was also on target in Real's 2-0 victory at Elche last month. Ronaldo celebrates one of his hat-trick of goals in Real's 3-0 home win over Celta Vigo in December. With Messi, Barcelona would still win all but one of the matches in which he has scored. That is the 3-2 home win over Villarreal last month, which would end in a draw. But taking away Ronaldo's goals affects Real's season more dramatically. The Portuguese scored four in the 5-1 home win over Elche, meaning they would only draw 1-1. Lionel Messi claims the match ball after his hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-1 rout of neighbours Espanyol. Messi's 27 league goals this season have seen him surpass the all-time La Liga scoring record. Messi celebrates with team-mates Pedro and Marc Bartra after scoring in the 5-0 rout of Levante last month. Removing his hat-trick against Celta Vigo would see them claim one point rather than three, and subtracting his goal against Villarreal last weekend means they would lose instead of draw. It does prove to an extent that Real are more reliant on the goals of Ronaldo than Barcelona are on the goals of Messi.

The TSA (Transport Security Administration) has its own Instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing. From passengers travelling with their beloved eels, to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places, the TSA shares it all with its 238,000 followers. Though potentially harmless, this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals, the TSA says. Discovered in a carry-on bag at the Eagle County Regional Airport in Colorado, it's hard to know what this odd-looking creature is. While it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy, TSA agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item. Grenades, whether inactive or otherwise, are prohibited in any carry-on or checked luggage. Another item to leave out of your hand luggage? Seal bombs, like those discovered in a passenger's carry-on bag in Seattle's Tacoma International Airport. A seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas, but, unfortunately, what this traveller didn't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry-on and checked baggage. Seal bombs, used for fishing, are prohibited from both carry-on and checked luggage. One of the oddest items that MailOnline came across while browsing the TSA Instagram was definitely a medieval mace, which was discovered in a carry-on bag at Chicago's Midway International Airport. Similarly dangerous, a pair of cat-shaped brass knuckles were seized at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. While they may look like a key chain at first glance, these feline-inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board. One of the strangest confiscated items? A medieval mace, found at Chicago's Midway International Airport. These cat-shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported. In 2012, officers seized a bag of live eels, which they found in a passenger's checked luggage in Miami. Officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012. Found in a passenger's checked bag at the Miami International Airport, the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to Maracaibo, Venezuela. However, instead of arguing with security, the passenger, smartly, opted to surrender all items to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Seven small snakes were also discovered in Miami in 2011, after being stuffed down a traveller's trousers in nylon stockings. The snakes were found using TSA's Advanced Imaging Technology, which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight. The passenger was later arrested and charged. And yet another animal-based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a Scooby Doo greeting card, despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry-on bags. A Scooby Doo greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife. Also in Miami in 2011, a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes, in nylon stockings, in their trousers. Swords, though fine to check, cannot be brought on board an airplane as a carry-on item. This Jack the Ripper-like sickle was seized from a passenger's bag because no blades are allowed on board.

Warren Gatland\u2019s side need a thumping victory over Italy to overturn their points deficit on England and Ireland and \u2014 despite the Kiwi keeping his counsel about the scenario \u2014 there is understood to be some disappointment about the organisers\u2019 trophy decision. Wales centre\u00a0Jonathan Davies is tackled by Ireland lock Paul O'Connell (left) and tighthead Mike Ross. \u2018I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a trophy somewhere, like a plastic cup or something,\u2019 said Davies. \u2018Obviously people are doubting us and they don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be involved. But we just worry about ourselves, concentrate on ourselves, and will put a performance together that hopefully means we can get the cup on Sunday.\u2019 Welsh hopes of a landslide victory could hinge on the fitness of Italy No 8 Sergio Parisse, who has a \u201830-40 per cent chance\u2019 of being fit. Italy have delayed their team announcement by 24 hours to give him time to recover, but Davies says Wales will not change their approach even if the 31-year-old is ruled out. Scott Williams is congratulated by Davies and Dan Biggar following his crucial try against Ireland. \u2018We can\u2019t fall into that trap,\u2019 said Davies. \u2018If you do, the pressure seems to come on you rather than the opposition. \u2018Italy have some key injuries with the captain maybe being out, and after the disappointment of France, they\u2019ll have doubt in their minds. \u2018It\u2019s about us going out there and stamping our authority. It\u2019s about sealing that doubt and building from there.\u2019 While Italy are struggling for form, Wales are still building momentum after their victory over Ireland. A fine defensive display kept the championship race alive, however Davies knows his side must add more cutting edge in attack. Warren Gatland's side are in a three-horse race for the Six Nations title that will be decided on Saturday. \u2018Looking back on the Ireland game, we probably left two or three scoring opportunities out there,\u2019 said Davies. \u2018This week we\u2019re going to have to take all our chances. \u2018As a back line we haven\u2019t fired as we\u2019d have wanted to. The forwards have worked tirelessly all campaign for us and there\u2019s pressure on the backs now to take opportunities.\u2019 If Wales can rack up the points, the pressure will move on to Ireland and England, who are up second and third against Scotland and France in the afternoon of staggered fixtures. Davies and his countrymen will watch events unfold from Rome and he plans to cheer on his French clubmates from Clermont Auvergne. Italy's captain and talisman\u00a0Sergio Parisse faces a race to fit for the visit of Wales on Saturday. \u2018France can be amazing at times,\u2019 said Davies. \u2018Hopefully, they can turn up and do a job. They\u2019ve done it in the past.\u2019 Aside from two injury-enforced changes in the front row, Gatland has kept faith with the starting XV who beat Ireland. Scott Williams scored the decisive try and the centre was on Wednesday among the latest batch of players \u2014 along with Alun-Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate and Gareth Anscombe \u2014 to sign a dual contract with the WRU and their region. \u2018Alun-Wyn, Dan, Scott and Gareth represent a cross-section of experience.

The beloved dog died days after returning from the Crufts show in Birmingham, sparking an international murder mystery and claims he was'murdered' by a bitter rival. And just as toxicology reports this week showed he had died after ingesting a fast-acting illegal pesticide, residents of his hometown of Lauw, Belgium, have revealed the small village is in the grip of a suspected serial cat killer. Scroll down for video. It was revealed two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran- were to blame for Jagger's death, while residents in his hometown have revealed their fears they are in the grip of a serial cat killer. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Lauw, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. His devastated owner Aleksandra Lauwers, 34, was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone. However, toxicology reports released this week suggested he must have ingested it at his home in Belgium as the poison discovered in his system is notoriously fast-acting. Now locals have claimed ten dead cats have been found in the past two months alone. One resident, Els van Marsenille, claimed she had lost three since January and her neighbour two, according to David Sanderson, reporting for\u00a0The Times. Local Linda Jans said she was now too scared to take her dogs out for walks in the village, claiming a pet killer unhappy about dogs' barking could operate quickly by simply throwing poison out into the streets and parks. Prize-winning Irish Setter Jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of Belgium. Local\u00a0veterinarian Patrick Jans, (unrelated to Ms Jans), said he was waiting on toxicology reports to reveal what killed the local cats, but said there were'symptoms suggestive of intoxication'. Their claims are backed up by the evidence -\u00a0Caroline Kisko, secretary for the Kennel Club which organises Crufts, said this week two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for Jagger's death. 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death. 'We have had confirmation, including from independent toxicologists, that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting. 'Severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours. 'Considering we are told that Jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, late on Friday March 6 night, leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention, we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday March 5, some 28 to 36 hours earlier.' The family's vet Dr Patrick Jans reiterated this - telling the Mail Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died. 'I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it's unlikely because of the long time delay. I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.'

Parents have expressed outrage, with one mother calling the feature 'insulting', and many have taken to social media to express their disappointment at the overtly 'sexist' Lego Friends line.", "article": "Toy giant Lego has come under fire from parents after publishing an article in its own-brand magazine which offered a range of 'insulting' beauty tips to young girls. The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature called 'Emma's Beauty Tips', which suggested that young girls who are'ready to change up their looks' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape. 'You, yes you, are beautiful, but if you're ready to change up your look, read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face,' the article reads. Outrage: This 'beauty tips' feature in the March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine has caused fury among parents. The feature then lists five different face shapes, from 'heart faces' to 'oval faces', suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape. And while those with heart-shaped faces are advised to choose 'long, curly layers and thinned out curls' in order to accentuate their 'angular cheeks', those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to 'have almost any style haircut' because 'almost everything looks great on this face shape'. Unsurprisingly, the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother, Cleveland-based writer Sharon Holbrook, writing a piece for the New York Times slamming the magazine's 'insulting' feature. '[My daughter] is seven,' she wrote. 'My little girl, the shape of her face, and whether her haircut is flattering are none of Lego\u2019s concern,' \u00a0It wasn\u2019t even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it.' Mrs Holbrook goes on to quote from the Lego Friends website, which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are, she writes, 'far too young' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to'soften the edges' of their faces. Unnecessary: The 'overtly girly' Lego Friends line, including this\u00a0Heartlake Hair Salon, has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional Lego models. Calling for change: Writer Sharon Holbrook (pictured) wrote a piece about the Lego feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape. The online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media, with parents across the country calling for Lego to abandon its'sexist' marketing campaigns and 'overtly girly' toy ranges in favor of returning to the 'powerful messages' it once offered to \u00a0young girls who were so eager to play with their products. 'Go back to this [message] of 1981 instead of \"beauty tips for 5-12 year-olds\" c**p,' one person wrote on Twitter, alongside a picture of a 30-year-old Lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to 'build for fun'. Another added: 'Nonononono. Damn it, LEGO. Girls don't need another source of beauty tips, let alone from you.' One parent went as far as to say she would boycott Lego until the brand does something to address its'sexist' campaigns, tweeting: 'Hey @LEGO_Group, your sexism is getting out of control. I\u2019m buying @Tegu blocks until you check it (sic).' 'The ultra-girly Lego Friends line caused a flap from the beginning,\u00a0and I wasn\u2019t at all sure whether I liked it,' Mrs Holbrook added. 'Why can\u2019t girls and boys both play with traditional Legos? When I was little, Lego used to even market them to all children, magnificently so...' Go back: Parents are calling for Lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls, such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981. Fury: Many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly'sexist' Lego Friends line. In a statement provided to Mashable,\u00a0Lego spokesman Michael McNally insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by'readers', adding that the brand'sincerely regrets' any offense caused by the feature. 'Our Club team is always striving for new ways to engage with Lego fans based on insights we gather from our Club audience,' Mr McNally said. 'One particular thing that readers asked us to include was an \"Advice Column\". In the most recent magazine, we attempted to deliver against this request by elaborating on a current Lego Friends story line. 'We sincerely regret any disappointment it may have caused.

Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, struggled with her weight her entire life before she was diagnosed with PCOS in 2000. Six years later she managed to slim down by following a grueling diet and exercise plan - but her restricting regimen wasn't sustainable and she soon began piling the pounds back on, gaining 120lbs. In 2013 however, she underwent lap band surgery to help control her weight, and was soon inspired to start running. 'I was always drawn to that finish-line feeling, but I never thought running was possible for me,' she told Woman's Day. Shocking transformation:\u00a0Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, lost 135lbs after having lap band surgery in 2013. Starting out: Before she lost the weight (L), Michelle joined a running team and began training for her first half marathon. She finished her second New York City Half Marathon this month (R) 'It was difficult and painful when I was heavier,' she recalled. 'But I was so motivated by my friend's story of how exciting her race was. I knew I wanted to try it.' Michelle completed both the 2014 and 2015 New York City Half Marathons, and now she is training to run a whopping 26.2 miles during the New York City Marathon this November. Her training plan, which includes spin classes, bootcamp classes and weight lifting, as well as running, has helped her lose 135lbs. And now that she has slimmed down, Michelle is slowly but surely gaining her confidence back. New woman: Michelle put on 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain (L). \u00a0After her weight loss surgery, she learned how to control her portions (R) Not easy: Even though Michelle struggled to run when she was heavier, she stuck with it. 'I used to hate dating and think I'd have to settle for just anybody, but I don't feel that way anymore,' she said. 'The most important change is I accept myself.' Michelle noted that although she still has excess skin on her arms and legs, she is finally happy with herself. But getting to this point was far from easy for Michelle, who had tried almost everything to control her weight. Before she was diagnosed with PCOS in her senior year of high school, Michelle had rapidly put on pounds and was starting to lose her hair. Big smile: Michelle can be seen snapping an action selfie during her most recent race. More confident: Michelle said she has gained her confidence back after her weightloss transformation. PCOS made her insulin-resistant, so it was nearly impossible for her to lose weight. She was given various medications and shots - including prescription diet pills - but nothing worked. Michelle eventually hired a personal trainer and followed a strict diet plan that was created for her by a nutritionist. She managed to lose 120lbs over the course of a year, but working out two hours per day and living on a diet of only vegetables and protein left her with little to no social life. When the weight slowly crept back onto her frame, she finally considered lap band surgery, which is intended to reduce the quantity of food consumed. The procedure involves an inflatable device being placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch, essentially shrinking stomach capacity. Amazing fete: Michelle posed in a black dress (L) before she lost 115lbs and 42.5 inches off her frame (R) Personal win: Michelle can be seen holding the medal she received after she completed the New York City Half Marathon. Michelle noted that she didn't want people to think she had 'taken the easy way out', but she quickly learned it was a 'tool, not a miracle'. She still had to learn how to control her portions and make healthy choices, while maintaining a regular workout schedule. Michelle proudly showed her fifth grade students her completion medal after she completed her first half marathon.

Earlier this year, the opinionated former Apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight.", "article": "Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot. Overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter Katie Hopkins. The controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight. Writing in her column for Now! magazine, the 39-year-old said: 'The most upsetting thing of all is a fat child. 'Watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle.' The mother-of-three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems: 'I've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent. 'The fat kids go through the school gates and there's the fat mum in the car, who doesn't bother to get out, still wearing her pyjamas...and that really does my head in.' Citing government statistics that say one-in-10 four-year-olds are now overweight, the Celebrity Big Brother star even goes as far to say that, if she had her way, fat children would be'sent to special sports schools until they make the grade.' Hopkins also opines that she thinks people in England are far too soft on 'fat shaming'. 'There's loads of fat kids and we don't say anything because that would be fat-shaming, or bullying...well, I disagree completely. 'In England, we're far too soft on it and we seem to think it's okay that people are pureeing KFC to spoon-feed to their babies.' Earlier this year, the opinionated former Apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight. Katie has form with insulting overweight people. On her television show Making My Fat, she was kicked out of an 800lb woman's house after rows. Now, she's turned her venom to children, saying obese kids should go to'special sports schools' until they make the grade' Katie before her own weight gain (left) and after (right) In the programme, Katie was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape, but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight. She loaded up on junk food every couple of hours, setting herself a target of 5,000 calories every day. Katie's doctor advised her not to go through with the programme, warning the star that she faced a number of health problems including liver strain, damaged knees, altered blood chemistry, and stretched skin among other issues. But she persisted with the\u00a0experiment, going so far as to travel to North Carolina in the US to take part in an eating\u00a0competition. Katie reveals she had to sleep next to a sick bucket  because overeating made her feel so nauseous. At the fast food restaurant, customers are given 20 minutes to consume a monster burger, containing a kilo of meat and 8,000 calories. Katie gave the meal her best shot, but only succeeded in consuming around half. She said: 'There are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds (14.2 stone) and 300 pounds (21 stone) each. 'I can't understand why no one is telling them to stop. 'I feel really sorry for those children. Their parents were just there watching them eat. 'I just want to go and ask them to stop. 'I couldn't do that to my children. I could never feed my children to death.' Katie also visited an American called Nicky, a woman who weighs 803lb (57 stone). Nicky is often confined to her house because of the weight that she carries around. While the women initially got on like a house on fire, Katie quickly insulted Nicky and the women became embroiled in an argument, which saw her asked to leave the house. The TV star was unrepentant, telling the cameras: 'There is no way she is really happy. 'She has managed to become happy with what she has got by accepting it's rubbish. 'I would rather be put down than be Nicky.' Making My Fat followed Katie Hopkins as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise. The end of the programme saw Katie engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight, gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours. Katie Hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the UK - she recently came second in a poll of the world's most hated people.

{"abstract": "The Kentucky GOP has decided to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary, which would allow Rand Paul to run for two offices in 2016. The plan would allow Paul to get around a Kentucky law that prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot twice. The final vote would come in August when a larger gathering of the Kentucky GOP is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force.", "article": "(CNN)Rand Paul's goal to run for two offices in 2016 cleared a hurdle Saturday after the Kentucky GOP decided to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary. The plan allows the first-term U.S. senator, who's running for re-election and making a likely bid for president, to get around a Kentucky law that prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot twice. Rand Paul searches for green light on caucus proposal. After Paul met with the party's 54-member executive committee in Bowling Green for a two-hour session, the group voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee that would decide the rules and regulations of how a caucus would be held. The final vote would come in August when a larger gathering of the Kentucky GOP is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force. \"We thank the members of RPK for their unanimous support and look forward to continuing this process,\" said Paul's top adviser, Doug Stafford, in a statement. Kentucky law allows the state party to determine the details of its presidential preference vote, but not the primary for other elected offices in the state. In other words, Paul's name for his Senate re-election bid would still remain on the May 2016 primary ballot, but the presidential vote would likely move up earlier in the year to March. The senator appeared at the meeting to address some concerns about a caucus, namely the increased cost, as well as the lower voter turnout typically associated with caucuses. He has pledged to raise money through his donor network to help offset the costs, and proponents of the caucus argue that the significant media attention expected and Kentucky's earlier placement in the nominating calendar would spur just as much turnout. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, issued a scathing statement Saturday, saying a Republican caucus next year \"could create potential chaos in our electoral process\" and promised to \"monitor the situation\" in the coming months. \"In the meantime, I call on the Republican Party of Kentucky to provide details on how all their voters would be able to participate and how the party intends to uphold the integrity of the process,\" she said.", "candidates": [["The Kentucky Republican Party has voted to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary, allowing Rand Paul to run for two offices in 2016.

{"abstract": "Former England rugby player, Will Greenwood, criticizes Ian Ritchie, the Rugby Football Union's CEO, for stating that finishing second in the Six Nations is \"not acceptable\". Greenwood believes that Ritchie's statement undermines the progress made by head coach, Stuart Lancaster, and the team, and that it is wrong to say such things in public. He argues that England are in a good position for the upcoming World Cup and need to be united as a team to have a chance of winning.", "article": "I just cannot understand why Ian Ritchie has made such a statement. The first thing that surprises me is the timing, following one of the most exciting days ever in Five and Six Nations history. England\u2019s victory over France was brilliant to watch, even if they did fall just short of winning the title. Twickenham was rocking and it was an amazing advert for the game ahead of a home World Cup. I\u2019m in Switzerland at present and on the flight the pilot, air stewardesses and all the passengers were talking about Saturday and their real optimism for the World Cup. So for Ritchie to say finishing second is unacceptable just flattens the mood. It doesn\u2019t seem right and is a massive own goal. Stuart Lancaster (second left) consoles his players  after falling six points short of a Six Nations title. England captain Chris Robshaw (left) and his team-mates came second for the fourth year in succession. Ben Youngs celebrate his try during England's storming 55-35 Six Nations victory against France. More importantly, his words undermine Stuart Lancaster. I would go as far as to say he has belittled much of the progress that Lancaster and the team have achieved. If this had happened to me, I would be in Ritchie\u2019s office demanding an explanation. This is professional sport and being a head coach is a tough position. The moment someone says something, the opposition see a chink, a weakness, and try to drive a wedge through it. It\u2019s one thing to say these things in private, as professional sport is about winning, but to say them in public is wrong. If Lancaster has called the result unacceptable, fair enough, but Ritchie has no qualifications to talk about the team\u2019s performance. This year is all about preparing for the World Cup and England put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style. The atmosphere at Twickenham for England's final Six Nations match was electric from start to finish. This was the time for a pat on the back and a united front. Ian Ritchie appointed Stuart Lancaster after an interim period, which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches. He appointed an inexperienced coach in Lancaster yet later awarded him a six-year contract. If the priority was short-term gains, he should have been given a one-year contract. Coming in with no international coaching experience, Lancaster has done a very good job. Wales and Ireland are very strong teams too so to think you can just win Grand Slams and championships is very naive and just brings back the tag that the English are arrogant. Ian Ritchie (right) should be backing Lancaster ahead of the eagerly-anticipated World Cup in September. I\u2019m sure Ritchie had good intentions, perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss. But he will regret what he said as England are in a very good position. If England are going to win the World Cup, they have to have everybody together as one team, everybody\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys.

The first known works by one of Britain's finest composers, Sir Hubert Parry, who wrote the music for Jerusalem, are being sold at auction. The 70 documents, expected to fetch up to \u00a350,000, represent Parry's earliest surviving work and include pieces written when he was an Eton schoolboy and at Oxford. Many of the pieces have never been played in public, but a premiere before the Prince of Wales, a champion of Parry's music, is to take place in May. Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance. As well as Jersualem, he wrote many famous settings for English hymns, including Repton, a well-known tune for Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind. Parry's setting of the anthem I Was Glad has been played at the Coronations of every Monarch since Edward VII and was performed at the Westminster Abbey wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. In a BBC4 documentary about Parry's music, Charles said: 'It gives you tingles up the spine and tears in your eyes.' Parry's version of The Magnificat And Nunc Dimittis In D, and an anthem entitled O Sing Unto The Lord, are considered the best of the cache and will be sung for the first time by the choir at Gloucester Cathedral. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19. It is an appropriate venue because Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848-1918) grew up just two miles from Gloucester, where he learned to play the organ. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19. Adrian Partington, the cathedral's director of music, who examined all the manuscripts and chose the two pieces for the premiere, said: 'The pieces are beautifully well-written for his age and show a talented young composer, but they are not exceptional. I think he was writing stuff for his chums to perform at Eton and Oxford and he did it in a hurry. 'They were probably only performed informally around the piano and I suspect he just forgot about them, which is why they have been gathering dust for all these years. 'But the seeds of a great composition like Jerusalem can be found in this student work. These are beautifully shaped tunes, logical harmony and very exact but imaginative setting of the words.' Some are incomplete or jottings, but there are some important compositions which until recently were kept in storage by one of Parry's distant relatives. In later life, Parry went on to teach and later run the Royal College of Music in London, which has an archive of his work. Dr Peter Horton, a librarian at the college, said: 'The new documents are interesting because they are his early works and one can see from them how Parry's work developed.'", "candidates": [["70 documents by Sir Hubert Parry, one of Britain's finest composers and architect of the English Musical Renaissance, are being sold at auction for up to \u00a350,000.

Messages from the first Brit to be killed fighting ISIS have revealed frustration at the Kurds' lack of discipline - and his fear the 'Corps' would tell his mother he had gone to Syria. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, who died while fighting against the terror group with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG), kept his friends updated through Facebook after heading to war-torn Syria in December. The former Royal Marine's posts and messages give a glimpse of day-to-day life for those fighting ISIS, advises interested friends on how to join up and reveals the Kurdish fighters lack of discipline, but huge determination. But it seems he was most worried about his mother finding out where he was. The messages, published by The Sun, reveal Mr Scurfield began looking for a way to get out to Syria to join up with the YPG at least a month before he arrived in Syria. He was recruited by the Lions of Rojava, and by November 3 had clear plans in place for reaching their base in Syria. On December 6, using a Facebook account set up under a fake name so his friends could keep in touch, he messages to say he has arrived safely in Syria, and met up with two other foreign fighters. But his parents still apparently had no idea where he was - with Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, revealing on December 15: 'I've heard about the authorities threatening to tell my parents!' It is thought the 25-year-old told his friends he was going to do humanitarian work in the war-torn country last year after being 'horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS'. It is unclear what Mr Scurfield told his parents,  archaeologists Chris and Vicci. Mr Scurfield (pictured kneeling, centre) revealed foreign fighters frustration with the Kurds lack of discipline, but also recorded how impressed he was with their attitude. Eventually, it seems the Royal Marines did take matters into their own hands, informing his parents sometime between Christmas and January 5. In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine,\u00a0revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.' The messages and posts also give an idea of what foreign fighters heading for Syria to fight with the YPG can expect. Mr Scurfield revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds''skills and drills'. But Mr Scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the Kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting. 'The Kurds don't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol,' he wrote. Tributes: Fellow-fighters said Mr Scurfield (pictured) 'gave his life combating terrorism for his nation' Warrior: Fellow fighters in Mr Scurfield's 'Lions of Rojava' group have posted tributes to him online. Mr Scurfield's messages also reveal he was waiting for fighting to intensify once more, which would happen in February and March, after the winter came to an end. But then there is silence from the former soldier, and nothing more is thought to have been heard by friends, who were told this week he died on Monday\u00a0was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli.

Lisa Blake, 41, spent six years and \u00a37,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner Stephen, 37, both suffer from unexplained fertility problems. After a fourth round of IVF failed, the couple, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor. Seeing how desperate they were to become parents, Miss Blake's younger sister, Julie Wealand, 35, offered to donate her own eggs. And finally, in December 2013, Miss Blake became pregnant. She gave birth to healthy twin baby boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 months, in July last year. Lisa Blake, 41, gave birth to healthy twin boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 month, in July 2014. Miss Blake said: 'I was so happy to discover that I was finally pregnant. 'Julie has given me the best gift I could ask for, I'll be forever grateful.' The couple's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby. Miss Blake, who has been in a relationship with Stephen for 15 years, said: 'We started trying for baby when I was 34, but after two years we realised something was wrong. 'Doctors couldn't explain my fertility problems - I just couldn't get pregnant. My sister had also struggled to conceive so I knew my age wasn't to blame. 'Growing up, I always dreamed of having at least two children, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be a mum. 'My friends have kids, most from when they were younger, so I only had to attend one baby shower. But when I saw people with children, I wished it would be me.' Aged 36, she turned to IVF treatment in an attempt to conceive. But three agonising years and three failed IVF attempts later, the pair were still childless. Meanwhile her sister Mrs Wealand, who lives in California with her husband, gave birth to two children of her own, conceived through IVF treatment. Miss Blake said: 'I was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant. Even though she lives abroad, we're really close and I loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew. 'But I still longed for a child so Stephen and I pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of IVF. 'Adopting would have been our final chance for children because we couldn't afford to pay for more treatments.' Miss Blake (right) had been trying to conceive for six years, and had spent \u00a37,000 on IVF treatment. She was only able to have children when her sister, Julie Wealand, 35, (left), donated her eggs. Miss Blake became pregnant in December 2013, and gave birth to twins Joshua and Harrison in July 2014. She said her sister had given her 'the best gift she could have ever asked for' But the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs. Miss Blake said: 'At first we were devastated - they didn't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew, who would be willing to donate their eggs. 'We went to my parent's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said. 'She promptly replied \"You can use mine\". 'I was in disbelief and giddy with excitement.' After Mrs Wealand's generous offer, they began the long process of tests and counselling. Her eggs were harvested and fertilised with Stephen's sperm. A year later, Miss Blake was implanted with Mrs Wealand's eggs, but sadly, it was unsuccessful. Miss Blake said: 'I was so disappointed when I discovered that Julie's eggs hadn't worked. 'But despite the emotional toll, I knew I had to just carry on.' So later that year in December 2013, they tried for the final time, using Miss Wealand's embryos they'd frozen from the fourth try. Miss Blake, pictured with partner Stephen, 37, and her newborn babies, gave birth by Caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia. Miss Blake and her partner said they were 'overjoyed' when they discovered they were having twins, who, eight months later, are thriving. She will now celebrate Mother's day with her sons. She said: 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood' Miss Blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins. She said: 'I'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests, which were all negative, while trying to conceive from IVF, so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal. 'During a hospital scan, we discovered we were having twins, I was even more overjoyed.'

Premier League leaders Chelsea have dropped an average of just 8.6 points per season during the last 10 years. If the Blues replicate the form they have shown in their last 10 games during previous seasons then Manchester City will not be able to retain the league title even if they claim nine consecutive wins. Chelsea look set to win the 2014-15 Premier League title as the Blues tend to finish the season off in fine form. Chelsea dropped two points against Southampton at the weekend but are still odds-on favourites to win the title. Jose Mourinho insists Arsenal have joined Chelsea and Manchester City in the Premier League title race. 2013-14: 11 points dropped. 12-13: 7. 11-12: 15. 10-11: 10. 09-10: 5. 08-09: 6. 07-08: 10. 06-07: 11. 05-06: 6. Average: 8.6 points dropped. Chelsea are seven points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand of both their title rivals. Arsenal are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, having played a game less than the Gunners. However Mourinho said after his side's 1-1 draw with Southampton: \u2018Of course Arsenal are in it. They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea. \u2018Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham? \u2018So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately.' Chelsea would finish the season off with over 85 points (85.4 to be exact) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season. The maximum amount of points Manchester City can ascertain is 85 and that would mean Manuel Pellegrini's side defeating the likes of Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton. Arsenal, on the other hand, will be on 84 points if they win their remaining nine fixtures of the campaign. So it appears Mourinho's statement on Arsenal's title credentials may have just been a ploy to ease the pressure on his players following their draw against Southampton.

{"abstract": "Senator Harry Reid's announcement that he will not seek re-election next year has left a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats. New York's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, is expected to succeed him, but left-leaning activists are scrambling to block his rise, calling for Senator Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post instead. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight, with more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers and a long-term work in progress political climb.", "article": "(CNN)Sen. Harry's Reid's perfunctory announcement on Friday that he won't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats -- was followed, hours later, by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with The Washington Post: \"I think Schumer should be able to succeed me.\" That would usher in a whirlwind of activity on Capitol Hill in the next year as New York's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond. Left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block Chuck Schumer's rise. The progressive organization Democracy for America is calling for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post, and the left-leaning Daily Kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing Schumer as too close to the \"Wall Street wing\" of the Democratic Party. With more than a year to go before Senate Democrats will choose a new leader, anything can happen. But after watching Schumer in action for more than 20 years, I'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create. With more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers, Schumer has more money than all but one member of the Senate -- and is the only Democrat in the top 10 in that category. He ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while Democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012, the field looks far more promising for them in 2016: Republicans must defend 24 seats, while Democrats need to protect only 10. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight. Even among the 100-member Senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- Schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime lion of the Senate, once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the Capitol is between Schumer and a television camera. The joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life. Schumer is attuned to television and radio (growing up in the world's media capital will do that). In fact, he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on Sunday, a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the Monday newspapers. But he is also a consummate street politician: At 64, he maintains a habit of biking around New York City neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage, quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade. When a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of New York state, Schumer did her one better, and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in. (He visits every county in the state every year.) Schumer isn't the only politically ambitious kid from Brooklyn -- before attending Harvard, he graduated from a public school, James Madison High, whose alumni include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota (a childhood pal of Schumer's). But Schumer's political climb been a long-term work in progress. He emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a law that banned assault weapons; in the run-up to the final vote, New Yorkers practically couldn't turn on television without seeing Schumer, then a congressman, on the floor of the House, waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban. The higher profile served him well a few years later, when Schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. As a senator on the rise, Schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor. A very partial list of those includes Howard Wolfson, Phil Singer and Blake Zeff, who went on to help run Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign; Ben Lawsky, who is now shaking up the world of finance as New York's top banking regulator; Preet Bharara, who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a U.S. attorney; and Rodney Capel, who is executive director of the state's Democratic Party. With allies, money and the blessing of Reid, Schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book, \"Positively American,\" which lays out a vision for how Democrats should lead America. Like Schumer himself, the book is savvy, hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters.

From the edge of the box, he flicked the ball to create some space and curled it into the top corner. A ssecond followed on six minutes when Harry Wilson's flick set Smith clear out wide.

{"abstract": "Australian 100m hurdler Sally Pearson believes that athletes should receive financial compensation for taking part in the Olympics, as they are entertainers who provide the spectacle that draws in billions of viewers. Currently, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) only awards gold, silver and bronze medals and a bouquet of flowers to athletes, but no financial remuneration. Pearson acknowledges that athletes will still turn up whether they are paid or not, but believes that the times have changed and it is time to at least discuss the issue of Olympic prize money.", "article": "(CNN)Entertainers are paid for entertaining and it's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the Olympics, says 100m hurdler Sally Pearson. In 2014,while the winner of Wimbledon received $2,600,000 and the Augusta Masters champion picked up $1,620,000, when Pearson won gold in the Olympics three years ago she received zero prize money. \"People come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them, we are entertainers\" the Australian, who set an Olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012, told CNN anchor Alex Thomas. \"Entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage, and that's exactly what we're doing in a sporting sense.\" Billions might have tuned in to watch London's 2012 Olympic Games which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory, but the International Olympic Committee's current policy is to (IOC) hand out gold, silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes, but no financial remuneration. \"I can see why they don't, and I'm sure they want to keep it like that, they want to keep it pure,\" added Pearson. \"To be honest we're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not. But the Games wouldn't happen without the athletes.\" It also wouldn't happen without sponsors. The IOC has just signed a new eight-year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant Toyota -- reportedly worth just under $1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals, government support, grants and part-time work. In 2012 only half of American track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $15,000 a year from their sport. The fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history, Pearson told the Australia's Daily Telegraph in 2013 how a year after her Olympic gold medal in London she still wasn't attracting enough sponsors. No stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship. While she has some support from Qantas, AMP and Adidas, appearance fees and prize money in the Diamond League -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28-year-old. Now targeting more medal success at the  2016 Rio Olympics, Pearson achieved a resounding win at the Queensland Track Classic on March 7 with a time of 12.74s.

Marie Delanote, 34, didn't suspect a thing when her fourth child, Eloise, came into this world in May, 2012. In fact, she thought that she had soiled herself.

So she knew that when her waters broke just after 23 weeks of pregnancy that something was very wrong. She said: \u2018I didn't expect it to be an early birth at all because my three other pregnancies were all full term. 'I had been quite ill just a couple of weeks before, I had a very bad throat infection around 21 weeks pregnant, which turned into streptococcus A. \u2018Then ten days later I lost my mucus plug and I started wobbling \u2013 just three days later, my waters broke.\u2019 Eloise in Neonatal Intensive Care at Portsmouth Hospital.

Eloise weighed just 1lb when she was born. Once there, Marie had just two days to settle in before the shock birth occurred. She said: \u2018I thought I had to go to the toilet - I thought I had been blocked for several days but unconsciously had not been wanting to let go because of the baby. \u2018As I went into the bathroom, I thought I had defecated, but there was a mirror in front of the toilet and as I looked up, I saw this tiny little head between my legs, so I knew what was happening. \u2018I pulled the emergency cord and within seconds, the midwives and the neonatal intensive care unit were there. \u2018Two of the midwives supported me while the third one helped to deliver Eloise. \u2018I didn't feel anything because she was so small. \u2018She was as big as my hand, she fitted on my hand - she was really, really small. \u2018Luckily I was in hospital because she was given to the doctors within seconds and they put breathing tubes in her.\u2019 But being born so premature wasn\u2019t the only battle facing Eloise, she had also severely ill after picking up streptococcus A and B from her mother. Marie said: \u2018She was infected by the streptococcus A and B, because in the meantime I had also developed streptococcus B. \u2018So, as she came out and we weren't prepared, she picked that up too. \u2018She was pus-covered, she was smelly, she made no attempts to breathe and she also had two small bleeds in her brain - it didn't look very positive.\u2019 Marie practised reiki and psychic surgery on her daughter alongside traditional medicines given by the NHS. But while the future looked bleak for her daughter, Marie, who works as a spiritual healer, says that as she was put back into her hospital bed and her baby was rushed to the intensive care unit, she was possessed by total calm. She said: \u2018I had this spiritual calm come over me, knowing that I had to do the healing I've learnt and that all would be well. \u2018The comments from the doctor weren't good because that's how the situation was, but I refused to have any negative dust in my mind.\u2019 As the doctors used their traditional medicine on Eloise, Marie supplemented it with Reiki and what she called \u2018psychic surgery\u2019.

A conwoman who used her job working at a care home to steal \u00a3116,000 from the families of vulnerable residents used it to pay for a lifestyle she could not afford. Anne Dobson, 39, splashed \u00a320,000 on a wedding ceremony, another \u00a34,000 on the honeymoon, and bought herself a new car worth \u00a316,000. She tricked the families of three residents of\u00a0Broomfield Grange Care Home, Essex, into paying their monthly bill of around \u00a31,200 directly into her bank account. She then passed the money on to her employer Embrace All Care Homes, but not before taking \u00a3400 from each bill for herself. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that she began taking the funds in order to pay down debts she had racked up, but soon went on a spending spree than included a \u00a31,000 holiday. Andrew Jackson, QC, prosecuting, said: 'In 2013 she was marrying again and needed to pay for her wedding and she could not afford the sort of wedding she wanted so continued to defraud the company. 'She paid for her own wedding which she told police had cost about \u00a320,000 and on top of that a honeymoon to the tune of \u00a34,000, all of which were funded by the ongoing fraud. 'By 2013 she was on top of her debts and she freely admitted that it was to pay for the wedding.' The'simple' scheme worked like clockwork each month, the court was told, until one of the residents' families thought to question the amounts being paid. When interviewed by police, Dobson admitted her actions, telling officers she felt 'crap' for what she had done. At one stage the mum from Witham, Essex, even wrote a \u00a37,000 cheque to one resident in a bid to relieve her of her burden of guilt. Mr Jackson added: 'It was a gross breach of the trust that the company placed in her. 'She played a leading role - she was the author of this fraud - there was an abuse of her position of trust and responsibility.' Miss Penny Summers, mitigating, said Dobson was 'absolutely and thoroughly ashamed of herself' and had yet to tell her children of her actions. She said: 'In the beginning, she was in financial difficulties - however she explained to me that there was no excuse for it ongoing. Dobson (right) gave her personal bank details to three families, collected their monthly bills, skimmed \u00a3800 off for herself, then paid the rest to her employer. She then spent some of the money on a \u00a320,000 wedding. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Dobson also paid \u00a34,000 for a honeymoon, \u00a316,000 for a car, and another \u00a31,000 on a holiday. She also used the money to pay off debts. 'The money was used to pay for her wedding and honeymoon.' Dobson, who wore a black jacket and scarf, black skirt and knee-high black boots, sat with her head bowed in the dock listening to the evidence. She sobbed as she was sentenced. Sentencing her to\u00a0two years and four months in jail, Recorder Mark Ockelton, told her: 'You were not in debt at the time - it was committed in order to give you a lifestyle of the sort you thought you ought to have. '\u00a320,000 on a wedding, another \u00a34,000 on a honeymoon, then you bought a new car for \u00a316,000 and spent \u00a31,300 on holiday and that still leaves tens of thousands of pounds unaccounted for.' A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later this year in order to try to recoup some of the missing money. Dobson had joined the Embrace care company as a receptionist before being promoted to the role of administrator - a role which gave her access to residents personal files. Mr Jackson said: 'It became plain that she has been syphoning considerable amounts of money. 'Her role was to update the company head office with regards to what residents or patients would be paying for care - that amounts having been agree with the residents and the care home. 'Once the fee for the care has been agreed, what should happened, by direct debit or standing order, the resident would pay weekly or monthly the required amount direct to the care home.'

It sounds like Game Of Thrones. But as the camera sweeps across the map, it soon becomes clear that this short film has re-imagined the TV fantasy series to deliver a very modern political message. Titled Game Of Cuts (Winter Is Coming For Councils), it was produced by a campaign group which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England. The production, which cost \u00a311,000, cleverly echoes the drama played out in the hit HBO show. Game Of Thrones spoof Game Of Cuts was produced by campaign group Sigoma, which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England. Made by Sigoma (Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities), it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions cannot fund vital services, while other areas moan about not having luxuries. In the opening scene are characters based on those from the House of Lannister - a rich and powerful dynasty in the south. Among them is a parody of King Joffrey Baratheon, a ruthless ruler, who is informed: 'The seven kingdoms prosper once more. 'We must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north... Our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms.' Honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark) is seen right, in the foreground. He says to the evil King Joffrey of the south (left: 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them' In the film, Queen Cersei is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son Joffrey. Enter honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark): 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them.' 'Our children have no places to read and our roads are crumbling.' But at every turn, Starp's entreaties are scoffed at. To join Sigoma, council must pay an initial fee of \u00a33,000. However, the film has been criticised by Conservative party vice-chairman and former local government minister Bob Neill. He said: 'Taxpayers' money shouldn't be used to subsidise the Box Set fantasies of town hall officials. At the end of the short film, the king fires an arrow at Lord Starp, whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at. According to Sigoma, by March 2016, the amount of funding cuts for regions will be:. 'It's a complete waste of money, but also a complete fiction. It's missing the key plot - there's a black hole in the Kingdom's coffers, thanks to the bad old days of King Gordon. 'His hand of the king, Baron Red Ed, may now eye the throne, but he would wind the clock back to same failed old policies of government waste and higher taxes, meaning less money to go around for local services.' Meanwhile,\u00a0Labour councillor Sir Steve Houghton, chairman of Sigoma said: 'Whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt, the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required. 'Clearly a situation in which some councils are struggling to provide essential services such as care and support for their most vulnerable residents, whilst others have more than enough, is clearly unfair and unsustainable,' he told the Express And Star. He added that the reason the video was made was because national politicians were not listening. According to Sigoma, since 2010, local government in England has lost more than 40 per cent of its core funding. It also said that urban authorities, largely in the North and the Midlands, have lost the most money as a result of these cuts.

The family of a young woman who killed herself days before going on trial for 'inventing a rape claim' are calling for lessons to be learned. Eleanor de Freitas, 23, from Fulham, west London, received a private prosecution summons for perverting the course of justice, funded by a man accused of drugging and raping her. But the former Durham University student died on April 4 last year - three days before the trial was due to start at Southwark Crown Court in London. Her family said they were 'astonished' the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to take bipolar sufferer Miss de Freitas to court. She made a rape allegation to Metropolitan Police in January 2013 against wealthy financier, Alexander Economou, 35, claiming the incident had happened just before Christmas 2012. It was investigated but officers closed the case after concluding that gaps in the evidence meant they would not be able to secure a conviction. Despite being told he would not face charges, Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of them together. He then started a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. The whole process is said to have cost him \u00a3200,000. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out, leaving her frightened and devastated. The inquest into her death was originally opened in November last year, but was adjourned so the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders could personally investigate the CPS's decision to prosecute. West London coroner Chinyere Inyama also said he needed to know the remit of the CPS investigation before deciding on the scope of his hearing. Ahead of the resumption tomorrow, her father David de Freitas said: 'The most important thing for us is that lessons are learnt from the tragic death of our daughter. 'We hope that the inquest will explore the important public interest issues regarding prosecutions of rape complainants and the appropriate protections and care that should be put in place for vulnerable people like Eleanor. Her father\u00a0David de Freitas (left) said that lessons need to be learnt from her 'tragic death'. She had accused Alexander Economou (right) of raping her but the allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence. 'In view of the importance of this case and its tragic consequences, we need to make sure that existing guidelines and practices were adhered to and that any shortcomings in these guidelines and practices are identified and remedied so that no other vulnerable young women and their families have to suffer as we and Eleanor did.' Lawyers for the family said they are hoping the inquest will explore the impact the case had on Miss de Freitas taking her own life and the wider public interest of prosecuting rape complainants for perverting the course of justice. Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the family, said: 'This inquest offers an important opportunity to ensure that lessons are learnt from this needless death and so as to ensure that similar tragic outcomes are avoided in the future.' Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of him and Miss de Freitas (pictured) together. The former Durham University student had bipolar disorder. The inquest into her death will resume tomorrow. Deborah Coles, co-director of support charity Inquest, said: 'This case raises important issues of public importance regarding the treatment of rape complainants. In addition to the specific vulnerabilities of this particular group, Eleanor suffered from a diagnosed serious mental illness. 'There must now be a robust and thorough inquest in order to appropriately consider whether Eleanor received adequate support under the care of West London Mental Health Care Trust and to what extent the prosecution of Eleanor impacted on her life.' The hearing is expected to be completed tomorrow. Eleanor de Freitas claimed she was raped by Alexander Economou just before Christmas 2012. But she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until January 4 last year. Detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution. Officers informed Miss de Freitas on February 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges. But wanting to clear his name, Mr Economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. She received a court summons on August 13 last year. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case, giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it.

{"abstract": "In 1983, a group of teenage computer enthusiasts in Milwaukee, known as the \"4-1-4s,\" were visited by the FBI after hacking into computer systems across the US. The group had been exploring computer systems, but not causing any harm.

One member of the group, who is now a network engineer, reflects on the experience more than 30 years later.", "article": "(CNN)I can't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government, but I will never forget the morning in 1983 when two FBI agents showed up on my parents' doorstep. I had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer, which was pretty common for me back then, at age 18. A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business. I had a slight fear this day would come, because only a couple of days earlier, I had a strange call from a friend asking me what I would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team. Two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the FBI. They said they needed to talk to me. Let me start with a little history: I got my first taste of computers in the mid-1970s in junior high school. We had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached. We were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing. I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out. The teacher dialed into the central office computer, logged in and started the math program. I felt like a new world opened for me. For the first time in my life, I saw something that made me imagine what I wanted to do when I grew up. That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school. There, I learned of an Explorer Scout group sponsored by IBM. For the next couple of years I built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others. We would play with computers at school, in Explorer Scouts, in stores like Radio Shack and at home. Finally in 1982, I bought my first computer. Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own. I purchased a Heathkit H-89, which we built in a friend's basement. At the same time I also bought a Hayes 309 baud Smartmodem. I used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems, or BBS, and create more friendships and acquaintances. We were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked. We ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to a major international bank system in Los Angeles to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of only two U.S. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research. We were really just looking around and playing games on these systems; we didn't want to harm anything. This was pretty easy because computers back then were built with a basic set of login information, all of it written in the manuals. We didn't see any harm in it. We would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and, when we got together for Explorers, we'd talk about exploring, not harming systems. At some point, we started calling our group the \"4-1-4s,\" a name we came up with after hanging out at a local park. We noticed etchings on the tables with numbers like 1-9 and 2-7, gang signatures that came from the streets where they operated. Since we all lived in the Milwaukee area, we more or less jokingly gave ourselves the gang name of 414s for the Milwaukee area code. As the months went on, we started to notice issues staying connected with our modems for any length of time. Then, the FBI showed up at my home. Remember, back then home computers were very new, so there were no computer hacking laws. After about a year of back and forth with the FBI, three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls, which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $500 fine each. As I sat before the judge with my lawyer, he asked why he should not give me prison time. I had recently met the love of my life and we were expecting our first child. So I explained that I would like to be around to see the birth of my baby and live a happy and normal family life. The judge agreed to a plea deal with a stipulation that I could not own a modem during the time I remained on probation. Under the deal, we were charged with misdemeanors that carried two years' probation and a $500 fine. Our records would be expunged under the federal youth corrections act. Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers.

'And I like the smell of Bacon,' she states, as she leans in to sniff the Footloose actor, just as her husband walks in. The meta advert \u2013 at one point the actress says 'you sound like a commercial' \u2013 has been wildly praised for its tongue-in-cheek approach to eggs. The American Egg Board said it's the first time the group is using a Hollywood celebrity in a major marketing push. But which bacon are they talking about here? The ad is full of funny moments like this. The online campaign is supported by print advertisements which also reference the star's last name. The campaign comes at an opportune moment; eggs which were long shunned and viewed as high-cholesterol are now back in vogue in the fickle world of food fashion due to their high protein content. Bob Krouse, CEO of Midwest Poultry Services, an egg producer in Mentone, Indiana, said  that he's glad the egg board is taking a slightly edgier approach in its marketing. Mr Krouse said: 'I always felt like egg farmers were too conservative.' The 'Wake Up To Eggs With Bacon' push by the ad agency Grey is an update on the 'Wake Up To Eggs' campaign that launched in 2012. 'With a last name like Bacon, I'm the obvious choice, and I'm excited to be a part of the new Incredible Edible Egg campaign,' the actor said. 'I like the creativity behind the idea, and I've always been a big fan of eggs.' The egg and Bacon pairing has been received with delight byTwittersphere. The Project TV made a joke of its own: 'There is now officially only one degree of separation between Kevin Bacon and eggs.' User @diannenice said: 'Is there nothing @KevinBacon can't do?

John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst approached him just before midnight on Friday. Robert Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with his loaded.38-caliber revolver in his pocket, claims a nightclub doorman. 'I asked him to come into the club, but he said in a female-ish soft voice, \"I would like to come in, but I can't right now,\"'\u00a0Phillips told the New York Post. Durst, 71, then\u00a0pulled open his brown-tweed suit jacket to reveal the butt of the gun in a belt holster, Phillips said. 'I thought to myself, I hope this old guy with a gun doesn't do anything stupid.' Phillips said that 'the whole exchange took less than a minute' outside the club and Durst 'just stumbled a little as he walked down the block.' 'I just thought he was an old man who was a little bit off. I kept thinking this old guy is on too much prescription medication.' Durst, 71, was arrested on the eve of Sunday's final episode of 'The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst,' and he agreed on Monday to face trial for the murder of Susan Berman, who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished. The final episode ended with the whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom. 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of water running can be heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon. The whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge. Now those words could come back to haunt him \u2014 or help him \u2014 as he faces his murder charge. A possible move by prosecutors to introduce the incriminating material from a six-part documentary on his strange life and connection to three killings could backfire as interview footage did in the Michael Jackson molestation trial and the Robert Blake murder case. In both cases, the defense was allowed under the 'doctrine of completeness' to provide segments of interviews that presented their clients favorably without subjecting them to tough cross-examination. 'I submit that Blake didn't have to testify and Michael Jackson didn't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews,' said attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., who represented both men. 'They just got greedy. They were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them.' In the Jackson case, the defense used unaired footage to counter damage done by Living With Michael Jackson, a damning documentary in which Jackson held hands with his accuser and spoke of letting children into his bed. 'I'd slit my wrists before I'd hurt a child,' Jackson said in one outtake shown by the defense, according to Mesereau, who won the performer's acquittal 10 years ago. Michael Jackson's lead defense attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr. said the so-called incriminating material from the Durst documentary could backfire as interview footage did in the Jackson molestation trial in 2005. In the Durst case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001.

He also told radio host John Gambling during an interview on AM 970 THE ANSWER that Obama is ignoring 'enormous amounts of crime' being committed by blacks. Roughly '70 percent' of homicides in New York City are committed by African Americans, Giuliani said. 'There are many, many extremely understandable' reasons for that both historically and environmentally, he added. 'And if an African-American president stood up and said - I hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that Bill Cosby used to say. The kinds of stuff that Imam Pasha says at the Malcolm X Mosque: This is our responsibility,' he said, trailing off into an explanation of Pasha's doctrine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, waves to public during a conference in Berlin, Germany last Saturday. Fresh off his trip abroad, Giuliani contended on Thursday that internationally, America is considered a 'racist state' Imam Izak-EL Mu'eed Pasha is a black, Muslim leader in New York who Giuliani has been friends with more than a decade. I remember Pasha saying to his congregation, if there were less crime in the community, there would be less police in our community, Giuliani recalled. When referencing Cosby, the retired New York politician was referring to allegations that surfaced last year that black actor raped or otherwise sexually assaulted number of former cast-mates and other women throughout the '60s, 70s and 80s. Prior to that 'America's Dad' had earned a reputation for forcefully encouraging African-American teens to clean up their act and make better use of the educational system their ancestors fought to earn access to. In on memorable - and controversial - address Cosby touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism. Now known as 'the Pound Cake speech', Cosby said, 'These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake. 'Then we all run out and are outraged: \"The cops shouldn\u2019t have shot him.\" What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?' Cosby asked. 'I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said, \"If you get caught with it, you\u2019re going to embarrass your mother.\u201d''America's mayor' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late, saying late last month he's not sure, based on the president's upbringing and behavior, that Obama 'loves America.' After several days of spinning, and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation's first black president, Giuliani finally ended the media-frenzy by penning an op-ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the president would speak more highly of American exceptionalism. Striving to avoid another kerfuffle, Giuliani was careful to balance out his criticisms of Obama on AM 970 with a note of goodwill to the president. 'I disagree with Barack Obama on almost everything, but I think Barack Obama's a good family man, and he's a good man.' 'This is the model we need,' he said of the positive example Obama is setting for the African American communities as a father and a husband. Earlier in the interview, Giuliani suggested the savage beating of a 15-year-old girl in a Brooklyn McDonald's on Monday, the shooting of two Ferguson police officers this morning and an incident at a city council meeting involving NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, at which 20 protester heckled him until they were led out by the cops, all occurred because Obama hadn't done more to verbally build up America's police. 'It all starts at the top. It\u2019s the tone that\u2019s set by the President,' Giuliani said on radio station AM 970 THE ANSWER. President Barack Obama, pictured here boarding Air Force One today, should seek to emulate Bill Cosby when it comes to talking about crimes committed by blacks, Giuliani contended, prefacing the statement with his loathe to mention Cosby 'because of what happened afterwards' Giuliani, who just returned stateside following a conference in Germany on 'Tolerance and Equality against Fundamentalism and Misogyny and says he spent a large portion of the fall traveling abroad, contended that internationally, America's police are considered to be 'racist.' 'It is the obligation of the President to explain,' to Americans and the global community 'that our police are the best in the world,' he said.

{"abstract": "New research suggests that early humans may have started out as scavengers rather than hunters, which could explain how they made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet. Dr Briana Pobiner, a palaeoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by picking the bones left behind by predators. She estimates that early humans like Homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire day's worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators.", "article": "Early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet. However, new research by paleontologists has suggested that our human ancestors may have started out as scavengers rather than the efficient killing machines they are often portrayed as. The findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet. Scroll down for video. Homo erectus, pictured in the reconstruction above, needed around 2200 calories a day to survive and could have easily obtained this by scavenging meat left on the carcasses by predatory big cats in Africa at the time. Dr Briana Pobiner, a palaeoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by picking the bones left behind by predators. She estimates that early humans like Homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators. She told Mail Online: 'Early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants, and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands. 'Probably anything that wasn\u2019t too rotten was fair game.' Lions, like the two eating a zebra kill above, leave large amounts of their kills untouched, meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators. She added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging. She said: 'I think it was both \u2013 probably a combination of scavenging from larger animals and hunting smaller animals. 'One major energetic advantage of scavenging is that you have a really high success rate in the sense that unless a carcass is absolutely picked clean, like what happens after vultures have gotten to it, you\u2019re virtually guaranteed to get some meat and marrow from what\u2019s left. 'With hunting, you can expend a lot of energy and come up empty-handed.' Dr Pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills (as shown above) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be  picked clean by early humans. Speaking in a video on the Smithsonian website, she added:\u00a0'I've found in some of the fossils I studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals. 'Sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps. It has really big implications for a lot of other major changes that happened in human evolutionary history. 'The evolution in meat eating has been linked to an increase in brain size, its been linked to an increase in home range size and maybe the expansion out of Africa. 'Competing with big carnivores you needed sophisticated interaction, communication and other social skills that are another hallmark of being human.' In research published in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern African savanna in Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy. She looked at how much meat was consumed by lions and leopards before measuring what was left for scavengers. She also watched how much meat other large meat eaters like hyenas and jackals left behind once they were finished with a carcass. Dr Briana Pobiner (above) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first. Speaking to Popular Archaeology she said: 'The site is a great analogue for the kinds of African savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived. 'This may have been very much like past carnivore communities during the time our ancestors were starting to eat meat from larger animals, when we have evidence that felids \u2014 ancient lions, leopards, and three species of sabertoothed cats \u2014 lived alongside our ancestors and may have been the dominant kinds of carnivores at this time.' Dr Pobiner found that in modern Africa even a 'defleshed' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it. She estimates that an entire wildebeest or zebra carcass could yield 5kg and 15 kg of meat respectively even after a predator had eaten. This means a wildebeest carcass could provide 2200 calories and a zebra carcass could provide 6080 calories - enough for a small family of Homo erectus.

{"abstract": "The lost city of the Monkey God, also known as La Ciudad Blanca, was discovered by American explorer Theodore Morde in 1940, but he never revealed its location before dying in 1954. Generations of adventurers searched for the city, but experts dismissed Morde's discovery as a self-promoting fantasy. However, a team of US and Honduran archaeologists have now discovered the remains of the city, including extensive plazas, earthworks, mounds, and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived 1,000 years ago, and then vanished.", "article": "American explorer Theodore Morde (pictured) claimed to have found the lost city in 1940. The headline in the New York Times was tantalisingly mysterious: \u2018City of the Monkey God is believed located: Expedition reports success in Honduras exploration\u2019. If readers were a little puzzled as to the huge significance of this announcement, they were soon put right by the man who had made it. The date was July 12, 1940, and American explorer Theodore Morde had just emerged from the darkest jungles of Central America with an incredible story about what he\u2019d found there. Morde, a real-life Indiana Jones who later became a wartime U.S. spy, had been recruited by the founder of New York\u2019s prestigious Museum of the American Indian to try to find a mythical lost \u2018White City\u2019 dripping in gold that had been founded by a mysterious civilisation as great as the Aztecs and the Mayans. Adventurers had been searching for La Ciudad Blanca for centuries, ever since Spanish conquistador and explorer Hernando Cortes conquered Central America in the early 16th century and heard rumours of its riches. But it remained hidden for hundreds of years until Morde insisted he had found it deep in the rain forests of Mosquitia, more than 32,000 square miles of hellishly inhospitable wilderness in Honduras and Nicaragua. He described how, armed only with a revolver and a machete, he and a companion named Lawrence Brown had spent four months hacking their way through \u2018almost inaccessible\u2019 jungle, swamps, rivers and mountains before coming upon a hidden valley that contained the remains of a white-stoned, walled city. There, the local Indians told him, a long-vanished people, who were contemporaries of the Ancient Mayans, had once worshipped a strange Monkey God whose giant statue was still buried under centuries of vegetation. They made bloody human sacrifices to their simian deity, then ate the victims in an act of ritualised cannibalism. Morde said that on his own brief visit he had himself seen a disturbing rite in which local natives ritually slaughtered and ate monkeys in a twisted hangover from the cult. To back his astonishing claims, Morde \u2014 who was only 29 but had already sailed around the world five times \u2014 brought back several thousand artefacts to America such as stone utensils and tiny carved monkey masks. A team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists have announced that they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the City of the Monkey God, in a crater-shaped rainforest valley. He never revealed the precise location of the ruined city for fear it would be looted before he could go back. However, he never returned and died mysteriously in 1954, taking the secret of its location with him. It remained a compelling mystery, seemingly lifted from the pages of H. Rider Haggard. Generations of adventurers plunged into the jungle to search for the city, and experts dismissed Morde\u2019s discovery as a self-promoting fantasy. Explorers who reported glimpsing the tops of white buildings peeking through the forest canopy were told they were just limestone cliffs. But now the sceptics may have to eat their words. A team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists have just returned from La Mosquitia. They have announced that \u2014 like Morde \u2014 they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the City of the Monkey God, in a crater-shaped rainforest valley encircled by steep mountains. According to the National Geographic magazine, which accompanied the expedition, the archaeologists have surveyed and mapped \u2018extensive plazas, earthworks, mounds and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived 1,000 years ago, and then vanished\u2019. The team also discovered a breathtaking collection of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned. Christopher Fisher, an archaeologist from Colorado State University and team member, believes the sculptures \u2014 found at the base of the pyramid \u2014 may have been offerings to the Monkey God. The team first found the ruins nearly three years ago during an aerial survey using a high-tech scanner that was able to pierce the jungle canopy with laser light and reveal archaeological features. The city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured hiding Rama and Sita, two Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. But the Honduran monkey God is more menacing. It showed ruins that stretched for more than a mile along a river through the valley. The remote, rugged area is a major cocaine smuggling route and the scientists, who were ferried to the site by helicopter, were accompanied by Honduran special forces and former members of Britain\u2019s SAS. Wild animals routinely wandered through their camp, clearly never having encountered humans before. Even without excavation, the scientists found 52 artefacts sticking out from the ground with many more clearly lying in the earth and vegetation beneath. They included stone ceremonial seats,", "candidates": [["American explorer Theodore Morde claimed to have found the lost city of La Ciudad Blanca in 1940, which had been hidden for hundreds of years until Morde insisted he had found it deep in the rain forests of Mosquitia, more than 32,000 square miles of hellishly inhospitable wilderness in Honduras and Nicaragua.

The designer hopes the tap will become popular in hotels and luxury homes, but it will be more expensive than ordinary taps.", "article": "A tap that sends the water flowing through it into a swirling vortex pattern could help reduce the amount of water used by households. The designer of the Swirl tap claims the hollow vortex of water created by the faucet can save around 15 per cent more water than standard taps. He claims that it is also more comfortable to use as the water does not pour out in a solid jet. The Swirl tap sends water from the tap in a symmetrical design that apparently saves 15 per cent more water. Simin Qiu, a student at the London Royal College of Art, said he hoped the design might become popular in hotels and homes. He said: 'It's a very simple design. I've used two turbines to create the effect, with one making the water flow clockwise and the other anticlockwise. 'The spiral is an organic shape water takes in nature and I wanted to recreate that. 'It is more comfortable on people's hands because it's not flowing in a solid line. My design changes the angle the water hits your hands at and it's smoother.' Mr Qiu is curerntly testing a prototype of his tap, which took him two months to design. It uses turbines that spin in opposite directions inside the valve at the mouth of the tap to send thin streams of water spiralling down into the sink. The Swirl tap uses two turbines inside the faucet (left) to send the water into a spiral. The graphic on the right shows how the turbines fit together with push value to provide a spinning vortex of water onto the users hands. The tap works by pressing a single button on top, allowing water at a preset temperature to flow out of the tap. The tap is operated by touching a switch on the top. Mr Qiu says the desing allows water to come out at the same pressure as a standard faucet but uses less water. However, the temperature from the tap has to be preset so that the water coming out will always be the right temperature. Mr Qui added: 'I hope it will be ready by the end of the year. 'It will be more expensive than ordinary taps, it's not something that will be in every home. 'It's a luxury product that will probably be in hotels and limited use in homes by next year.' Designer Simin Qiu envisages his tap being used in hotels and luxury homes but it could find wider uses as the swirling pattern it produces in the flow can help to reduce the amount of water used when washing hands.", "candidates": [["A tap designed by Simin Qiu, a student at the London Royal College of Art, has been developed to reduce the amount of water used by households.

Faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery in his flat in Fulham, West London, she rushed to the shops to find replacements in more neutral tones, but struggled when it came to buying good quality bed linen in the purest of whites. She didn\u2019t know it at the time, of course, but that day in 1993 marked the moment Rucker began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white. Scroll down for video. Chrissie Rucker is the founder and director of The White Company and is pictured here with a selection of her products. More than two decades on, the 46-year-old founder of The White Company is one of the UK\u2019s wealthiest businesswomen having transformed what began as a 12-page mail-order catalogue selling white towels and bed linen into a home furnishings and fashion empire. Her business sells everything from \u00a320 scented candles to \u00a3200 cashmere jumpers, and while she has branched out to shades such as \u2018biscuit marl\u2019 and \u2018cloud grey\u2019, Rucker remains obsessed with all things pale. Her white revolution has seen sales soaring at her 53 High Street stores \u2014 even the Queen has sent out her ladies-in-waiting to buy bedspreads \u2014 and has spread across the Atlantic where she launched a U.S. website last year. Latest figures show that the mother-of-four\u2019s company made pre-tax profits of \u00a36.5 million last year \u2014 an increase of 38 per cent. Her position on the Sunday Times Rich list has climbed steeply from 427th to 326th. She and her husband\u2019s combined wealth is estimated at \u00a3295 million. Aside from the money pouring into company coffers, Rucker owns three stunning properties, all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors. There\u2019s a \u00a312.5 million 17th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire, set in 51 acres of parkland, a \u00a34 million townhouse in London\u2019s fashionable Holland Park and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the Swiss Alps, Haus Alpina, a luxury chalet with full-time staff which Rucker rents out for a staggering \u00a326,000 a week. Chrissie, pictured at her Buckinghamshire home, realised she had found a gap in the market when she was looking to decorate her future husband's house all in white. Even at Rucker\u2019s main residence, the country mansion, the only flashes of colour you\u2019ll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse-mad daughters. All in all, it\u2019s a rather surprising state of affairs for a woman who disappointed her parents by leaving school at 16 with six O-levels and signing up at the Lucie Clayton finishing school which promised to prepare girls for marriage, society and \u2018the season\u2019. However, it was not long before Rucker decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the London social circuit. Indeed, the statuesque blonde\u2019s path to fortune is rather more colourful than her dazzling white shops might suggest. Belinda Christian Rucker, as she was named by her parents, was born in 1968 into an illustrious military family \u2014 her maternal grandfather, Sir Harold Pyman, was Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in Europe and a recipient of the Knight Grand Cross and Distinguished Service Order. The daughter of commodity broker, Patrick Rucker, Chrissie, as she was known, grew up in Kent and attended \u00a35,275-a-term Combe Bank School in Kent. Her parents divorced, and aged seven, she and her younger sister, Jo, went with their mother Rosemary, a horse breeder, to live with their new step-father, estate agent Jeremy Calcutt. Those days, she recalled, were happy but chaotic. \u2018My mother was really only interested in her horses,\u2019 she said, \u2018so the stables were immaculate, the house a tip.\u2019 Chrissie's husband, Nick Wheeler (pictured),\u00a0set up his shirt company, Charles Tyrwhitt, in 1986 while a geography student at Bristol University. It was all a far cry from the vision Rucker would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light. Her early ambitions lay in fashion. While at Lucy Clayton she studied dressmaking and design. But as a teenager in London in the late Eighties, Rucker seemed intent on immersing herself in a \u2018Sloane Ranger\u2019 lifestyle.

{"abstract": "A new study has found that cholesterol-lowering statins can reduce the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10%. The research, which involved a review of 17 statin trials and over 100,000 patients, is the first to show the benefits of statins for those at risk of heart failure. The study was conducted by scientists from the University of Glasgow and was reported at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress in Glasgow.", "article": "Statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, researchers claim. A breakthrough study found that the cholesterol-lowering drugs improved outcomes for those suffering from the common cardiac disorder. The medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks. Prevention?\u00a0Cholesterol-lowering statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, Scottish researchers found. But the latest research is the first to show the benefits for those at risk of heart failure \u2013 which occurs when the organ struggles to maintain adequate blood flow to the body. Scientists from the University of Glasgow said their findings herald a \u2018significant benefit\u2019 for the near-one million Britons affected by the condition. Exerts from the university\u2019s Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences reviewed 17 statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients as part of their analysis. Lead researcher Dr David Preiss said: \u2018Heart failure is disabling, expensive to treat, especially in more advanced stages, and patients have a poor outcome. \u2018While it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks, to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before. \u2018The results of this analysis clearly show a modest, but significant benefit, reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent, which is clinically important.\u2019 Heart failure happens when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Around 100,000 Britons a year are thought to die from it. Damage: Heart failure (pictured) affects nearly a million Birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body. Figures show 15 per cent of patients with the condition die in hospital \u2013 twice the European average \u2013 partly because of late diagnosis and treatment that fails to adequately control symptoms. Signs including swollen legs, tiredness and shortness of breath \u2013 which usually worsen following exercise. Dr Preiss added: \u2018It is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia [lack of blood flow] that occurs before a heart attack, leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart. \u2018Further study of the potential mechanism is needed.\u2019 The study found a 10 per cent reduction in first hospital admissions for heart failure, although researchers believe the impact of statins has been underestimated. The study was reported at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress in Glasgow and was published online in The European Heart Journal. Between eight and ten million adults take statins \u2013 which are now the most widely prescribed drugs in the UK. The NHS estimates they save 7,000 lives a year in the UK, despite growing concern over the extent of side effects such as increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Doctors once prescribed the drug to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade, but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Under current guidance, the threshold is even lower. Those who have a 10 per cent or greater risk are being offered statins, including patients aged 80 and over. Cholesterol-lowering drugs can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, researchers\u00a0claim. A new study shows for the first time that statins improve the outcome for those suffering from a common heart disorder. Researchers from the University of Glasgow carried out a review of 17 statin trials including over 100,000 patients. The new drugs block\u00a0bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs. A new type of cholesterol-lowering drug may halve the risk of a heart attack or stroke, new research suggests. People taking the experimental drug for high cholesterol were half as likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke as those taking conventional statins. The results could offer an alternative to the estimated one in three Westerners with high cholesterol who have been unable to manage their condition with diet, exercise and statin drugs currently on the market. The results are'really impressive and very encouraging' for the new drugs, said one independent expert, Dr Judith Hochman of NYU Langone Medical Center. The U.S. government will decide this summer whether to allow two of these drugs on the market. The drugs are evolocumab, which Amgen wants to call Repatha, and alirocumab, which Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi have named Praluent. They lower LDL or bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs, by blocking PCSK9, a substance that interferes with the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. Side effects remain a question, though, especially on thinking, confusion and memory - problems the FDA has already voiced concern about and asked the companies to track.

{"abstract": "The author's husband is seriously ill and has been in the hospital for over a month with no clear diagnosis. When a consultant arrives to give a diagnosis, she speaks down to the author and her husband with hostile body language. The author reflects on the importance of bedside manner and shares a positive experience with a different consultant who showed kindness and compassion during her husband's year-long medical journey.", "article": "Here's the scene: My husband Tony is desperately ill and I'm sitting by his hospital bed. He's been sick for weeks and at one stage I was told he was expected to die. He's now out of a coma and no longer, thank God, one of the ten sickest people in the vast teaching hospital. But still no one knows what's wrong with him. He's been moved from the intensive care unit into a small room when suddenly a consultant descends. Sarah Foot says that while with her sick husband Tony in hospital a consultant with hostile body language\u00a0came crashing in and started talking down to them as she gave the diagnosis. She crashes through the door, followed by half a dozen of her juniors, who crowd round the bed and wait for her to speak. No one's in any doubt who's in charge. She talks not at us, but down to us, like some reincarnation of the monstrous Sir Lancelot Spratt (played by James Robertson Justice) from the Doctor In The House films. Except this isn't funny. Tony has been in hospital for more than a month, but how or why he got ill so suddenly no one really knows. One minute I was wondering whether he just had man flu; the next he was delirious with fever and dreadful abdominal pains, and being rushed to hospital in an ambulance. Just 48 hours later, he was in a drug-induced coma with sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by an infection, his organs shutting down one by one. When he was admitted, his symptoms suggested pancreatitis - where the pancreas becomes inflamed. I want to know if the doctors are any the wiser about what caused his body to go into free fall. Sarah accompanied Tony as he was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, and shortly after was in a drug-induced coma with sepsis. So, looking up at the sea of faces, I ask: 'Was it pancreatitis that started this?' I remain sitting, because if I stand, Tony - who is unable to speak for himself as he has a tube in his windpipe - will feel even more helpless. 'Yes,' the consultant declares haughtily, 'he presented with similar symptoms.' 'But was it actually pancreatitis?' She repeats herself impatiently: 'Yes, he presented with similar symptoms.' Her hostile body language is telling me to shut up and know my place. I try again, but still she answers like a politician, repeating the same refrain. Then she shuffles her notes and says that another consultant is coming to discuss a kidney tumour that showed up on a scan. This news floors me. 'No one mentioned a tumour.' 'Yes, they did.' 'No, they didn't.' 'Yes, they did.' For a moment we are in panto territory with someone whose life is hanging by a thread lying terrified between us. Then off she breezes. I'm torn between bursting into tears and storming into the corridor to tell those junior doctors that if they learn one thing today, it's how not to talk to the sick and their loved ones. Patient's relative meets doctors: it's a scene repeated daily in hospitals all over the country. You can guarantee the next of kin are frightened and exhausted. Life and death are routine for medical staff, but for the rest of us they are, well, life and death. Doctors will argue they are appallingly busy, would love to give people more attention, but don't have the time. Or that to do their job properly they need the emotional distance. I can understand that. But here's another story from the same hospital. Same patient, different consultant, working under exactly the same pressure and constraints as the others. And his approach was so full of kindness and compassion that I wonder whether the disparity between those who have a good bedside manner and those who don't is about individuals rather than the pressure of the job. This man became our rock when Tony's illness - whatever caused the sepsis in the first place was never identified - sparked off a chain reaction that had doctors chasing problems around his body for a year after he was admitted in March 2006. One serious ailment would be contained, only for another to present. There was massive internal damage from the sepsis to be repaired surgically, but also an aortic aneurysm (a swelling of the main blood vessel leading from the heart) to be bypassed and more infections to be cured. Not to mention that cancerous kidney tumour to be dealt with when he was well enough. 'Roller-coaster' doesn't come near the ride he was on. Much of his care fell to this one particular specialist, a urologist, who, to my astonishment, gave me his mobile phone number and told me to call if I had concerns. One Sunday night, eight months into this medical odyssey, Tony was nauseous, with his temperature rising and his remaining strength draining fast.

{"abstract": "Arsene Wenger has been the manager of Arsenal for almost 19 years, surviving 156 Premier League bosses and leading the Gunners to their first Champions League final and three Premier League titles. In an era where Premier League chairmen are quick to fire their managers, Wenger's longevity is remarkable. Only 18 managers have left their job by choice to go straight into another job in the last 18 years, while some resigned and a handful retired.", "article": "Since September 1996, Arsene Wenger has ruled the roost at Arsenal, not just building a squad and controlling a team, but shaping a club. In almost 19 years in charge of the Gunners, Wenger has won three Premier League titles, lifted five FA Cups, led his team to their only ever European final and masterminded the move to the Emirates. When he does eventually decide to step down, Wenger\u2019s legacy will not just be about his successes, but also his longevity. Arsene Wenger has been at Arsenal for almost 19 years, while every other team has changed manager. Wenger led the Gunners to their first Champions League final, and has won three Premier League titles. The Arsenal boss has been in north London since September 1996, surviving 156 Premier League bosses. In an era where Premier League chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as Jose Mourinho tends to be towards referees, Wenger is approaching two decades in the job \u2013 almost 15 years longer than the next longest-serving manager in the division. In fact, since the Frenchman arrived in north London, there have been 156 changes in management at the other clubs in the division. Here Sporstmail looks at the men Wenger has survived\u2026. What counts as a change? With caretaker managers, interim appointments, and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time, it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers. Counting caretaker managers would mean, technically, that David Pleat had been appointed Tottenham manager three times in five years. There were times when it seemed David Pleat just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at Spurs again. Ruud Gullit had already left two Premier League clubs before Wenger had been in the job three years. Gordon Strachan (left) replacing Ron Atkinson was the second change after Wenger arrived. So while \u2018interim\u2019 managers are included in our total, caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term. Added to that, for those few occasions when two men have been in charge at the same time, they are counted as only one sacking unless, as with the case of Roy Evans when he worked alongside Gerard Houlier at Liverpool, one is sacked before the other. Landmarks. That all means that Gus Poyet\u2019s sacking this month is the 156th managerial change since Wenger took over. Ray Harford\u2019s resignation at Blackburn, less than a month after \u2018the Professor\u2019 got his feet under the desk at Arsenal, was the first, with five more coming in the 1996-97 season. Ray Harford (left) was the first manager to go after Wenger was appointed, while Gus Poyet is the most recent. Peter Reid\u2019s dismissal from Leeds United in November 2003 marked the 50th reign Wenger had survived, while Steve Bruce\u2019s decision to leave Wigan for Sunderland brought up the century in the summer of 2009. Tony Pulis\u2019 shock resignation from Crystal Palace on the eve of this season was the 150th time a manager had left their job in the Wenger era. Peter Reid, sacked by Leeds in 2003, marked the 50th Premier League manager to go in the Wenger era. When Steve Bruce left Wigan for Sunderland it marked the 100th managerial change since Wenger arrived. Unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years. The first half of Wenger\u2019s tenure at Arsenal produced just 63 sackings in a little over nine years. In the same time since then, there have been 93 changes, at a rate of around 10 a season. Last season\u2019s total of 14 managerial changes was, in fact, the largest number in Premier League history. In contrast the 2002-03 season saw the fewest changes since Wenger\u2019s arrival, with only five managers leaving their posts. Tony Pulis' resignation from Crystal Palace last summer was change No 150 since Wenger started. Method of change? The vast majority of the time, when a Premier League manager leaves his job, it\u2019s because he\u2019s been told to clear out his desk. A lucky few get to set their own date, as Wenger surely will in the coming years, but most are pushed before they can jump. Remarkably, in the last 18-and-a-bit years since Wenger joined Arsenal, only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job (and three of those went to international management rather than another club), while some resigned and a handful retired. Roy Hodgson is one of only two Premier League managers in the past two decades to leave for England. Steve McClaren also left a Premier League club to take the biggest job in English football. Three times a manager stepped down for health reasons, although two of those were Joe Kinnear, while one manager, Dave Jones, was placed on gardening leave in January 2000. Ron Atkinson (Coventry) and Steve Coppell (Crystal Palace) share the honour of being the two", "candidates": [["Arsene Wenger has been the manager of Arsenal for almost 19 years, surviving 156 Premier League bosses.

{"abstract": "A legal battle is ongoing between the UK government and a family whose daughter developed narcolepsy after being vaccinated against swine flu in 2009. The vaccine, Pandemrix, was administered to over 900,000 children in the UK during the outbreak. The family\u2019s case has gone to court on appeal, despite the government\u2019s scientists admitting two years ago that the vaccine could cause narcolepsy, having previously denied any link.", "article": "Bubbly: But Mathilda soon developed narcolepsy, suffering from terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain. When Claire Crisp agreed to have her three-year-old daughter Mathilda vaccinated against swine flu, she believed she was doing the best to protect her from a life-threatening pandemic. In 2009, all children under five were invited to be vaccinated in a nationwide scheme. Fortunately, the much-feared 2009-2010 outbreak never reached the pandemic scale expected. But Claire is\u00a0convinced that the vaccine against it has left Mathilda with severe narcolepsy. Mathilda is the youngest known person in the world to be diagnosed with the neurological condition, which causes sufferers to suddenly fall asleep during the day. Mathilda also had terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain.Now she is part of a protracted legal battle against the Government for compensation for vaccine-related narcolepsy. Last week, their case went to court on appeal. This wrangling has continued despite the fact the Government\u2019s scientists admitted two years ago that the vaccine, Pandemrix, could cause narcolepsy, having previously denied any link. In a statistical investigation, published in the British Medical Journal, they found children given the vaccine were 14 times more likely to have developed narcolepsy than unvaccinated children. Claire, 44, a former NHS physiotherapist, thought she was playing safe when she had Mathilda vaccinated. Doctors had suggested her daughter could be at particular risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition, laryngomalacia, which obstructs breathing. Children normally grow out of it by three. \u2018We took the swine flu risk seriously since Mathilda had only recently outgrown laryngomalacia,\u2019 says Claire, who also has a son, Elliot, and another daughter, Liberty. NHS clinics administered more than 900,000 doses of Pandemrix in 2009 and 2010. Mathilda\u2019s first troubling symptoms developed within two weeks. Her sleep became disturbed, leaving her exhausted in the day. Then she began to suffer from hallucinations at night, thinking there were demons in her bedroom. \u2018The symptoms just got worse \u2014 she wasn\u2019t sleeping at night, and sleeping and crying all day,\u2019 says Claire. \u2018Nearly every time I turned round in the day, she was asleep. \u2018She was slurring her words. She could not walk in a straight line, she suffered excruciating leg pains. She also became incontinent.\u2019 Then she developed cataplexy, where she\u2019d become temporarily paralysed for seconds by emotional triggers such as happiness or surprise, though staying conscious. \u2018Her brother would say a joke and she would fall down,\u2019 says Claire. Within six months, Claire and her husband Oliver, a professor of theology, were housebound caring for Mathilda. She was taken to a children\u2019s hospital for what Claire calls \u2018a series of failed visits\u2019. Initially, doctors thought she had a brain tumour, but after tests they ruled that out. \u2018The doctors quickly wrote us off as an anxious mother and a pain-in-the-a*** child.\u2019 The family was being referred to a psychiatric unit when a locum doctor from India diagnosed narcolepsy, which normally appears at around the age of 15. Doctors had suggested to Claire her daughter could be at risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition. Claire spoke to a friend\u2019s cousin, who has narcolepsy. \u2018They warned me that we probably wouldn\u2019t get any help for it in Europe, but said Stanford University in California had the world\u2019s best expertise. I got in touch with them.\u2019 Based on blood samples sent by post, experts at the university confirmed the diagnosis. The acknowledged world expert in the condition, Dr Emmanuel Mignot, is the director of the university\u2019s Centre for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. He is recognised for finding the cause of narcolepsy \u2014 the failure of special \u2018wakefulness\u2019 cells, called hypocretins, found in the brain\u2019s sleep centre. Dr Mignot has also identified a possible reason why the vaccine has caused narcolepsy: a part of the swine flu virus is similar to a part of the hypocretin cell. The Pandemrix vaccine primes the immune system\u2019s \u2018killer\u2019 cells to attack this part of the swine flu virus. But in a minority of patients, the killer cells also mistakenly attack the hypocretin cells, thinking they are swine flu cells. The risk is confined to people with a susceptible genetic make-up, Dr Mignot wrote in the journal Science Translational Medicine in 2013 \u2014 with around 20 per cent of the European population having this gene profile.

She told Fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her  flowers on Valentine's Day - but that Anderson would never agree to meet up. At the same time, another victim, Sara Vanwagenen, believed she was in a relationship with a man called 'Hyrum Young'.

For a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution. Fabian Delph of England speaks to the media during the England press conference ahead of the clash with Italy. Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed bite to Roy Hodgson\u2019s midfield. Delph \u00a0cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years. The Aston Villa midfielder soon settled, however, and it turned out to be neither. He produced a terrific display in Basle and won his fourth cap against Lithuania on Friday. He has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and, after collecting 20 in two years, has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be more careful,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I like to tackle and I\u2019ve managed to curb it this season. I got the yellow against Switzerland and then the red against Sunderland but other than that I\u2019ve been pretty clean. I\u2019m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage! \u2018It\u2019s hard to lunge into tackles in international football. If you lunge in on a top-class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down. I tried to set a target. I\u2019ve been able to do that so I\u2019m quite proud.\u2019 Harry Kane made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at Wembley Stadium. Both Kane and Delph shone for England as Roy Hodgson's side swept Lithuania aside at Wembley. Even so, his natural aggression lifted England in Switzerland, where a 2-0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the World Cup. \u2018I remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong, but it didn\u2019t faze me,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018It was one of those things. I tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it. After that it was just about trying to stay on my feet, trying to get through the game, trying to perform well, with good energy, keep the ball moving and I managed to do that.\u2019 Dennis Wise can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage Delph during one of the regular games between the Leeds staff and youth team. Wise, manager at Elland Road at the time, liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18. Lithuania's Tomas Mikuckis tracks Aston Villa and England midfielder Delph during the game at Wembley. \u2018Those games did get quite tasty,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I did tackle him and he tackled me back. They tended to get quite heated. He gave me my debut. I\u2019m so grateful to Dennis. And Gus Poyet, his assistant. Gus could kick a few people as well.\u2019 This breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from Delph and his mother Donna, who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions. \u2018It\u2019s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training,\u2019 he said. \u2018At one point, it would take three buses and one train. But it\u2019s worked out well. I\u2019ve always been pushed hard to succeed. To get those buses, it was nothing.\u2019 As soon as he was able, he bought his mother a house. \u2018She\u2019s my hero,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018We didn\u2019t have a car, so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me. She was just a great Mum and a great role model.\u2019 Delph speaks to the media at an England press conference ahead of the midweek clash with Italy. Determination is a recurring theme for Delph, who swapped hometown Bradford for Leeds at the age of 11 and then joined Villa for \u00a36million in 2009, only to be hit by serious knee injuries. \u2018I ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and (knee surgeon) Andy Williams managed to save that,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I got back quite quickly and then broke down four times.

The aim will be for Bjorkman to travel with Murray during the weeks when Mauresmo is unavailable, while they will also work together at certain times of the year. Murray said: 'We've agreed for him to work with us for a week just to try and see how it goes. Normally when I've started working with coaches I've done that. 'I know him very well from when he played. He was one of the older guys when I came on the tour and he was very good to me. He's a very nice person, good sense of humour. And he was an exceptional tennis player who made the most of his ability. Former world No 4 Jonas Bjorkman will join up with Team Murray for a trial week as assistant coach. 'A lot of Swedes turn out to be good coaches. They've got a good mindset, they're very calm individuals and extremely hard workers. Hopefully when we try it out together it works well.' Bjorkman reached number four in the singles rankings and number one in doubles, winning nine grand slam titles. Since retiring in 2008 he has worked in the media, as a coach with Sweden's Davis Cup team and behind the scenes at the ATP tournaments in Bastad and Stockholm. He becomes the latest Swede to take up a high-profile coaching role in men's tennis after Magnus Norman, who guided Stan Wawrinka to the Australian Open title last year, and Roger Federer's part-time mentor Stefan Edberg. Bjorkman agreed with Murray's assessment of Swedish strengths but also said he hoped to bring energy and fun to training sessions. Andy Murray celebrates after securing victory for Great Britain against the USA in the Davis Cup in Glasgow. Recalling how he became friends with Murray, Bjorkman said: 'I always spent quite a lot of time around Tim (Henman). 'When Andy came along, he was going to be the new superstar, I met him straight away and we connected well. 'He's a great guy, great sense of humour. Both of us like to have a little bit of a trash talk, we are interested in other sports. The only negative was he beat me twice. But I'm really looking forward to it.' Bjorkman revealed he has been speaking to Mauresmo on the phone and believes they are singing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to Murray's game. Andy Murray takes aim with a serve as he prepares for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. 'It feels great,' he said. 'I really like the way she believes Andy should play and how they've been working. 'Andy's in a great situation now, he played phenomenal tennis in Australia. The match against (Tomas) Berdych I believe was the best since his injury. He's at his prime with his age and has some interesting years ahead of him.' Murray and Mauresmo are currently in Indian Wells for the first Masters tournament of the season, where he will begin his campaign this weekend against Canadian Vasek Pospisil.

Super Saturday rivals the Melbourne Cup for the sport's grand occasions.. and this may just be the pipe-opener for even bigger days ahead this Autumn, including Nicole Richie's role as international ambassador for the Golden Slipper. But before her arrival, the world's three fastest horses, all Australian, will race for the $1 million prize at Flemington on what is dubbed 'Super Saturday'. The young bucks and fabulous fillies, however, will be on show on course and around it too, with Ladies Day at Rosehill. The best horses have been put through their paces at trackwork this week ahead of going on show on Super Saturday across Melbourne and Sydney. The battle to be the world's best.\u00a0Lankan Rupee enjoys a hose down after his trackwork session at Caulfield ahead of lining up in the Group One Newmarket Handicap at Flemington's 'Super Saturday' meeting. The ATC International Ambassador, Nicole Richie, is scheduled to arrive in Sydney next week for day two of the Golden Slipper Carnival. The world\u2019s highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee from the Mick Price stable and Terravista, trained by Joe Pride, are at the top of betting for the $1 million Group 1 Lexus Newmarket Handicap. Lankan Rupee has returned in stellar form, fresh from a triumphant first-up run in the Black Caviar Lightning on February 21. He will have to lump top weight of 58.5kg as he aims to become only the fifth horse to record consecutive Newmarket wins, after saluting last March. A winner of 11 of 21 career starts, Lankan Rupee will have to equal Hay List\u2019s metric weight-carrying record if he is to muster a sixth career Group 1. To do that he will have to overcome\u00a0Terravista, who is ridden by the in-form Hugh Bowman. Joe Pride's star sprinter was a very impressive winner of the Group 1 Darley Classic over the Newmarket course and distance during the Melbourne Cup Carnival. To his great advantage, he has two kilos less than Lankan Rupee, in trying to beat history by becoming the first horse since 1917 to taste first-up success in the Newmarket. And if they don't salute, waiting in the wings to claim the title of world's best is another star, Chautauqua, who will carry 55.5kg. The impressive grey has not yet won a Group 1 in 11 starts, but has saluted twice in Group 2 events. Trained by the Hawkes triumvirate, the four-year-old was beaten less than a neck by Terravista and finished ahead of Lankan Rupee in the Darley Classic. 'This year\u2019s Newmarket is shaping as one of the most exciting renewals in history with the world\u2019s three highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee, Terravista and Chautauqua, all expected to take their place on Super Saturday,' Racing Victoria handicapper Neil Jennings said. ATC Ambassador Erika Heynatz poses with Aussie at Rosehill Gardens ahead of Ladies Day, day one of the Golden Slipper Carnival. Lankan Rupee will take of Terravista and up-and-coming sprinters Chautauqua and Brazen Beau in the million dollar sprint down the Flemington straight on Saturday. Up for grabs is title of world's best sprinter. Jockey Craig Williams appears happy with his mount in the $1 million Australian Cup. But Protectionist, the reigning Melbourne Cup champ will need to overcome favourite Happy Trails, among others, to make history at Flemington on Super Saturday. Leading jockey Craig Williams leads 2014 Melbourne Cup winner Protectionist out of his stalls ahead of his run in the $1 million Australian Cup. Craig Williams will take the ride on the Kris Lee-trained Protectionist, who is aiming to equal the likes of Makybe Diva and Fiorente as horses to have claimed the elusive Melbourne Cup and Australian Cup double. And there's no knock on the Chris Waller trained Brazen Beau either, carrying the lighweight 52kg and with star jockey Joao Moreira in the saddle, he will be primed for the 1200m event, off the back of a second to Lankan Rupee. The Kris Lees-trained Protectionist has drawn barrier three as he looks to emulate the deeds of 2013 Melbourne Cup winner Fiorente, by claiming the $1 million Australian Cup in his following preparation. 16 horses accepted for the $1 million 2000 metre Group 1, which will be one of the highlights of Flemington\u2019s \u2018Super Saturday\u2019.

Workers had positioned the carousel-style attraction so close to the front door that it could not even be fully opened. Taken for a ride: A caf\u00e9 owner in Grantham, Lincolnshire, was forced to shut up shop for three days after the local council put up a fairground carousel ride just inches from his shop window. Sandwiched in: Workers had positioned the carousel-style attraction so close to the front door of Cafe Leo that it could not even be fully opened. And even though the council apparently agreed the positioning was rather inconvenient, officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up for the event. Mr Meakin now has to wait until tomorrow, the end of the local Mid-Lent Fair, to re-open the cafe. He said: 'What customer wants to sit having a coffee and look out the window at the back end of a giant fairground ride. It was just really inconsiderate to say the least. 'Everybody thought we were closed anyway. You couldn't get anywhere near the shop really. It was unbelievable. 'It was literally 3ft away from the window. Who could ever think that was a good idea?' Mr Meakin, who runs the cafe with wife Jessica, said the 'barmy' decision forced him to close the cafe, a move which he said cost his business at least \u00a31,000. Clear view: Mr Meakin could barely see out of the window after the ride was put up directly outside the cafe. Prettier sight: The area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs (pictured) for al fresco diners was also completely taken over. He claimed the ride had so badly obstructed the view that the entire premises was plunged into darkness.

Mr Meakin was forced to close the caf\u00e9 early on Monday afternoon. It remained closed all day Tuesday, Wednesday and today. He is due to reopen tomorrow, once the fair has ended. He said: 'The ride position was just not acceptable so we left it until the council came back and had a proper look. 'When somebody from the council came they agreed and said it's unacceptable so I don't know how someone could have said it was before.

Ms Dronfield, from Coventry, was stabbed in the neck by Smith on February 2 last year. He then stamped on her head, leaving her with horrific injuries. She suffered a cracked cheekbone, a bleed on the brain and the stab wound was just 1cm from her jugular vein. The savage assault also left her with short term memory loss which meant she was unable to recall the hours before the attack.

But prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with Nightly News after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old desk. Brian Williams agreed to a five-year contract after being persuaded by NBC News President Deborah Turness, who gifted him with\u00a0veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old writing desk. And few years ago, Williams told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno. Burke turned down Williams's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center, which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show. Instead, the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons, according to New York Magazine. Williams pushed on, however, and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman. Moonves wasn't interested, sources told New York Magazine. Williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by NBC News president Deborah Turness. Though they first clashed - because Williams was used to having the final say over a show's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another. Brian Williams suggested succeeding both Jay Leno (left) and David Letterman (right). CEOs from NBC and CBS turned down his offers.

Raw milk has not been pasteurized by heat treatment, which kills E.coli, campylobacter, salmonella, and listeria. The study concludes that the risks of consuming raw milk are well-established and discourage its consumption, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women, and children.", "article": "The trend for\u00a0fresh, local, unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk. This is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version. Raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk-related food borne illnesses, even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the US drink it. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. \u00a0Advocates believe it is s healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. But a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised \u2013 heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same. Advocates believe that raw milk, which contains more natural antibodies, proteins, and bacteria than pasteurised milk, is healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. They argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. But the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate. They claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious Salmonella, Campylobacter,and Listeria species along with the most dangerous form of E. coli. These bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans, including diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, fevers, and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death. 'The risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well-established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences,' says Cissy Li, a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Based on our findings, we discourage the consumption of raw milk, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women, and children.' Pasteurisation involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination, dairy operations, cow udders, or other sources. Treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future conducted an analysis of 81 published scientific journal articles,. 'Ultimately, the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurised milk,' says report lead author Benjamin Davis, also a graduate student in environmental health sciences. 'Although potential benefits related to the consumption of raw milk would benefit from further investigation, we believe that, from a public health perspective, it is a far safer choice to discourage the consumption of raw milk.' The study comes as incidents on three farms selling raw milk  led to E.coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28.

A 17-year-old boy was taken off a plane at Sydney airport on March 12 and interviewed by counter-terrorism officers, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed on Wednesday. It comes after two teenage brothers were also discovered doing the same thing earlier this month. A third teenager has been caught by authorities trying to join Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East. The incident happened on March 12 and charges have not been laid against the boy. The boy is the third teenager government officials have intercepted among about 200 people stopped from heading overseas to become foreign fighters with terrorist groups. He has since returned to his family, with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO investigating the matter. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said while it was hard to believe people who had grown up in Australia's free and open society could be susceptible to brain washing by extremist groups such as Islamic State, it was clearly happening. 'It is very dangerous for you. It is very dangerous for others,' he told reporters in Canberra. It follows two brothers who were detained for doing the same earlier this month (pictured above) The siblings aged 16 and 17 were questioned by counter-terrorism officers before they were sent home to their mother in Sydney's south-west. There are fears that more teenagers could end up like\u00a0Abdullah Elmir (pictured) who has been dubbed the 'Ginger Jihadist' Elmir (front centre) has appeared in propaganda videos since he arrived in the Middle East (above) 'We will do everything we can to stop you if you do try.' The two brothers who were stopped earlier this month were aged 16 and 17. The siblings were south-west Sydney and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained. Authorities\u2019 suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage was searched. The latest teenager to be caught were trying to fly to the Middle East like notorious extremists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Mohamed Elomar (above) has caused a stir on social media after posting photos of him with weapons and severed heads. Meanwhile Khaled Sharrouf made international headlines after he posted photos of his children posing with guns. The above photograph is Sharrouf posing with his children in front of an Islamic State flag and rifles. The two boys were stopped on the night of March 6, Mr Dutton said at the time of the revelation. Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State. Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos.

The company reckons its \u00a380 jacket and \u00a360 trousers, made from 'high-standard' textile designed to protect against abrasion, are the cheapest in Britain. And they are certainly a bargain compared to the prices of brand\u00a0leader Weise Avance, whose motorcycle jacket and jeans retail for \u00a31,219.98 altogether - the jacket for \u00a3639.99 and trousers for \u00a3579.99. Aldi is launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear, with this whole outfit costing just \u00a3180. The range of clothes that includes a trousers, boots for \u00a329.99, motorcycle tank bags at a bargain \u00a312.99 and gloves at \u00a319.99,  is sure to be snapped up in minutes when it's released on March 8. The store will also sell thermal under layers including a long-sleeved top and long johns. And not only are the clothes a much more affordable option for motorbiking enthusiasts, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. The pass zone for the Level 2 impact abrasion test is seven seconds of abrasion resistance in body zones 1 and 2, which include the shoulders and elbows. Aldi's jacket and trousers exceed these requirements, achieving over 13 seconds of abrasion resistance across all four zones of the garment. John Chatterton-Ross, of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), the governing body for motorcycle racing, said: 'This is the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices. Not only are the clothes an affordable option, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. Pictured: High-standard textile jacket, \u00a380. 'The protection offered by Aldi's products exceeds the requirements for impact abrasion and impact cut resistance demanded by the European standard for zones 1 and 2 in all zones. 'Few products on the market can match this. Often, even in premium brands, it is only the protectors that are certified, not the rest of the garment. 'It is great to see that with Aldi's motorcycling jacket and trousers, safety does not have to come with a high price tag.' The motorcycling range comes after a whole host of specialist ranges launched by the supermarket - from Equestrian and fishing gear, to yoga and even ski clothing and accessories. And just last June, the chain even brought\u00a0the world's most expensive beef, Wagyu, to its aisles at \u00a36.99 for a sirloin steak.

But text speak has not been the disaster for language many feared and one leading linguist has claimed it actually improves people's writing and spelling. Professor David Crystal, an honorary professor at Bangor University, said those who text regularly were found to be 'concentrating their minds' on the relationship between sounds and  written words. The linguist, who has written more than 100 books on the English language, pointed out a new generation is 'constantly' reading and writing online. 'People say text messaging will harm your spelling. No...It helps you to spell better,' he said at the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai according to the Daily Telegraph. 'This is because it focuses your mind on the connection between sound and letters. 'The best texters are the best spellers. 'People say young people don't read and write any more.'They may not necessarily read... Shakespeare or Charles Dickens, but have you ever seen a teenager not reading? 'Young people read probably more than I did when I was that age.' He said the digital age had not necessarily heralded a 'linguistic revolution' in the way critics had predicted and said the'moral panic' of the potential change has not been justified. Professor Crystal's studies have found around 2,000 new words developed as a result of the digital age, including terms such as blog and twittersphere. He said  additions have so far not had a major, or negative, impact on the English language, which has more than one million  words. The linguist said many abbreviations such as 'c u l8r' are not commonly used by modern teenagers. Professor Crystal also claimed that hashtags, used on Twitter, are simply a new method of managing and classifying information and were likely to stay. Professor David Crystal dismissed claims youngsters were not reading as much today as they had done in the past. His comments dispel previous claims abbreviated language was worsening teenagers' grasp of the English language. In 2012 a study claimed the grammar standards of school pupils aged 10-12 had slipped as a result of constantly using shortened phrases. Researchers urged parents not to communicate with their children in text speak to avoid their abilities suffering more. Last year it was claimed Britons spent more time using mobile phones, computers and handheld tablets than they did sleeping. Information gathered by Ofcom, the television watchdog, found the average adult slept for eight hours 21 minutes but spent 20 minutes longer connected to technology.", "candidates": [["Prof. David Crystal, a leading linguist, has claimed that abbreviating words in text messages is making youngsters' spelling better rather than worse, despite many fearing standards of literacy would plummet.

The scientists found Democrats in Congress and liberals in general used a statistically significant amount of more positive language and smiled more with their eyes in photographs, while conservatives self-reported more satisfaction with life, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Science. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.  Conservatives say they are happier, but liberals show more cheer in smiles, word choice and even emoticon use, claims a new scientific study. The researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the Congressional Record, concentrating on 2013. Democrats used 13.6 positive words for every negative and Republicans used 11.5 positive words per negative. 'We're not saying liberals are happier, they behave happier,' said study co-author Peter Ditto, a professor of psychology at the University of California Irvine. 'But conservatives report being happier.' Other studies have reported that conservatives tend to score higher on tests that rate how satisfied with life they are, but University of California Irvine graduate student Sean Wojcik, the study's lead author, decided to look deeper. He looked at other indicators of happiness: words and facial expressions. The researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the Congressional Record, concentrating on 2013. Democrats used 13.6 positive words for every negative and Republicans used 11.5 positive words per negative. That higher rate for liberals was apparent regardless of who controlled Congress or the White House, Ditto said. For a laughing Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., this rings true: 'A lot of what seems to fuel Republican energy is anger-based. They're angry about Iran. They're angry about Obama.... And you hear that on the floor constantly.' That's not the feeling at the office of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., where a sign above the congressman's door reads 'Fighting for Freedom and Having Fun.' His spokesman Ken Grubbs said, 'A day at the office here... is never without lots of laughs.' Political scientist Jack Pitney said the Wojcik study was so off kilter that it seemed to be a parody, adding 'I don't think too many people will take this seriously.' A professor at Claremont McKenna College, he had many questions about the way the study was conducted and said conservatives in general want less government so this would be reflected in the language they use when talking about government. One study team member, who initially wasn't told what the project was about, examined congressional portraits to rate their facial emotions, an accepted technique in psychology. Democrats and Republicans had similar smiles around the mouth, but the more telling features for happiness are the muscles around the eyes and there Democrats looked cheerier, Wojcik said. He also found more positive language \u2014 and emoticon use \u2014 in tweets from people who followed only Democratic Twitter accounts versus only Republican account followers. Rep.  Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., disagrees with his colleague on the other side Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who spoke against H.R. 4278, the Ukraine Support Act, during the House Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the bill on Capitol Hill in Washington.   For a laughing Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, the study rings true. Several outside psychology experts told The Associated Press that while it was interesting, they didn't find the study convincing. They faulted some techniques, did not see a significant difference between the two ideologies' scores and they criticized the researchers for mixing long-term happiness in self-reporting with momentary good moods in pictures and language.

Young people are un-tagging pictures, writing false posts and even adopting parallel identities in a bid to keep their personal information safe, according to the Market Research Society. They have even resorted to posting deliberately vague statements on their accounts - known as 'vague-booking' - to prompt real friends to respond privately for further details. Scroll down for video. Vague-booking: Young people are deliberately posting vague statements and false information in a bid to keep their personal data private, research has found. The findings contradict Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's claims in 2010 that the age of privacy is over - and no longer a'social norm'. The report, by Colin Strong of the MRS Delphi Society, says the rise of apps like Snapchat - which erases pictures after a short amount of time - show teenagers are increasingly concerned about what strangers see. His report says: 'There is an almost universally held view that teenagers simply don\u2019t care enough about online privacy.' At face value, this appears to be true, as many young people flood public social media accounts like Twitter and Instagram with endless streams of selfies and personal information. Mr Strong cites the example of Paris Brown, who was forced to resign from her position as the country's first youth police crime commissioner in 2013 after a series of ill-advised tweets she had posted years before emerged. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claimed people had become more comfortable with sharing private information online. Jane Frost, chief executive of the MRS, told The Sunday Times\u00a0that she estimates a third of Twitter users have a private account, only shared with close friends, as well as a public persona. She had many used several fake identities for things like video gaming, while closely guarding accounts made using their real names. Ms Frost said the findings will pose problems for businesses, who will not be to take consumers for granted. Mr Strong adds that just because young people post things in public forums, it does not mean have no desire for privacy. 'Just because it's in a public space doesn't mean they want publicity,' he said. His views are in stark contrast to those of Mr Zuckerberg, the chief executive of the world's biggest social network. Speaking at the Crunchie Awards in 2010, he claimed people had grown more comfortable sharing their private information online. He said: 'People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. 'That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.' He explained the rise of social media reflected the changing attitudes of people. 'When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard, the question a lot of people asked was, 'why would I want to put any information on the internet at all? Why would I want to have a website?' 'Then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way, and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information.'", "candidates": [["The Market Research Society has found that teenagers are increasingly concerned about their privacy on social media and are taking steps to safeguard their personal information.

Raid: U.S. Marshalls and sheriff's deputies are seen surrounding the home of Corey Tanner in Flager County, Florida, serving a warrant for attempted murder. Ready: Officers are heard shouting at the 24-year-old serial criminal to surrender and walk out. Officers are then heard repeatedly telling Tanner to leave the home with his hands up while getting into position, but the demands are ignored. The four youngsters said to be in the house at the time are then allowed out, leaving Tanner in the bedroom. The sheriff's department then drives a patrol round with his brother, John, in the back seat in a bid to talk Tanner out of the house without harm.

{"abstract": "Scientists have discovered that human waste contains precious metals such as gold, platinum, silver, palladium, and vanadium.

In fact as well as gold, faeces contains platinum, silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Researchers now hope to'mine' sewage reducing the need to mine raw metals from the ground, while reducing pollution by recycling human waste. Scientists have discovered a literal goldmine of precious metals in human poo.The US researchers are investigating ways of flushing out the valuable minerals, including gold, silver and rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Pictured are microscopic gold-rich and lead-rich particles in human waste. Taking a lesson from industrial mining, the scientists are experimenting with chemicals called leachates that are used to pull metals out of rock. Some of these chemicals have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment. But in controlled conditions, they could safely be used to recover metals from treated solid waste, Dr Smith claims. In the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum, silver and gold observing microscopic-sized metal particles in biosolids. Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (\u00a38.7 million) worth of metals. In 1999 the UK produced over 1,130,000 tonnes of sludge dry solids, which averages to about 20kg generated by each person. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (\u00a3510 million) a year. Dr Kathleen Smith of the US Geological Survey said: 'If you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests, and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements, that's a win-win. 'There are metals everywhere. They are in your hair care products, detergents, even nanoparticles that are put in socks to prevent bad odours.' Yet all end up at the sewage works and many metals end up in the leftover solid waste. At treatment plants, wastewater goes through a series of physical, biological and chemical processes and the end products are treated water and biosolids. In the US alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills. Dr Smith added: 'We have a two-pronged approach. 'In one part of the study, we are looking at removing some regulated metals from the biosolids that limit their use for land application. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (\u00a3510 million) a year.\u00a0Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (\u00a38.7 million) worth of metals. 'In the other part of the project, we're interested in collecting valuable metals that could be sold, including some of the more technologically important metals, such as vanadium and copper that are in cell phones, computers and alloys.' The study aims to use the same chemicals, called leachates, which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock. While some of these leachates have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment, in a controlled setting, they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste. In the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum, silver and gold observing microscopic-sized metal particles in biosolids using a scanning electron microscope. 'The gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit' meaning if that amount were in rock, it might be commercially viable to mine it. Dr Smith added that 'the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from biosolids needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.' The study presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) involved collecting samples from small towns in the Rocky Mountains, rural communities and big cities.

A retired NYPD officer vacationing in Puerto Rico with his family this weekend was swept out to sea in front of his horrified wife and children after he heroically saved a 12-year-old boy from drowning. The body of Jose 'Joe' Rosario, 47, washed ashore Monday, two days after he jumped into the water off Playa de Jobos to save his son\u2019s friend who was struggling to stay afloat in choppy waters. Rosario, a retired Manhattan police detective, was able to pull the 12-year-old to safety, but he proved no match for a powerful wave. Leisha Chen, Rosario's stepdaughter, said the boy urged his rescuer to grab onto him, but she said Rosario was afraid the child would lose his grip and go under. 'That's when another wave hit and my stepfather got pulled out further,' Chen, a married mother of one, told the New York Post. Rosario's teenage daughter, Anais, detailed in a heart-breaking Facebook post how she, her brother and their mother helplessly looked on from the beach as the 47-year-old father of three floundered in rough seas. \u2018My dad did everything he could and helped my brothers [sic] friend get out of the ocean but he couldn't get out himself,\u2019 Anais Rosario wrote. \u2018The current took him away and after a while we couldn't see him anymore. The coast guard and the cops have been looking for him since but he hasn't turned up. Family man: Rosario's family, including (L to R) daughter Anais, stepdaughter Leisha Chan, his young son and his wife, looked on in horror as the 20-year NYPD veteran floundered in the surf. Death in paradise: Rosario jumped into the water off Playa de Jobos, where the family were vacationing, to rescue his son's friend. \u2018I don't know what's going to happen and if he's still out there or not but no matter what he is a hero and always has been.\u2019 On Monday, when Mr Rosario's lifeless body turned up on the beach in Puerto Rico, his devastated daughter paid tribute to her dad in another touching post. 'Rip dad, I will love you forever and you will always be in my heart and with me wherever I go. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,\u2019 Anais wrote, expressing hope that one day they will reunite in heaven. Saturday was not the first time that Jose Rosario, a 20-year veteran of the NYPD, put himself in harm's way to save a child\u2019s life. Several years ago, the retired detective had rescued his stepdaughter's young cousin who was drowning in a pool at a Puerto Rico resort, located about a mile from the spot where he died Saturday. New York's finest: Rosario (pictured left and right with his daughter) retired from the force after serving as a detective for two decades. Noble end: Leisha Chen, pictured here on her wedding day, detailed how her stepfather (far right) was able to pull the drowning boy to safety. The child urged the father of three to grab onto him, but Rosario was afraid the 12-year-old would lose his grip. 'That's who he was,' Leisha Chen told the New York Post. 'He would give his life to anybody.' The Washingtonville Youth Football and Cheerleading League, where Rosario volunteered as an equipment director, paid tribute to the brave ex-cop Monday. \u2018Today the Wizards family has lost one of our own,\u2019 a statement from the youth league read. \u2018Joe Rosario, great father, great coach, a great man.

But in fact these ethereal photographs were taken in real life, and show extreme sportsman and climber Stephan Siegrist, 43, ascending the\u00a0Voringsfossen icefall which is part of a gigantic glacier in Eidfjord, Norway. The stunning images were captured by fellow mountaineer and photographer Thomas Senf. While the 500ft frozen waterfall is regularly scaled by climbers during daylight, he said he wanted to capture the beauty of the falls by night. Scroll down for video. Spot the climber:\u00a0Stephan Siegrist, 43, scales the\u00a0Voringsfossen icefall, a 500ft-tall frozen waterfall that forms part of a\u00a0glacier in Norway. There he is: While hundreds of climbers attempt to scale the fall during the day, few attempt it at night. With bright lights illuminating his efforts from below, Mr\u00a0Siegrist appears to be on the set of a sci-fi movie. Stunning: Mr Siegrist (pictured) trained as an apprentice carpenter before falling in love with mountaineering during a ski trip as a teenager. He gave up woodwork aged 26, and has earned his living from climbing ever since. He said: 'Photography and filming at night is a big challenge because of the lighting. The ways to play with the factors of light, time and environment fascinate me endlessly. 'I had considered for a long time how to work with artificial light, which is normally only possible in a photo studio, in major mountains. 'The transparency and reflective properties of ice in the sun had often caught my eye. With its virtually unlimited number of icefalls, Norway seemed like the perfect place to put those ideas into practice.' Climber Mr Siegrist was born in\u00a0Meikirch, Switzerland, near to Bern, which is within sight of the northern Alps. While he trained as a carpenter, he fell in love with mountaineering after a skiing trip as a teenager. Out of this world: Mr Senf (pictured bottom right in both images) was primarily a climber in the early stages of his career, but began to incorporate photography into his adventures, and took these images during one trip in 2012. Frozen solid: For a large part of the year the\u00a0Voringsfossen icefall is liquid, but during the winter months the bitterly cold air freezes it solid, allowing climbers to attempt to scale it. Aged 26 he gave up woodwork, became a professional mountain guide, and has made a living from climbing ever since. Over the course of a near 20-year career he has racked up hundreds of climbing hours, making first ascents on all seven continents. As well as ice climbing, as demonstrated in these photographs, he also specialises in big-wall climbing - scaling sheer rock faces that usually require more than one day to ascend - and bouldering - climbing without the use of safety harnesses or ropes. Meanwhile photographer Mr\u00a0Senf qualified in mechanical engineering, but moved to Switzerland aged 21 to pursue his passion for mountaineering. Adventurer: Mr Senf, who took an expedition to the icefall with Mr Siegrist in order to photograph it, is pictured left, and right during a climb. Starting out purely as a climber, he and a group of friends made two first ascents of peaks in the Himalayas, before he began incorporating photography into his adventures. He captured these stunning images of Mr Siegrist during a trip to Norway in 2012. He added: 'During the summer months, water tumbles from the cliff tops. Come winter, this majestic landscape is transformed as the waters are suspended mid-flow creating icefalls.

{"abstract": "Ramsey Nouah, a Nigerian movie superstar, has become one of the most popular names in Nollywood, Nigeria's movie industry, having starred in dozens of films and won several accolades. Nouah's latest movie, \"Thy Will Be Done,\" became last month the first Nollywood film to premiere at London's BFI IMAX, Britain's biggest cinema screen. Nouah talks about Nigeria's film industry and how it has grown over the years, the political situation in Nigeria and what he thinks about the recent security tensions, and his future plans in the industry.", "article": "(CNN)It's probably the most important advice Nigerian movie superstar Ramsey Nouah ever received: \"My friend said,\" Nouah recalls,\"'you look like a great actor, why don't you act?'\" That was some 25 years ago, when Nouah was looking for funds to cover his school examination fees. Nouah took his friend's suggestion and started auditioning for TV shows. He quickly landed a role in a successful soap opera, and soon after he made his debut in Nollywood, Nigeria's mighty movie making machine. Today, Nouah is one of the industry's most popular names, having starred in dozens of films and won several accolades. His latest movie -- \"Thy Will Be Done,\" by director Obi Emelonye -- became last month the first Nollywood film to premiere at London's BFI IMAX, Britain's biggest cinema screen. CNN's African Voices caught up with Nouah to talk about Nigeria's film industry and present him with the questions you sent via the #AskRamsey and #CNNAfrica hashtags. CNN: How have you seen Nollywood change and grow over the years? Ramsey Nouah: There have been several phases in Nollywood, like in everything in life. We started off Nollywood almost like making bread out of stone; there was nothing, no investment, no structure, nothing on the ground to actually help the industry but we've brought it this far and we are very happy. CNN: How do you see the political situation in Nigeria and what do you think about the recent security tensions? RN: I find it quite dicey, it's a case of uncertainty, not knowing what is going to happen...however I'm actually endorsing the present government because he [president Goodluck Jonathan] has contributed immensely to the growth of our industry -- call me selfish call me what but I've been in this industry for 25 years, no government ever spoke about my industry like this one. He gave us audience, he listened to us, he gave several grants to help the industry, he sent so many of the practitioners outside to big film schools... he's giving money for distribution -- so for all these reasons. There was a point where there was a nosedive, when it was hitting the rocks because it was predominantly dependent on DVDs, and the quality of the production was poor. It was successful up to a point until piracy came in and intellectual properties weren't protected and practitioners weren't getting their worth. But now there is the cinema, which is growing drastically in Nigeria and that has really helped bring back Nollywood. So I would say right now it's getting better... because cinema culture is beginning to come -- if you're going to shoot a cinema movie then you've got to be thinking about the quality of the production and of the story. CNN: So what have you learned throughout this journey? RN: I learned a whole lot of lessons, when the chips were high -- many people knew me and everything but I was so deeply passionate about the industry that I wanted growth and I wanted something better. I wanted Nollywood to look like Hollywood and Bollywood, I wanted it to have that appeal... and at some point in my industry it wasn't happening. Because I'm one of the very top actors, knowing that with my influence I could make a difference, I decided at some point... to be like \"look guys, lets upgrade, the new technologies are coming,  how do we move forward.\" Most of the people I was working with wanted to live in that mindset, and I felt \"no, I need to make a change,\"... and then I was just picking movies deliberately that I knew would stand the test of time as I grow old. Ramsey Nouah: I think my greatest inspiration is my passion for my art. My passion is my major drive, I love what I do and I like the competition, I like the circumstances that surround my industry and how to make it better -- if it was too easy and too fluid, maybe if it wasn't as challenging, my passion would have died but I think the challenges make it stronger for me. Ramsey Nouah: I'm not very certain -- I've come to learn about life that never say never.

He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. Born in 1923, Lord Bramall's father came from a merchant family in the Potteries in Staffordshire, while his mother hailed from impoverished aristocracy. She would forever call him'my baby' \u2013 even when phoning his office while he was head of the Army. He captained Eton's cricket team, had two pictures displayed at the Royal Academy, and to his mother's chagrin, turned down a place at Oxford to join the Army.

After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army.

Ismail, of Preston, had never met the 34-year-old personality but started leaving strange gifts at the studio on St Paul's Square, in Deepdale, Preston Magistrates' Court heard.

A PCSO later attended and found Ismail, and he was issued with an acceptable behaviour contract. However, on Valentine's Day this year he sent further gifts to Miss Lawler, followed by a card signed 'Ikram'.

The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation. \u2018Goodbye Wayne \u2026 good riddance,\u2019 tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: \u2018My feelings are that he\u2019s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he\u2019s cheating, good riddance.\u2019 Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: \u2018Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke.

He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells. 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago.

Sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean, altering wind patterns. While El Ni\u00f1o conditions normally bring wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer, it is unlikely to bring substantially more rainfall than this spring.", "article": "The world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited El Ni\u00f1o event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected. Scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean and have started to alter wind patterns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Ni\u00f1o will continue through the summer. The US National Oceanic and Atmosopheric Administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the Pacific Ocean (shown above) which indicates the arrival of\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o. However, they say that the El Ni\u00f1o conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and come at a time of the year when the influence of El Ni\u00f1o on weather patterns usually declines. This means that while El Ni\u00f1o conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer, it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring. El Ni\u00f1o is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. Usually the wind blows strongly from east to west, due to the rotation of the Earth, causing water to pile up in the western part of the Pacific. This pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific. However, in an El Ni\u00f1o, the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east. This causes the eastern Pacific to get warmer. But as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents, this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer, meaning the El Ni\u00f1o grows. This change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere. The NOAA said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting California. Some meteorologists, however, have warned that this El Ni\u00f1o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Ni\u00f1o to increase global temperatures. Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre, said: 'Based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure, we can now say that El Ni\u00f1o is here. 'Many climate prediction models show this weak El Ni\u00f1o continuing into summer.' The arrival of this El Ni\u00f1o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year, but the conditions failed to materialise. According to the Met Office El Ni\u00f1o conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to Europe during the Autumn and colder winter temperatures. The above diagram shows the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean on 25 Feburary 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average (marked by red) on that date. It can also make sourthern Europe wetter during the late summer and autumn. Perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east Asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in El Ni\u00f1o years. El Ni\u00f1o is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet. It is the result of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the Pacific Ocean. This cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years. When the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months, the NOAA officially classes it as El Ni\u00f1o conditions. California is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the Stevens Creek Reservoir (shown above). It is unlikely the El Ni\u00f1o will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought. The last El Ni\u00f1o, in 2009-2010, was a moderate to strong event. This brought freezing  weather to northern Europe in the winter of 2009/2010 and the UK was exceptionally cold. The Vancouver Winter Olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event. Other recent El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s \u00a0in 2002-2003,  2004-2005 and 2006-2007 have been weak to moderate in strength. The last very strong El Nino was 1997-1998 and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the United States, especially California. The NOAA said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean has been above average. They also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern Pacific ocean. In Late January and February there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical Pacific and forecasts for March suggest these will continue. The NOAA said that this mean the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index, which is uses to monitor the El Ni\u00f1o, has been a negative value", "candidates": [["The world is experiencing a long-awaited El Ni\u00f1o event that could alter global weather patterns, but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected.

On the move: The 44-year-old actor was seen dressed in layers as he walked through the airport. Work ahead: Jon had a guest starring role on Tina Fey's Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

Falcao struck twice in four minutes for Colombia's second and third goals in a 6-0 thrashing of the world No 103-ranked side at the Bahrain National Stadium. The 29-year-old has been craving regular football having not started for his club since February 28 but delivered as he so often has for national team head coach Jose Pekerman. Radamel Falcao celebrates the second of his two goals for Colombia in their friendly against Bahrain. Out-of-favour Manchester United striker watches his first strike, a classy  volley, hit the bottom corner. 1 Arnoldo Iguaran 24 goals in 68 games. 2 Radamel Falcao 23 in 55. 3 Faustino Asprilla 20 in 57. 4 Freddy Rincon 17 in 84. 5 V\u00edctor Aristizabal 15 in 66. 6 Teofilo Gutierrez 14 in 37. Adolfo Valencia 14 in 37. 8 Ivan Valenciano 13 in 29. Antony de Avila 13 in 54. 10 James Rodriguez 12 in 32. Willington Jose Ortiz 12 in 49. First though, Falcao was the provider for  fellow striker Carlos Bacca to open the scoring on 14 minutes after Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado hit the post early on. Showing strength at the back post Falcao headed back to Bacca at the top of the six-yard box for the Sevilla marksman to drill home the finish. Captain Falcao then stepped up in the 32nd minute to get himself on the scoresheet with a clinical left-footed volley after a looping ball over the top of the flagging Bahrain defence. Falcao's second came moments later, again with a first-time finish, but this time after his explosive run between defenders was met with a well-weighted through ball. The strike, which it must be said took a significant deflection, took Falcao's international tally to 23 in 55 matches, just one short of his country's all-time top-scorer Arnoldo Iguaran's 24 from 68. Carlos Bacca drills home Colombia's first goal after a strong header from Falcao set him up. Falcao pierces through the hapless Bahraini defence on Thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time. Defender Abdulla Khaled Al-Haza'a brings down Falcao wide on the right during their friendly. After the break Borussia Dortmund's Adrian Ramos came on to add his second goal in as many international showings after a deft pass from Inter Milan's Fredy Guarin for 4-0. After Pekerman decided his star man had had enough after 72 minutes, Real Valladolid's Johan Mojica and Mexico-based Andres Renteria came off the bench to continue his work with goals five and six respectively to wrap up the mismatch. Despite his personal tally getting a boost, Falcao made a point to commend his team's effort after the match. 'Great victory today against Bahrain,' he wrote on his Instagram page. 'The most important think, the amazing team work!!! Go Colombia.' Falcao has scored just four times in 22 appearances since coming to Old Trafford on loan from Monaco and is almost certain to go elsewhere in the summer. Colombia's Andres Renteria, who plays for Santos Laguna in Mexico, beats\u00a0Said Ahmad Jaffer for the sixth. Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado shoots in Colombia's 6-0 win at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa. Bahrain keeper Sayed Mohammad Jafar makes himself big as Falcao comes close for a third. Colombia enjoy support away from home in Bahrain as they continue preparations for the Copa America. But with some sharp running and eagle eye for goal - at least twice - he showed glimpses of the reasons why the club thought him worthy of \u00a3260,000-a-week for this season. He should have left the pitch with a hat-trick, to be fair, with a golden chance at the far post on 49 minutes squandered following a poor Bahraini clearance from a free-kick. Falcao's last goal for Van Gaal's side came on January 31 when he scored United's second in a 3-1 defeat of Leicester. His most recently involvement under Van Gaal has been minimal - as an 83rd minute substitute in wins against Liverpool and Tottenham after being hooked after 68 minutes with United 1-0 up against Sunderland - as the Dutchman puts his faith in Wayne Rooney with support from Danny Welbeck and Juan Mata in the absence of Robin Van Persie.

The news came as a shock to his neighbours, who remembered him as an innocent-looking 12-year-old boy obsessed with Manchester United. Menacing: A masked Raphael Hostey, 22, brandishes AK47s in a photo on Twitter while wearing a floppy hat. Fresh faced: Hostey was remembered by his neighbours in Moss Side, Manchester, as an innocent boy. Just a few years later he would shun his British upbringing and leave his wife and child to join IS. Posting raps about jihad on Twitter, he has urged young women considering joining IS to 'come as soon as possible'.

Hostey left behind a wife and child to travel to the country in 2013 with two friends, Mohammed Javeed and Khalil Raoufi, both 20. All three were students at Liverpool John Moores University. Javeed and Raoufi are thought to have died in fighting. Hostey, from Moss Side in Manchester, is known among jihadis for his afro hairdo. Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure many more British recruits to IS, including jihadi brides. In raps posted on Twitter, he has urged video game-loving followers to stop playing 'Call of Duty and Fifa' and come 'to the khalifa' (or head of a Muslim state).

Hostey was injured in fighting but has not come home and still brags of his exploits on social media sites. On Tumblr he told 'a sister in London' to contact him privately when she asked for advice on life under IS. Born Raphel Saiho Hostey, he preferred to be known by the more anglicised name Raphael.

The prosecution has previously said that a marijuana cigarette was found near Lloyd's body, which was discovered in an industrial park near Hernandez's home.", "article": "Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez's DNA matched genetic material found on a cigarette butt at the scene of a murder, a crime lab scientist testified on Friday. Hernandez is on trial for murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd's body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home, and prosecutors have said previously a marijuana cigarette was found near his bullet-riddled body. Former Pats player Aaron Hernandez sits in court during his murder trial on Thursday in Fall River, Massachusetts. A crime lab scientist testified today that his DNA matched DNA found on a cigarette butt at the crime scene. Diane Fife Biagiotti of the state police crime lab told jurors that she received rolling paper from a 2-inch-long cigarette butt to test for DNA. She said she found it had the DNA of at least two people on it. She said she first compared it with Lloyd's DNA and discovered he could have been one of the people whose DNA appeared on the butt. She said she then was able to use Lloyd's DNA to deduce the second DNA contributor. 'I did a comparison between the profile I deduced and the profile of Aaron Hernandez,' she said. 'I found that the profile from Aaron Hernandez matched the deduced DNA profile.' She then ran a statistical analysis and determined the likelihood it was someone else is one in more than a quadrillion. 'How many zeros does a quadrillion have?' prosecutor William McCauley asked her? 'One with 15 zeros after it,' she replied. He then asked her the world's population: 7 billion - and pointed out a quadrillion is one million times a quadrillion. But Hernandez lawyer James Sultan went after other DNA evidence in the case, including some collected from a spent shell casing found inside a car Hernandez rented. All smiles: Shayanna Jenkins, fiancee of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, leaves the courthouse during his murder trial on Friday. Police found the casing in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car, stuck to some blue bubble gum. An Enterprise employee said she found both items under the driver's seat of the car and threw them away. Biagiotti testified she found Hernandez DNA on the shell casing, but she also acknowledged she did not know the gum had been stuck to the shell before she did her test. 'Would you agree with me, Ms. Biagiotti, that there is a high likelihood that the DNA contained in the saliva on a chewed blue chewing gum would be transferred to that shell casing?' Sultan asked. 'Yes, I would agree with that,' she said. She also acknowledged that it is uncommon to find a testable amount of DNA on a spent cartridge casing and that the lab had never tested the chewing gum for DNA. Sultan also asked her if she had received a DNA profile for Hernandez co-defendant Ernest Wallace to compare it with evidence in the case. She said she had not. Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, listens during his murder trial on Friday. Also listen, at left, is Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee. Wallace and another man, Carlos Ortiz, have also been charged in the killing. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The court heard on Thursday that a tread mark found near the body of a man allegedly killed by Aaron Hernandez was made by a tire from a car rented by the ex-NFL star. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Todd Girouard, who specializes in tire track analysis, said the rear passenger side tire of a Nissan Altima that prosecutors say was rented by Hernandez matched a track found at a North Attleboro industrial park where the body of Odin Lloyd was found in June 2013. Ursula Ward, mother of victim Odin Lloyd, listens during the trial. Girouard, the state police trooper, said four small stones lodged in the tire of the Altima corresponded to tracks from the industrial park, based on his analysis, which included comparing photographs and test prints of the tire. He said the believed the tire on the Altima'made the impression.' Lloyd's sister testified earlier she saw her brother getting into a silver Nissan outside their home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood hours before he was killed. Prosecutors have shown surveillance video of Hernandez and Ortiz getting out of a silver Altima at a gas station in Canton, Massachusetts, hours before the murder. Also on Thursday, Patrick Quinn, a T-Mobile engineer, identified the locations of cell towers that connected with Lloyd's phone, beginning in Boston and moving to the coverage area of the North Attleborough industrial area, in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013. Earlier, Carol Martin Bailey, a resident of a condominium complex where Hernandez rented a unit in Franklin, Massachusetts, said she met a man she identified as George who appeared to be Ernest Wallace. The man told her he was moving into the next door unit with his cousin, she said, describing him as 'extremely nice'.

He believes his slavish devotion to studying what\u2019s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top. Gordon is hoping to celebrate his first showcase occasion since Hearts earned cup glory in 2006.", "article": "The interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans. Simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak. For Craig Gordon, the old wisdom \u2013 fail to prepare, then prepare to fail \u2013 is more a way of life than a fleeting thought. To the uninitiated, tomorrow\u2019s final will be settled over 90, maybe 120 minutes, with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon is fully focused  ahead of the Scottish League Cup Final with Dundee Utd. But, long before the first ball is kicked in earnest, the Celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits. While much of what will transpire between Celtic and Dundee United will be random and instinctive, Gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what\u2019s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top. \u2018Every game,\u2019 he replied when asked how frequently he\u2019d dip into video analysis. \u2018Free kicks, penalties, the way strikers like to finish the ball, how they strike the ball. \u2018I just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what\u2019s their favourite side. Notes are taken on different players so I know. All of that stuff. Gordon  fails to hold the ball allowing Rodrigo Palacio of Inter Milan to score in the Europa League. \u2018It\u2019s about taking that research out on the training pitch, too, and practicing for who you\u2019re going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low, early crosses into the box, for example. \u2018For the Rangers game, it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that. That played out during the game too as I was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off. Between all of us we come up with a plan for the game.\u2019 And when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet? Gordon will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since\u00a0Hearts earned cup glory in 2006. \u2018Absolutely, it\u2019s satisfying,\u2019 Gordon added. \u2018It becomes a team effort with Woodsy (Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach) and the video analysis guys to ensure we\u2019re as well prepared as possible. And that\u2019s not just me - John Collins does it with midfielders and defenders, so it\u2019s preparation. \u2018What we\u2019re trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we\u2019re coming up against.\u2019 Celtic have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach. Nine years ago, Gordon played in the Scottish Cup Final for Hearts against Gretna \u2013 his last major final as it would transpire. Few neutral observers fancied the Borderers to go the distance that day but they did just that. Gordon\u2019s intervention in the final chapter was key, however. As Hearts hit four perfect kicks, he saved from Derek Townsley before watching Gavin Skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top. Celtic goalkeeper Gordon celebrates their goal during the Scottish Premiership match against Aberdeen. \u2018I had a fair idea of most of the Gretna penalty takers,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018I had seen penalties from them. Most were from memory. With penalties, nowadays everyone does their homework.\u2019 That stop from 12 yards not only allowed Gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers Scotland has produced. When a \u00a39million move to Sunderland was completed a year later, it seemed he\u2019d spend half his life on the winner\u2019s podium. Little did he realise at the time, how unique those scenes of celebration would prove. A year ago, with the road back from injury seemingly never ending, the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful. \u2018I probably didn\u2019t appreciate at the time like I should have done - playing in a cup final, winning a cup,\u2019 he reflected. Celtic keeper Gordon speaks with referee Craig Thomson after the Scottish Cup quarter final. \u2018Albeit it\u2019s a different competition this Sunday but it\u2019s still to win a cup, I probably did think it would come around again, that I\u2019d get another chance. \u2018I haven\u2019t been close until now so I\u2019m going to enjoy this one a little bit more, but then I\u2019ll only really enjoy it if we win the match. \u2018It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll look back on fondly if we don\u2019t.

'He\u2019s been a very good father, stepfather and partner to me. He\u2019s the only person who\u2019s ever always been right in my corner. On the day we married he told me, in the car, I will never let you down. That was a vow. And he never has. We\u2019ve had our moments \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be normal if we hadn\u2019t \u2013 but we\u2019re very solid.' But life's not always glamorous in the Britton-Vickery household.\u00a0Fern says: 'I rarely have make-up on when I\u2019m at home. I\u2019m at the Co-op, I\u2019m on the school run, or walking in the woods with Phil and the dog \u2013 that\u2019s real life. Phil is a very handsome man, but at home, he walks around mostly just in his pants, without having shaved for a few days! I\u2019m not in the club of people who care about these things \u2013 I just don\u2019t care. Fern and Phil, 53, have one daughter, Winnie, 13, and Phil is a stepfather to Fern's other children, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18..

The teenager said he had known he was gay'since fifth grade', but had been worried about coming out publicly - particularly because his relationship with his father had been 'rocky for a long time'. 'I had a feeling he wasn't going to like it. But I had to tell him. I couldn't keep it anymore,' he said.

Christopher Purdy, the clinic's president and founder, said he was inspired to start Carafem after working more than a decade promoting family planning and HIV prevention in developing countries. Carafem president and founder Christopher Purdy (pictured with health services vice president Melissa S. Grant) has begun a new Washington, D.C. abortion clinic that presents itself with a'spa-like feel' It was there he realized how much easier it was to get an abortion, sometimes as simple as walking into a pharmacy, in places such as Ethiopia. Meanwhile, in the United States more than 200 laws have restricted the controversial procedure and forced dozens of clinics to close their doors, according to the Washington Post. Melissa S. Grant, Carafem's health services vice president, said  it was important for the clinic 'to try and present an upgrade, almost spa-like feel'. The clinic will also only provide pharmaceutical abortions, meaning there will be no vacuum aspiration or surgical procedures available - this means that Carafem's clients cannot be more than 10 weeks pregnant. Purdy told the Washington Post that not purchasing surgical equipment allows him to charge $400 for the procedure, which is about $100 less than the average pharmaceutical abortion. The clinic offers fluffy robes, natural wood floors and tea on arrival, in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure. Clients who walk into Carafem will receive counseling and go through 'basic tests' before they take the initial pill at the clinic. The whole appointment is supposed to take about 60 minutes. The second set of pills, which induces the abortion, is then taken at home the next day. On it's website, Carafem says it's staff provides 'clear, non-judgmental and accurate information so you feel confident'. 'We are an experienced team with years of experience in abortion care,' it states. Purdy said the clinic plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word.' Anti-abortion activists don't believe Carafem's bold take is going to work. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion lobbying group the Susan B. Anthony List, believes the approach is too celebratory. She said she believes even people who are pro-choice think of the procedure as 'a necessary evil'. National Right to Life President Carol Tobias believes people will find Carafem disgusting. 'Abortion is not pleasant, and trying to put pretty wrappings around the procedure isn't going to make any difference,' she said. Purdy said the clinic, which he described as 'fresh, modern, clean and caring', plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word' Carafem's founders aren't the only people speaking publicly and positively about abortion. A number of female Democratic lawmakers have shared their personal experiences to put a human face on the procedure and protest anti-abortion legislation. Last week Ohio Democrat Rep. Teresa Fedor revealed during a debate in the House that she had terminated a pregnancy after being raped while serving in the military and became pregnant. 'You don't respect my reason, my rape, my abortion,' she said as representatives debated the state's Heartbeat Bill, which would make it a felony for doctors to provide abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected.

Rakeim had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture, and his mental state seriously deteriorated after his Uncle Danny, Pat's son, had died five years earlier. Despite the family's worries about Rakeim, they were unable to help him, and his paranoia increased as he dabbled more in drugs.", "article": "The knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear. For one mother though, the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother. In 2008, Franky Regan Lamb faced the news that her 21-year-old son Rakeim Regan had fatally stabbed her mother, Pat Regan,  in her own home, in Leeds. Scroll down for video. In a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, Franky Regan Lamb has spoken out about the horrifying incident in 2008 when her son, Rakeim Regan, murdered her mother Pat. Now in a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, which aired yesterday on the CI channel, Franky, her brother Shane and their friends have spoken out about the horrific incident which will haunt the family forever. Rakeim, who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture, killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis. His mental state seriously deteriorated after his Uncle Danny - Pat's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene. Rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that Danny, a notorious drug dealer, might be a bad influence on him. Danny, who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm, was shot to death in 2002, following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs. Following her son's death Pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and, according to Franky, had a close relationship with Rakeim. Murdered Pat Regan (right) was an anti-gun campaigner, pictured here with fellow campaigner Michelle Forbes outside  Downing Street in 2008. Slain uncle: Pat's son Danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs. She said: 'If he was in trouble, he'd go to my mum\u00a0probably\u00a0more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better. He was her grandson - they were just really close.' Despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about Rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence. His uncle Shane admitted: 'We had worries about him, because it seemed that he was impressed with, kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff. 'You know, there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just, kind of like, saying, \"You don't need to be focused on that kind of stuff. You need to focus more on your education, your music\" - you know, things that are quite playful, things that are positive. 'Don't look at the negative and don't be, you know, tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle.' Sadly, there was nothing the family could do to help him and as Rakeim started to dabble more and more in drugs, his paranoia started to increase. Franky said: 'He kind of lost his way a little bit and I, kind of, guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years, in ecstasy, cocaine, and I used to say to Rakeim, \"You haven't got the mind-set to get through stuff like that, you know, take ecstasy and things like that. It's not good for you and it'll bring you down.\" 'He would go, \"I know mum, I don't do it any more.\"' Rakeim's uncle Shane Regan showed off a selection of pictures of his mother. He says he has not been to see his nephew since he fatally stabbed his mother. Shane said: 'He was having thoughts of people turning into reptiles, aliens, he was having these kinds of thoughts. 'People's eye colours were changing, you know, to these luminous colours. He threatened my brother to say that he was going to stab him in his neck. 'It was like he was almost possessed with something that he wanted to be. He wanted to be a hard man, he wanted to be tough, he wanted to be fearless. 'He wanted to be this character that wasn't him and my mum was like, \"Well, I let him go out tonight, god knows what's going to happen to him.\"' Finally - following an incident in which Rakeim was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital. It was to prove too little, too late. The day after his release Pat, who had taken Rakeim in, went missing. She was meant to attend an anti-gun event being hosted by Shane but the alarm was raised when she failed to show up.

Brennan announced the restructuring to the CIA workforce Friday. He said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency's management structure, including what deputy CIA director David Cohen called 'pain points,' organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently. Briefing reporters with Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering. He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world. Not your grandparents' CIA: The CIA\u00a0is launching one of the biggest reorganizations in its history, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into intelligence gathering. Critical look: CIA Director John Brennan\u00a0said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering. 'There are a lot of areas that I would like to have better insight to, better information about, better access to,' Brennan said. 'Safe havens, denied areas.  Whether because we don't even have a diplomatic presence in a country, or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others.' On the cyber front, the CIA chief said he is establishing a new 'Directorate of Digital Innovation' to lead the agency's efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology. US officials said that Brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive. Historically, electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the US government. But the CIA felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological 'pace of change,' as one official put it. Brennan said the new digital directorate will have equal status within the agency with four other directorates which have existed for years. 'Our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging' in today's digital world, Brennan said. 'And so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we\u2019re able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment.' Pitfall: Evidence shows that the CIA may have taken too long to find and kill Osama bin Laden - a mission that was accomplished in 2011 after a decade-long manhunt. Brennan avoided the term 'cyber,' a word used by the National Security Agency, the country's premier digital spying service. The changes come against a backdrop of widespread concern that the CIA's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the September 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the Cold War. The CIA, along with other US intelligence agencies, wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of Middle East governments during the Arab Spring in 2011, among other shortcomings. The agency's greatest public success of recent years \u2014 the 10-year effort to locate and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011 \u2014 may have taken longer than it should have, according to evidence made public in the recent Senate report on CIA interrogations.  Internal CIA surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency. In the most significant departure, the CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms, a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses, in different offices, than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers. The new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world. There are a handful of such centers at the moment, including the Counter Terrorism Center, where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-Qaida with espionage and drone strikes. Under the new plan, each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction, including covert operations, spying, analysis, liaison with foreign partners and logistics. The system of CIA stations, headed by a CIA station chief, will remain in place, Brennan said. Most stations are in US embassies, and various CIA case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers. The changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the CIA's current budget, CIA officials said. Critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts, who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake. It may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally, the theory goes.

Jurors also got a chance to see jihadist files. recovered from his laptop. The bomb, described as similar to the twin bombs set off at. the race, was extracted from a Honda Civic in which it embedded. itself on a Watertown, Massachusetts street after Dzhokhar. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, detonated it during. the gunfight. The pressure cooker was the same type as was used in the. bombs that killed three people and injured 264 on April 15,. 2013, said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Brian. Corcoran, though the pieces found in Watertown were more intact. than those discovered at the race's finish line. The Boston bombing jury was shown images of a pressure cooker bomb that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly threw at police during a shootout in the neighborhood on Watertown. The pressure cooker bomb in Watertown was lodged into a Honda and was more intact than the two found at the Boston Marathon finish line. The lid of the device landed two houses away, in a local child's hockey goal. Pieces of the bomb shrapnel were found on nearby roofs, lawns, and lodged in the siding of homes up to a block away. A piece of shrapnel metal seen above with BBs stuck to it on the street where the Tsarnaev's threw pipe bombs and a pressure-cooker bomb, on the left. On the right, a remnant of the bottom of the Watertown pressure-cooker bomb. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston. 'Those pieces were typically more fragmented, more cut up,' Corcoran testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, looking at. both the main pot and its lid, which was found halfway down the. block from the blast site, in a child-sized soccer goal in a. home's side yard. 'This was a better representation of the. pressure cooker as a whole.' Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is. convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and. shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he. and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston. The Watertown gunfight in the early hours of April 19, 2013. ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hopped into a black Mercedes and. attempted to run over three police officers who were trying to. arrest Tamerlan. The officers jumped out of the way but Dzhokhar. ran over his brother, who was briefly caught up in the vehicle's. wheels and dragged. Tsarnaev's lawyers opened the trial early this month by. bluntly admitting he carried out the bombing and shooting. Their. goal is to convince the jury that the plot was driven by. Tamerlan, with Dzhokhar a junior partner in the scheme. Proving. that could persuade the jury to sentence the younger brother to. life in prison without possibility of parole, rather than death. Tsarnaev (left) pictured in court on Thursday as an expert testifies about the jihadi propaganda found on his laptop. Tsarnaev casually leans on his hand during his death penalty trial on Thursday, March 19. The jury was also shown images of a Samsung laptop, which was found in Watertown along with Tamerlan's high school diploma. Several jihadist materials were found on Dzhokhar's laptop and orange flash drive, including an article on how to make homemade bombs. Another FBI agent testified that investigators recovered. several apparently jihadist documents on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's. laptop, including at least three copies of Al Qaeda's 'Inspire' magazine, one featuring a cover story headlined 'Make a Bomb in. the Kitchen of Your Mom,' and another brochure-type document. titled 'Jihad and the Effects of Intention Upon It.'

A Parish councillor  has won a \u00a3400 payout from Thomas Cook after booking what he thought was a'relaxing holiday' to a Greek party island where he was housed with 'boozed up' youngsters at a Club 18-30 hotel. John Moore, 56, from Herne in Kent, planned to spend a week on the island of Zante with his partner Angela, 51, in September. Rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for, the couple, who run a sweet shop in Herne Bay, Kent, \u00a0were booked into Christina Studios in the resort of Laganas in Zante, advertised as an 18-30 clubbing destination. After spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were 'banging on the walls and screaming and shouting', the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet. They have since been awarded \u00a3400 in compensation by the holiday company. While being advertised by Club 18-30, Christina Studios is described on the Thomas Cook website as 'one of the best chill-out zones' in Zante. Upon their arrival however Mr Moore found 'boozed up' youngsters who 'didn't seem to sleep'. 'When we got there I asked the rep if he really thought I would book an 18-30 holiday,' the Parish councillor said. 'When I go on holiday I don't care really where it is, I want to just have a good time but it wasn't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people. 'It was an official 18-30 resort. It was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting, so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking.' After complaining to the Thomas Cook rep at the resort, the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the \u00a3600 they had already spent. They would also have no other choice but to go to another Club 18-30, said Mr Moore. 'We were just speechless really, it wasn't what we wanted or what we were expecting and Angela was horrified.' While the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with 'rowdy' youngsters, they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel's treatment towards them. 'The apartments didn't have hot water but when I complained the owner used very, very rude language.' At that Mr Moore and his partner packed their things immediately and, they say, waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation. Eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the UK. Mr Moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act, and was recently offered \u00a3400 after requesting a summons from a judge. The hotel where Mr Moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the Laganas strip (above), hailed as one of Zante's biggest nightlife spots. The 56-year-old Parish councillor said Christina Studios (above) where he was placed was 'packed with youngsters' who'screamed and banged on walls' 'I'm not surprised at all (that they've offered me money), they didn't have a leg to stand on,' he said, speaking of the offer. 'They sent us to an 18-30s hotel having seen how old we looked.' Among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns: 'Don't bother if you are over thirty as it's too noisy.' The apartments are a five minute walk from the Laganas strip, described by Thomas Cook as Zante's 'party resort' whose nightlife is 'in the same league as Ibiza'. But Mr Moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday, with the resort also described as suitable for family trips. Among TripAdvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as 'filthy' and 'noisy'. One positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the 'ultimate' place for a boys or girls' holiday. Thomas Cook apologised for the couple's experience in September.
