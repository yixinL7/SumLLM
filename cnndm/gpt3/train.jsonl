He then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers for \u00a350,000. Kostrzewa was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police.", "article": "Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files. A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for \u00a350,000, a court heard today. Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer\u2019s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard. They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer\u2019s door to complain about noise - but he became \u2018infatuated\u2019 with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as \u2018spy games\u2019, \u2018spies\u2019 and \u2018secret documents\u2019 - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took \u2018sensitive or secret material\u2019 and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent. Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive. The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines. Base: Mr Spencer is an engineer on submarines in the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told. Mr Spencer\u2019s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was \u2018infatuated with Shane\u2019. Mr Chalk said: \u2018He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.\u2019 That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen. Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa\u2019s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying \u2018you reject me, you reject me\u2019. The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour\u2019s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had \u2018lost\u2019 Mr Spencer. Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told the Polish man took'sensitive or secret material' and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Miss Berriman also found that she had lost her key to her boyfriend\u2019s flat and Kostrzewa let her into the shared entrance - and then allegedly said he had found her key on the floor of a Co-op store. She was surprised that the key had fallen off the tight-fitting keyring. In the covert recording with the agent Alex, the defendant allegedly said he had \u2018acquired keys to Shane Spencer\u2019s flat\u2019. Mr Chalk said on various dates in March 2014, Kostrzewa used search engines on his computer, entering words including \u2018spy games, secret documents, spies, consulate Republic of Poland\u2019. Mr Spencer went to Gibraltar to work from March 19 to 25. The prosecutor said: \u2018He then offered to sell off the documents relating to UK submarines to the Polish government.\u2019 In April agent Alex rang the Pole and they met on April 10 in Plymouth, going to a hotel room which was rigged up with hidden recording gear. He allegedly said he found a key to access the flat and stole the relevant papers and planned to copy Mr Spencer\u2019s hard drive - and wanted \u00a350,000 for the information. Alex said he 'needed time to consider the documents'. In the recorded conversation, the defendant said \u2018this is only the beginning\u2019.

The Englishman escaped a red card after referee Craig Thomson sent off team-mate Paul Paton instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final. That decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on Wednesday, when Celtic will also challenge the red administered to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. Celtic have slammed the SFA\u2019s decision to let Dundee United's Calum Butcher play in the League Cup final. Celtic will challenge the red shown to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. United\u2019s Nadir Ciftci \u2013 already banned from the Hampden showpiece \u2013 faces a further two-match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at Parkhead skipper Scott Brown. But Celtic are furious that Butcher will be free to play in the final, even if Paton is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice. A club statement read: \u2018It seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that, in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed, the Dundee United player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer \u2013 and would be available to play in the League Cup Final and the Scottish Cup replay between the teams \u2013 while Celtic\u2019s player (van Dijk) may potentially miss both of those matches. \u2018Celtic and Virgil van Dijk maintain their position that no red-card offence was committed by Virgil. Virgil will appear at Hampden to put his case on Thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal.\u2019 United refused to comment publicly on Tuesday night, but are privately furious at some of Celtic\u2019s comments. Brown, meanwhile, has escaped retrospective punishment for his tackle on Ciftci. The United striker lashed out in retaliation at the Scotland midfielder before van Dijk and United\u2019s Paton were controversially dismissed by Thomson on the advice of assistant Graham Chambers. Celtic's Scott Brown  accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head. There will be no SFA action against Tannadice winger Aiden Connolly, however, despite claims by Celtic the youngster dived to win a penalty in the Scottish Cup stalemate. Expressing relief that Brown has been cleared to play on Sunday, team-mate Stefan Johansen said the SFA had reached the right decision in that regard. \u2018I saw the tackle from Broony,\u2019 said the Norwegian. \u2018It was just a tackle and everything else was just a lot of players around it. \u2018He would have been a big loss - but I didn\u2019t think that was going to happen. He is the captain and means a lot to the team. We could see how important he is to the team when he was out at the start of the season. He\u2019s a great player and a fantastic captain. He gives it out but he takes it back. That is part of his game. It\u2019s not only him in this league who makes hard tackles.\u2019 The failure to penalise Brown\u2019s challenge was blamed by United boss Jackie McNamara for sparking the incident which saw Ciftci lash out with his boot. Offered a fast-track two-match ban by the SFA compliance officer, Ciftci has until 3pm today to respond to the complaint. If he declines, a Fast Track Tribunal will convene tomorrow. Failure to win his appeal would see the striker miss the Scottish Cup replay with Celtic and the subsequent Premiership clash between the sides. Despite rising tensions, Johansen believes the League Cup final will not go the same way as the Scottish Cup tie \u2013 which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period. \u2018It was a weird game, with three red cards and two penalties,\u2019 he said. \u2018It affects the game, of course, but I think it will be different this time. I don\u2019 t think what happened on Sunday will affect the final. It\u2019s a new game and a trophy is at stake for the winners. \u2018I am just focusing on ourselves. If we go out and play the way we can then we have a great chance.\u2019"}

Patricia Baines failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986. Officers found \u00a36,000 of the cash hidden in the 62-year-old's shed during a police search, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Baines, of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, on Friday after pleading guilty to theft earlier this year. An investigation is now under way to establish where the rest of the money is.

Justin Wigoder, prosecuting, said the defendant's father  received the pension under the Nottinghamshire Local Pension Scheme. His wife then claimed a widow's pension until her death, when Baines should have alerted the authorities. Mr Wigoder said Baines abused a position of trust. He said: 'The pension should have ceased. This defendant did not notify Nottinghamshire local government of her mother's death and she carried on receiving over 17 years.' Digby Johnson, defending, said Baines was of good character. He added that she recently let the Salvation Army into her life to help. Recorder David Chinery told Nottingham Crown Court he took of account her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold.

Even for breast cancer \u2013 one of the most treatable forms of the disease \u2013 the figures are still well below those reached by France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s. For lung cancer, the rates are so far behind that patients in Britain are now half as likely to survive as those living in Austria. Macmillan Cancer Support has described the situation as \u2018shameful\u2019 and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in Europe. Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the UK's survival rates (file picture, posed by models) And despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years \u2013 \u00a3640million invested by Labour in the early 2000s and \u00a3750million by the Tories \u2013 Britain does not appear to have gained any ground. In 2002 Labour increased National Insurance tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then Chancellor Gordon Brown specifically to pay for major improvements in the NHS, notably cancer care. But only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by MPs warned of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 variation in care. Data analysed by Macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in Britain survive five years. This is a lower rate than France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s, when the figure was 83 per cent. In these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher. For bowel cancer, 54 per cent of Britons can expect to survive five years, whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in Finland and 55 per cent in Norway, the Netherlands and France. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries, including Austria, Germany and Italy, it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u2018Frankly, this is shameful. What we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable. \u2018If countries like Sweden, France, Finland and Austria can achieve these rates, then the UK can, and should, bridge the gap.\u2019 Experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough, before it has spread to other organs. It may also be down to patients not being offered the newest, most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures, which are routinely available in other countries. This is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail. Experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the NHS cannot cope with the ever-increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer. It is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes. The figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of European countries carried out by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, known as the \u2018Concord programme\u2019. Meanwhile, the latest monthly NHS statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as X-rays, CT scans or ultrasounds \u2013 up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since February 2008. It follows a report by MPs warning of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and \u2018unexplained\u2019 variation in cancer detection and treatment across England \u2013 particularly for the elderly. Sean Duffy, of NHS England, said: \u2018We are diagnosing and treating more people than ever before and as a result the NHS is helping more people than ever survive cancer.\u2019"}

She recommends showering before shaving to hydrate the hair and reduce the force needed to cut it. Scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin.", "article": "When it comes to shaving, boys are normally taught the art by their fathers or older brothers. But this means bad habits can also be passed down through generations. Now a principal scientist from Gillette has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave, why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink. She also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain. Scroll down for video. Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns in diameter (left) but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. Washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said Gillette principal scientist Kristina Vanoosthuyze. Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze has worked in the Gillette Shaving Technology area at the Innovation Centre in Reading for the past nine years. Every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses, high-speed  cameras and special high-intensity lighting. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair, and in the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade   pulls the hair up,  the second cuts it, the third blade acts in a similar way to the first, and so on. In some of their products, Gillette also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades. This footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair. Every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high-speed cameras. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair. In the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade pulls the hair up, the second cuts it, the third blade pulls and so on. When hydrated, skin is also tighter (an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right). This exposes more of the hair's surface area to the blade. \u00a0As a result Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round. This image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin. Dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut.\u00a0Additionally, the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving glide. Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. This increases the surface area that the blades can cut through, and when hydrated, skin is plumper, which reveals more of the hair. Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull:\u00a0The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave:\u00a0This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. As a result it makes more sense to shower before shaving and not the other way round. 'Allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut,' explained Dr Vanoosthuyze. 'In fact, dry hair can have the strength of copper wire. When hair hydrates, it swells and becomes easier to cut. 'So, men should wash the face and neck with a mild cleanser before the shave. Or at least take a shower before the shave and not the other way around. 'Additionally, the lubricating ingredients formulated in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience.' Scanning electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin, for example. On the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg, while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top. The hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust. The skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on"}

The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal shot at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent. The year nine student then underwent emergency brain surgery for 'potentially fatal' injuries after fragments of skull went into the teenager's brain. A top grammar school has been fined \u00a310,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries.\u00a0The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal ball at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent. The boy, who was formerly a keen rugby player, has been told he will never play again. The victim had been part of a class of 24 Year nine pupils taking part in a multi-sports PE lesson on June 20 last year hugely over-subscribed grammar school. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. The pupil suffered a severely fractured skull and was rushed to Kings College Hospital in London. He was due to have an operation to alleviate the swelling in his brain but it was decided the surgery could have worsened his condition. A few days later his condition deteriorated and he underwent emergency brain surgery to remove fluid from the brain. The school's governing body was hauled in front of Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court today charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. Prosecuting, Kevin Golding said: 'It's unclear what the long term impact will be. 'He has recovered sufficiently to return to school but we don't yet know the long term impact on his memory, intellect, mood, personality and his future employment prospects.' The court heard the teacher in charge, David Joseph, has taught at Judd for 10 years, and has been a teacher for 28 years overall. He was in the centre of the sports field overlooking the javelin throwing pupils when the incident happened. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle, the court heard. He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit the victim on the head. Defending, Dominic Adamson said that although the boy's injuries were the result of an unfortunate accident, the health and safety procedures in place were not conducive to a serious risk of it happening. The court heard the victim was a very keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed rugby. Because of the injuries he sustained and the indentation to his skull, it was said that he will never play again. Mr Golding said: 'The victim was seriously injured and fortunate not to have suffered fatal injuries. 'He has sadly suffered life changing injuries which could have been avoided. 'He was a very keen sportsman, particularly his love of rugby, and the damage and indentation he still has at the base of his skull means he can't play rugby anymore. 'He and his family have endured a difficult nine months and face more difficult times ahead.' Chair of the bench Nick Bensted-Smith said the victim had suffered a'very serious and devastating injury' as a result of the incident and the school received a fine of \u00a310,000, legal costs of \u00a31,375 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120.

The teacher is not facing any disciplinary action by the school and has not been charged with any criminal offences. The Judd School pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to ensure that a child in their care was, so far as is reasonably practicable, not exposed to risks to their health or safety. They suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place.

The judge made the girls wards of court, preventing them from leaving the UK, and removed their passports and those of adults involved in their care. The ruling comes after authorities have been making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people from travelling to areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants.", "article": "Five teenage girls who showed 'an interest' in travelling to Syria have been barred by a High Court judge from travelling abroad. Mr Justice Hayden today made the two 15-year-olds and three 16-year-olds wards of court - a move which prevents them from leaving the jurisdiction of England and Wales. He made the ruling at a hearing at the High Court after Tower Hamlets local authority raised concerns. The five girls were made wards of court, which prevents them from leaving the UK. Mr Justice Hayden made the ruling today at the High Court (pictured) after hearing the girls had'shown an interest' in travelling to Syria. The judge, who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from Tower Hamlets in East London, also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care. He said the ban was a \u00a0'draconian' step, as was the removal of the passport. Mr Justice Hayden told the hearing: 'But the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in Syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely. 'As I said early this week in another case, and I repeat it in this, sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people, ultimately from themselves. The judge said the ban was a 'draconian' step, but necessary to protect the girls. Pictured: Aleppo, Syria. 'Therefore I am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought.' The girls and adults concerned, who were not in court today, can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish. The judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family. He also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services, and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position. 'It seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls.' Authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants. The ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16-year-old boy from Brighton from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. The judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region. Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February. Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting. Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales. In February Sharmeena Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. All four schoolgirls attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. Sharmeena is now living in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride and told her father she will never come home."}

Scroll down for video. During a 12-year long search to find his birth parents, Aaron Levi (left), 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player, Wilt Chamberlain, is his father. But Chamberlain, who died in 1999, claimed that he would never have a child. The 7'1' star, who once scored 100 points in one game, boasted about having slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above.\u00a0He worked out he slept with, on average, 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Even though the 7'1' star claimed he slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above, he maintained until he died in 1999 that he did not have any children. Chamberlain, who once scored 100 points in one game, worked out he slept with on average 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Levi, who stands at 6'5' tall, said that had he known the San Francisco Warrior  player was his father 20 years ago, when Chamberlain was still alive, his life would have been completely different. Born in 1965, Levi was raised in Oregon by adoptive parents Don and Harriet, and only knew very few details about his birth parents growing up. 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, said she met Chamberlain at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out with him a few nights later. She said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment, and that night Levi was conceived. He began the search for them in 2003 and got closer to answers after collecting background information  in 2004. The information, which is believed to be provided entirely by Elizabeth, said that Levi's mother was a white woman of English-French descent; while details of his father included that he was was a black professional basketball player who was 6'10', born in Kansas and held a Masters degree. However, the details did not exactly match with those of Chamberlain: the NBA star was from Philadelphia and attended the University of Kansas for only three years without obtaining a degree. As he continued to search for more answers, in 2009, Levi received a birth certificate with Elizabeth's name and was eventually connected with her. He said: 'It's been a burden on me to feel that I am her secret, and I am Wilt's secret, and I am the Chamberlain family's secret. 'That's been hard for me...I already know what's going to happen if I don't do anything. I'm going to have an unfinished journey.' After a more than hour-long conversation, she revealed the details of her 'casual relationship' with Chamberlain. Elizabeth said they met at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out a few nights later, when she said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment. When Chamberlain learned of the news that Elizabeth was pregnant, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' That night, she conceived Levi and five months later told him she was pregnant and had plans to give the child up for adoption. When Chamberlain learned of the news, he  chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' Levi has tried to reach out to some of Chamberlain's relatives who remain closed to meeting him and refuse to participate in DNA tests because they feel doubts surround his claim. In his continued mission of self-discovery, he hopes to inspire other people who have been adopted to begin their searches earlier than he did. Levi and Elizabeth met in person in 2010, where they had different feelings about Chamberlin, and spent time together again in England last Fall. He said: 'I wanted her to tell me something good about him, but that wasn't going to happen. I realized that we had different feelings about him. 'She sees him as a womanizer...to me, he's my father.'"}

Education secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered an urgent investigation into the school after it emerged two dead Islamist fighters were also taught at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London. Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia. Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers. Ministers have ordered an urgent investigation into the school attended by Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) after it emerged two dead extremist fighters \u00a0- including Choukri Ellekhlifi (right) - were also taught there. Yesterday the Government announced an urgent internal review into whether enough had been done at the school. Mrs Morgan has ordered officials to examine all evidence, including school records and inspection findings, to establish whether enough was done to prevent teenagers becoming radicalised. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming  extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern', a spokesman said. The spokesman added:\u00a0'The Secretary of State has asked them to review all schools that fit this category. 'Our understanding of the challenge, and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely in the past few years. Quintin Kynaston Academy's (pictured) head insisted the school is 'not a breeding ground for terrorists' 'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.' The Telegraph reports both Ellekhlifli and Sakr were 'close associates' of Emwazi. Ellekhlifi was fighting alongside al-Qaeda linked extremists in Syria when he was killed by government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11, 2013.

Quintin Kynaston Academy's current headteacher has insisted the school is not a breeding ground for terrorists. Alex Atherton told The Telegraph: 'QK has been proactive in working with the government's Prevent strategy, and this has resulted in positive work around the well-being and safety of our students. 'Students that may have attended nine years ago are not a reflection of the students we are proud of having at QK, and we will continue to put in place support mechanisms to make sure all our students feel safe and that they can raise any concerns.'

He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, he assesses McLaren's troubled start to the season and the disappointing curtain raiser in Melbourne. John Watson (right) pictured last year with Sir Jackie Stewart, Karun Chandhok and Damon Hill. McLaren have moved from Mercedes engines to Honda and it is a bit like any relationship; it takes time. Formula One has gone down the route of trying to cut costs, and as a result, we have seen a substantial cut in track testing which will hinder McLaren's chances of improving this term. I would like to see teams allowed to test more simply because I think the public is beginning to wonder what we\u2019re watching. Are we seeing an exercise in extremely high-level technical games or are we looking at Formula One as an entertainment and sport? What is Formula One's objective? And where does it see itself going? I understand that TV viewing figures in Germany for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix were down nearly 50 per cent  on the norm and I don\u2019t think that is very good sign. Lewis Hamilton won the season-opening race in Australia ahead of \u00a0Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton led from start-to-finish as Mercedes dominated the first race of the new Formula One season. Maybe in Britain it wasn\u2019t so bad because of Lewis Hamilton's recent success, but there is a downside to domination, and we saw that at the turn of the century with Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, and then with four years of Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel. My big concern, and I hope I am not being over-reactionary here, is that there are so many teams in the pit-lane that are struggling financially. Giedo van der Garde's legal case against Sauber in Melbourne was hugely embarrassing and dominated the agenda at the Australian Grand Prix. It is systematic of where Formula One is right now. Driver talent is clearly secondary to budgets, albeit with a few exceptions at the sharp end of the grid. Teams desperately need funding. My other worry is whether global companies are looking at F1 as a sport which they want to commit to. I don\u2019t see any substantial company coming in as a title sponsor to any team. Hamilton is bidding to become the first British driver to win consecutive Formula One world championships. Pastor Maldonado crashed on the opening lap while Lotus team-mate Romain Grosjean retired moments later. The sport, whether it is the governing body, the FIA or CVC, Formula One\u2019s commercial rulers, need to sit down and say \"what are we doing?\" \"what are we trying to achieve?\" and \"are we achieving it?\" Last year we did have some good races, but I don\u2019t want to see another grand prix like Melbourne where at the end of the opening lap we had effectively just 13 cars running. Manor didn't get out of their garage. Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat suffered mechanical gremlins on their way to the grid. And both Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado failed to complete a lap. It is not acceptable. Formula One let itself down and it is a shame because the opening round of the championship, particularly with Melbourne being the sporting capital of the world, had a poor race. In the case of both McLaren and Honda, make no mistake, the achievement of getting back to the top as quickly as possible is absolutely paramount. They are a team who have won multiple world championships, but the last two years have been their worst since 1981. But I am confident they know what they have got to do, and they have put steps in place to rectify their problems. Jenson Button finished in last place, and two laps down on race winner Hamilton at the 2015 curtain-raiser. Kevin Magnussen, who deputised for Fernando Alonso, waves to the crowd ahead of the race in Melbourne. This year there is a four-engine limit for the entire season. So, combine that with the limited testing, and restrictions on engines, and how are engine manufacturers, particularly somebody coming into this Formula, such as Honda, expected to catch up, let alone match, those who started last year? Mercedes began their programme way back in 2011 and what you are seeing is the culmination of a lot of work which was done parallel to the team competing in 2012 and 2013. Renault were distracted with winning titles with Vettel and Red Bull while Ferrari didn't appear to grasp what was required. That is fundamentally why Mercedes hold the advantage. They had the wisdom to start out ahead of the game. Honda are having to play catch-up in public which is painful for them and McLaren. When you go through the design, manufacturing and development"}

The cabin has been nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture-Mies van de Rohe Award.", "article": "Perched atop Norway's snowy Seven Mountains sits the stunning Tubakuba cabin. But the off-the-grid property, made of glass and wood, isn't just known for it's sweeping views of the city of Bergen below. In order to reach the small architectural marvel, guests are required to crawl through its tunnel-like entryway, which remarkably resembles an otherworldly black hole. High above the city of Bergen in Norway sits the Tubakuba cabin, which boasts a very unusual, vortex-like entryway. Made up entirely of glass and wood, staying overnight in the cabin is free for families with young children. Designed as part of a workshop at the Bergen School of Architecture, OPA Form Architect, Espen Folgero was the mastermind behind the striking cabin. It's name is inspired by the tuba, thanks in large part to its curved entryway that opens like a vortex to the woods outside. The interior is made of plywood, while the exterior is crafted from burnt larch that has been treated with a traditional Japanese method called Shou Sugi Ban to prevent fungal decay. It's the portal-like entrance that's really something special, however, made up of curved shavings of pine and untreated larch, which will turn gray with time. The interior is made of plywood and has floor to ceiling windows along one side to allow guests to experience the breathtaking views. There is no electricity and the cabin's amenities are basic with only a wooden stove, bare wooden platforms and lofted sleeping space. To reach the inside of the 14-square-metre cabin, everyone must crawl through the house's 'black hole' tunnel entrance. Best of all, for families with young children, it's free to stay overnight in the playful space. The 14-square-metre cabin offers basic amenities, such as a wood stove, bare wooden platforms and a lofted sleeping area. There's no electricity, but the property is so small that it doesn't require much heating. And it's the view that guests truly stop by for: large windows overlooking the rocky mountainside give visitors the impression that they are 'floating' above the valley below. Every detail of the tunnel was considered, right down to the the use of untreated larch wood, which will turn grey with time. These drawings show exactly how the architecture students envisioned guests relaxing in the lofted sleeping spaces. Referred to as a 'wooden bubble,' the property has since been nominated for a European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture. Sketching was an important part of the students' learning process and helped them identify structural problems and solutions. The tuba-like tunnel is not just a way to reach the cabin's interior, it's also a play space in and of itself for children if the hut is closed. Speaking to Fast Company, architect Espen Folgero explained the concept behind the avant garde house. 'The entrance is shaped like a mouth of a tuba to experiment with wood as a material, to give children a place to play even if the hut is closed, and to force adults to crouch to get in, even if kids don't have to,' he said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Tubakuba has been nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture-Mies van de Rohe Award."}

In her early twenties Marika Magriplis, from Sydney, used to be too small for an Australian dress size six while working in a corporate job and living off a diet of convenience food including noodles and cheap burgers. Today - after overhauling her diet and lifestyle in 2010 - she\u2019s just two weeks from giving birth to her first child and credits exercise and nutrient-rich meals with her 'having nothing to whinge about while pregnant\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been lucky with my diet and lifestyle but I\u2019ve got away with very minimal side effects with this pregnancy,\u2019 Marika told Daily Mail Australia. Her feet \u2018only swelled up once\u2019 and instead of wishing to indulge in sweat treats her only craving has been \u2018tuna with vinegar\u2019. Scroll down for video. 'In the last week he has had another spurt... 22 days to go':\u00a0Marika Magriplis, who is nine months pregnant (left), has credited working out (right) with keeping nasty pregnancy side effects at bay. The 29-year-old, a qualified personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, ditched her unhealthy lifestyle in 2010. Since 2012, when she first began competing in bodybuilding competitions around Australia, Marika has spent six days of the week weight training and eating a protein-rich diet. After becoming pregnant she adapted her training, with the help of experts, by reducing her weight sessions each trimester and including more calorie-dense foods into her diet to feed her growing bump. \u2018My training became more about core strengthening than building,\u2019 Marika said. \u2018Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off. At one stage \u2013 about halfway through my pregnancy I had really bad back pain because I made the weights too light - my body needed the strength,\u2019 she explained. However, now with just 14 days until her due date Marika has stopped weight-lifting altogether as she prepares to become a mum. Marika explained that she has kept up weights during pregnancy to maintain strength, not to build muscle like before. Marika's amazing transformation from a tiny 39 kilos to a strong bodybuilder came after she began lifting weights and learning about nutrition. \u2018Physically I\u2019ve made peace and listen to my body now and I\u2019ve dropped back on the training side of things. Now it\u2019s a about prenatal yoga and a lot of stretching and preparing the body for birth.\u2019 Marika, who is now a qualified personal trainer, weighed 39 kilos in 2007 after graduating from uni. \u2018I was tiny just through lack of knowledge\u2026 health wasn\u2019t a priority it was just about making money,\u2019 she explained. When she was competing as a bodybuilder before she was pregnant, Marika's daily diet would include:. Morning. An omelette with two whole eggs and three egg whites with cucumber or broccoli or green beans on the side. 'Its sounds odd for breakfast but it has everything you need, essential fats and fibre  from the veg and protein from the egg whites,' Marika said. Lunch. Fish or chicken, basically a lean white protein, with some salad and some nuts. Snack. Greek yoghurt (around 150 grams) with a handful of nuts and some protein powder. Dinner. White or sweet potato with meat and veg. 'I would have carbs after weight training. It breaks all the rules but if you think about your body as a machine, you need to refuel and  carbs work as energy. 'If you have fats in the morning, keeping them separately for different needs,' Marika explained. Exercise. Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding. After weights she would have a banana and a protein shake. On day seven Marika would balance weights with a slow walk along the beaches near her home. This was her 'active recovery day'. Marika said one of her favourite core exercises before she was pregnant was 'hanging leg raises'.

Critics of the fixed-term parliaments legislation argue that it is a recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings.", "article": "The London Mayor said it would be 'fatal' for the Tories to give any suggestion of a fresh power-sharing deal. David Cameron should rule out coalition with any other party after the general election, according to Boris Johnson. The London Mayor suggests it would be 'fatal' for the Conservative Party to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power-sharing deal with the Liberal Democrats or another smaller party. 'We should say \"stuff coalition with anyone\",' Mr Johnson told the Daily Mail. 'We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. 'If we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party, it would be absolutely fatal.' Asked whether the Prime Minister should rule out a second coalition altogether, Mr Johnson replied: 'Yes. Otherwise people don't know what they are voting for.' Lord Steel says there is no appetite among Liberal Democrats for another coalition \u2013 or among the two big parties. 'A lot of David Cameron's Tories want a Tory-only government, even if it's a minority one, and similarly on the Labour side,' the former Liberal leader told the BBC. 'I suspect \u2013 if you have to look into the crystal ball \u2013 that we're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament, which is something new, and they'll be able to play one off against the other.' He said the most that Lib Dems would countenance in another hung parliament would be a 'confidence and supply deal', where they agreed to support a larger party in key votes but did not enter a formal coalition or take ministerial jobs. He also said that his party needed to'recharge its values'. Mr Johnson, who is Mr Cameron's chief leadership rival, criticised the fixed-term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition \u2013 suggesting it should be repealed. 'The sooner it expires, the better. I always thought it was some bit of Lib Dem nonsense,' he said. 'Constitutionally the thing we need to address is the rank injustice that it takes so many thousands more votes to elect a Conservative rather than Labour MP. It's an absolute scandal.' Former Conservative minister Sir Alan Duncan has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed-term legislation, branding it a'recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings'. Labour's Jack Straw and Tory Kenneth Clarke support the move. Critics say five years is too long, risking a 'zombie parliament' in the final year. Few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election. Boris Johnson - considered Mr Cameron's main rival for the Tory leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election. It means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the Queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable. Instead, they need to win the support of a'supermajority' of two thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period. This means the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents. The only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no-confidence. But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. A new coalition could therefore take power without an election. Critics say the legislation is a recipe for never-ending power-sharing."}

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the battle took place between the Firetown and the 623 gangs who joined forces to confront another unnamed rival group. An imitation firearm was fired in the air by a 16-year-old who then pointed the weapon at another of the girls while Connor Chambers, 17, was seen waving a knife at a rival. The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19. The schoolboy fled into the foyer of the Britannia Hotel where he was involved in a scuffle and was later found to have suffered a stab wound to the chest that required five stitches.

Randy Lerner, pictured in 2011, is speaking to a consortium over a proposed \u00a3150million sale of Aston Villa. Talks over a takeover are understood to be at an advanced stage and Lerner\u2019s decision to fly into England is viewed as a key step towards the completion of a deal. The consortium is in the due diligence stage of their proposed takeover, though the eventual price of the sale will depend on which league Villa are playing in next season. Christian Benteke is pictured scoring for Aston Villa in their 4-0 thumping of Sunderland last month. Lerner wants to receive his full \u00a3150m asking price. Lerner\u2019s expected arrival in the Midlands comes after it emerged Lerner\u2019s Midlands property has been made available as part of the takeover. The farmhouse, located in Bodymoor Heath, is understood to be worth in the region of \u00a33m. Lerner has been keen to sell Villa for some time, a period that has seen the club go through a difficult period on the pitch. The sacking of Paul Lambert and subsequent arrival of Tim Sherwood has helped stimulate the club, as has their pending FA Cup semi-final. But Villa are still in danger of dropping into the second tier of English football for the first time since 1987. Lerner is desperate for the team to avoid that scenario as he looks to receive his full \u00a3150m asking price.

Tribunal chairman, Ian Callinan QC, ruled that the Sharks board failed to allow the 29-year-old footballer due process before severing his contract. This came after a photograph of the player urinating into his own mouth went viral on social media last June. Mr Carney's contract was torn up after a photo emerged of the player urinating in his own mouth. The committee\u2019s findings state that the former Dally M medallist should have been allowed an opportunity to plead his case in front of the Cronulla board. Cronulla Sharks chairman Damien Keough said the club will respect the decision made by the appeals committee, adding it is their responsibility to follow correct procedure. \u201cThe big oversight was that someone needed to check that the process being followed was correct,\u2019\u2019 Keogh told The Telegraph. Mr Carney's agent claims the photo was a set up and 'an optical illusion' \u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember here is that it\u2019s not a question of the facts, it\u2019s a question of the process, but the reality of the situation is, the decision would likely have been the same. He said he wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of the former Origin player returning to the league but 'there has been a lot of water that has flown under the bridge since last June.' There's no denying Mr Carney is a talented player, however, his antics off the field have led to the termination of three contracts. The Daily Mail Australia reached out to the Cronulla Sharks however they declined to comment. Mr Carney is currently in France nursing broken ribs, sustaining the injury in only his second game for the English Super League Club Catalans. After what most believed was ultimately the end of the troubled player's career, the five-eighth may surprise us all by staging a return to the league. The disgraced player fled to France to pick up the pieces of his damaged career where he sustained a rib injury. As Cronulla is the third team to terminate a contract with the fallen star, the question remains, which team would be game to pick up the controversial player? Paul Gallen has spoken out on Triple M Radio saying he thinks Mr Carney should allowed to return to the league however he would need a strict contract to curb his bad behaviour. \u2018If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life,\u2019 says Paul Gallen. \u2018If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life.\u2019 Rumours are flying on Twitter that the Manly Sea Eagles might be in the market for a five-eighth after the Kieran Foran announced he would be moving to Parramatta in the 2016 season. Rumours are starting to circulate about the former Cronulla player's options for the 2016 season. Alternately, the ruling now gives Mr Carney the option of perusing legal action against the club by filing an unfair dismissal claim with the Industrial Relations Commission."}

For 18 months the couple, said to be worth a combined \u00a3210million, have spent \u00a35million improving the palatial west London  home -\u00a0an inner-city replacement for their sprawling Hertfordshire estate 'Beckingham Palace'. But at least one neighbour is upset about plans to install air conditioning in five rooms, including in the new gym and wine cellar. Moving in: The Beckhams are spending \u00a35million on building work before they move into their new London home, pictured, but a neighbour has complained over plans to install air conditioning. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria\u2019s shoe collection. Portfolio: The couple, pictured together at a charity dinner, have applied for planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence after they sold Beckingham Palace in Hertfordshire - they already have homes in California, France and Dubai. One resident has written to the local council and said he 'totally disagrees' with the plans, which 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. MailOnline understands that the complainant is worried about air conditioning units being attached to the mansion, because of the visual impact and the humming noise. His letter said: 'The council must identifed (sic) our deep concerns about all adverse impacts on living conditions from noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from construction and from associated traffic, in addition to concerns about impacts on drainage, on appearance and landscape, on structural stability, and on historic buildings.' The Beckhams have hired designer Rose Uniacke to oversee the project and plans for 'internal alterations at all levels' were approved in February this year. This included the enlargement of the lower ground floor wine cellar and the installation of a retractable cinema screen. They also want to re-configure two bathrooms while removing a third-floor guest bathroom to form an extended bedroom and sitting room. When ready, the  home will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room. The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria\u2019s shoe collection. Staff and security will have access to a tunnel which will take them unseen to a second property. The couple have already installed a sound system so that music can be played in every room, and which can be controlled by a phone or computer. They are planning on adding specially designed waterproof plasma TVs in every bathroom. Their children Brooklyn, 16; Romeo, 12; Cruz, ten; and daughter Harper, three, will take over the second floor of the house which has three bedrooms, all with en-suite bathrooms.

Particulars: These photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show the mansion needs refurbishing since it was last updated in the 1990s. The lower ground floor includes a study, a gym and massage room, three service rooms and a small garden and there is an underground garage where David can keep his fleet of cars. David and Victoria reportedly sold their Hertfordshire home, known as Beckingham Palace, for \u00a312million. However, they also own homes in California, Dubai and a \u00a32.6million holiday home in the South of France. The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate just three months after their wedding in 1999 for \u00a32.5million.

{"abstract": "France has recently approved a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die, which has sparked debate among doctors, religious leaders, and pro-euthanasia campaigners. The bill has been backed by the Socialist government and would also force doctors to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves. In northern Belgium, the acceptance of euthanasia has greatly increased since it was legalised in 2002, with 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in 2007 increasing to 4.6 percent in 2013.", "article": "France is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die. The bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide, but would give people 'the right to deep, continuous sedation until death'. This must be at the patient's request, but only when their condition is life-threatening in the short-term. Protests: Demonstrators gather near the French National Assembly holding white silhouettes as part of a silent protest against euthanasia in Paris on March 10. Slogans read: 'Let's relieve but do not kill' On March 10. pro-euthanasia demonstrators held signs reading: 'Francois let's act like Holland'. Euthanasia has been taking place in Holland for many years. The proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in France's lower house of Parliament, and it must now be debated by the Senate. Backed by the Socialist government, the bill would also force doctors in France to follow end-of-life instructions expressed by the patients themselves, or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes. Almost one in 20 people in northern Belgium died using euthanasia in 2013, more than doubling the numbers in six years, a study released today showed. The universities of Ghent and Brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002, the acceptance of ending a life at the patient's request has greatly increased. While a 2007 survey showed 1.9 percent of deaths from euthanasia in the region, the figure was 4.6 percent in 2013. 'Euthanasia has been increasingly accepted by the patients as a valid option at the end of their life,' said Ghent University ethics professor Freddy Mortier. 'Physicians themselves are more inclined to comply with the wishes of the patients.\" Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Earlier this month in a speech at France's lower house of Parliament, Prime minister Manuel Valls praised 'a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully, in dignity and without suffering'. The bill has stirred debate in France and prompted a call for the preservation of 'the prohibition of killing' by five high-profile Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. It has prompted protests by those claiming the bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, as well as pro-euthanasia campaigners who believe it does not go far enough. Doctors are also divided about the idea. So-called terminal or 'palliative sedation' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses, or until they starve. The method does not actively kill patients, but some doctors say it can mean patients are sedated for weeks before they die, and that it may be more humane to euthanise. French debate over end-of-life legislation resurfaced last year over the case of comatose Frenchman Vincent Lambert. His wife wants doctors to stop life support but his parents disagree. The case is pending at the European Court of Human Rights. Some protesters claim the new bill amounts to disguised euthanasia, while others say it doesn't go far enough."}

Jean and Joy Taylor were born in the house in Ryde, Isle of Wight, in 1916 and 1922, never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until Jean's death in 2008. Now their quiet, old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer Zoe Barker, with her picture series, The House Of Two Sisters. Scroll down for video. The sisters' guest room is decorated with pink candlewick bedspreads, an electric fire and family pictures on the mantelpiece. Jean's picture is in the centre, to  the right is their brother Jim in his Royal Artillery Uniform. The new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a 'cool cupbord' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese, butter and eggs. Jean Taylor (left) was born, lived and died in her home in Ryde, Isle of Wight; after the loss of her sister in 2008,  Joy, now 99, (right) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home. Barker's pictures are as much a document of the sisters' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing Britain. Her images  record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs, tins of treacle in the kitchen, a dressing table and highly-patterned carpets. There are no computers cluttering up surfaces, or plugs, wires and cables wending around furniture  and only a few black and white photographs  decorate on the walls. The women were born into a well-known local family, which originally set up a successful coaching business in the town in the 1840s. They also had two brothers James and John. Barker said: 'Very much a family home in the early days, the sisters shared the house with their mother and their Aunt Edie until both mother and aunt passed away. This was Jean's home all her life.' Aged 23 and 17 respectively when the Second World War broke out, the Taylor sisters came of age in an era of thrift, rationing and self-sacrifice.\u00a0And their wartime experiences are evident throughout the house.

The  picture on the wall is of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who was never found after bailing out over the sea near Dunkirk. Both of their brothers survived the war and there is a picture of James, who served in North Africa and Italy while John fought in the jungles of Burma, on the guest bedroom mantelpiece. In their neat, almost spartan, room is a black and white photo of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who victory-rolled over the house whenever he flew over the island. On 4 June, 1941, he was seen to bail out over the sea near Dunkirk but was never found. The smaller photograph in the corner of the same frame is Bill Tudhope, a bomber pilot who was engaged to one of their cousins. He failed to return from a bombing mission over Germany in 1940. Barker said: 'In 1957 Joy left to live in London, though returned to the house almost every weekend. On retiring in 1981 she returned to live with her sister and they remained there together until Jean's death. 'Neither of them ever married. Despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until Jean passed away.'

Britain had been working with America on developing laser weapons since the 1970s, and the Soviets were said to be developing their own beam weapons. The laser weapon was never used in action during the war, which lasted from April to June 1982 and resulted in the loss of 255 personnel from the UK.", "article": "Margaret Thatcher is said to have ordered testing of a laser to be used in the Falklands War. A secret 'death ray' laser was developed during the Falklands War and ordered for testing by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, documents reveal. Britain was said to have worked with America to develop the high powered lasers for use on the battlefield during the 1970s and 1980s. The beam, nicknamed a 'death ray', had been developed quickly because of fears over the weapons possessed by the Soviets - but was never used. But Lady Thatcher was said to be so impressed with the technology she ordered testing to take place during the Falklands War, the Daily Express reported. Existence of the laser was revealed in the National Archives, in a letter - marked 'top secret' from the then Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine to Lady Thatcher in 1983 about the weapons owned by the Soviets and Britain's position. It said: 'You may recall that we developed and deployed with great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low-flying Argentinian pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic. 'The weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted circle.' The letter was revealed under the 30 year rule. Sheffield academic Dr David Clarke found the letter in his search of the archives and said the 'naval laser weapon' referred to a device tested, but never used in anger, when troops were defending the Suez Canal in 1941. Margaret Thatcher (pictured front, centre) visited HMS Hermes when it came back from the Falklands War. This device used powerful searchlights to dazzle pilots as they attacked Royal Navy ships. In 1982, when the Falkland Islands was invaded, it was decided to use the same tactics to try and blind enemy pilots. In the 1980s Britain was said to be focused on developing\u00a0medium power lasers directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes, optic and electro-optic sensors. These weapons was designed to target low flying aircraft by 'dazzling' pilots targeting ships. The 'death ray' was said to be unlikely to be unsuccessful in targeting ships but would work on humans. Britain's laser weapon research in the 1980s was covered by two programmes - known as Raker and Shingle. According to the correspondence from Mr Heseltine, Britain had been working with America on developing laser weapons since the 1970s. Mr Heseltine also detailed fears in his letter to Lady Thatcher about the Soviets were developing a range of secret beam weapons. However he said he was uncertain whether owning these weapons was useful. In the letter he added:\u00a0'the Russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid-1980s (in fact, the Russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser Kirov)'.

The scheme was hailed as a massive boost for first-time buyers, amid claims it could cut the average time taken to save for a deposit by up to a year. David Hollingworth, director at brokers London & Country, said: \u2018This is basically free money. \u2018It will help combat the issue which really affects first-time buyers who complain that they cannot save as quick as house prices are rising. \u2018It is quite a large perk the Government is paying.\u2019 The average UK first-time buyer currently pays around \u00a3150,000 for a home, putting down an average deposit of \u00a325,000, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

Belle Gibson: Doubt has been cast on the Whole Pantry founder's stories as people demand answers from the health guru. Doting young mum: Ms Gibson has expressed concern about her family's safety after her son's childcare details were allegedly placed online. Ms Gibson's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. The Instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis, saying she would 'have a statement live this week' where she would address medical questions. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook.

The app gained popularity after Ms Gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life. But after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims, Ms Gibson herself admitted in an interview with The Australian that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver, spleen, blood and uterus was a'misdiagnosis'. Ms Gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her Instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the Whole Pantry Facebook page deleted.

The technology giant did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Tuesday. She said the social media accounts were 'further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data, information or other security-sensitive content to be shared or made light of. 'My son's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this, so I'm sure you can understand how unnecessary, concerning and threatening that is.'

The home improvement chain  is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Shares in Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Changes: B&Q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Parent company Kingfisher, which also owns Screwfix, plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360-strong B&Q estate. The move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to \u00a3675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to \u00a311billion in the year to January 31. This is down from 744million in the 2013-14 year. The planned store closures form part of a plan by new Chief Executive Veronique Laury to shake-up the 360-store B&Q business. Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds  in the year to January 31.The results are the first to be presented by Laury, who succeeded Ian Cheshire in December. Veronique Laury said the closure plan was one of a number of'sharp' decisions being taken by the FTSE 100 company. She added: 'Home improvement is a great market with huge potential and Kingfisher has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way. However, it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential.' Other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company, particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of Kingfisher's operating companies. The company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities. Kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the B&Q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the Screwfix brand, while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business. Ms Laury denied that the UK DIY market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company's UK offer. She added that it had long been clear that B&Q had too many stores in its estate. B&Q UK & Ireland's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to \u00a33.7 billion in the financial year, with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent. Profits were 16 per cent higher at \u00a3276million. In contrast, profits in France were 12 per cent lower at \u00a3349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market. Kingfisher said it will close a small number of stores in the country. It came as Kingfisher, which had a binding agreement to buy French rival Mr Bricolage, was forced to pull out of the \u00a3200m deal. The acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because Kingfisher already owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. While it had the backing of a key shareholder, support was withdrawn by franchisee group the Association Nationale des Promoteurs du Faites Le Vous-M\u00eame (ANPF), which holds a 42pc stake in Mr Bricolage. Forty-four of Mr Bricolage's 500 stores, many of them franchises, would had to have been sold to placate regulators. It has since emerged that today was the deadline for the deal and all parties had to agree if there was an extension."}

In addition,\u00a0Hillary Schwartz, an assistant director on the film, was also convicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing and also received 10 years probation. Charges against Miller's wife and business partner, Jody Savin, were dropped as part of his plea. Prosecutors said all three defendants knew that CSX Transportation, which owned the trestle spanning the Altamaha River, had denied them permission in writing to film on its tracks. 'It was a horrible tragedy that will haunt me forever,' Miller said in a statement provided by a publicist. 'Although I relied on my team, it is ultimately my responsibility and was my decision to shoot the scripted scene that caused this tragedy.' Hurt (above) won the Best Actor Oscar in 1986 for Kiss of the Spider Woman. Assistant District Attorney John B. Johnson said Miller and the other filmmakers even attempted to rewrite the script to drop the scene they planned to shoot with actor William Hurt, in the role of Allman, in a hospital bed placed on the tracks. Miller decided to shoot the scene anyway, Johnson said, after the owner of the property surrounding the tracks said the movie crew could access its land. He said Miller and his crew went onto the railroad bridge after mistakenly thinking no more trains would pass that day. The train, traveling at 55mph, smashed into a metal-framed bed on the tracks, sending shrapnel flying as crew members scrambled for safety and clung to the bridge's metal railing high above the Altamaha River. After his plea was accepted, Miller followed a sheriff's deputy from the courtroom to begin his two-year sentence at the Wayne County jail. He also agreed to serve an additional eight years on probation and pay a $20,000 fine. Miller's attorney, Ed Garland, said he expects the director could be released from jail within a year. He said Miller accepted the plea deal to prevent prosecution of his wife, who left the courthouse in tears. Garland said the filmmaker never intended to put his crew at risk.

Together, Asian and Formosan subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. The Formosan termites originated in China but now are established throughout the Southeast and blamed for roughly $300m in property damage each year in New Orleans alone. Asian termites normally found in tropical south-eastern Asia have spread to Brazil, the Caribbean and south Florida. Asian termites are not expected to spread farther north in the US than south Florida because they do not tolerate colder weather/. However, a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone. Their habitat ranges overlap in lush south Florida, already home to a daunting number of invasive plant and animal species thriving where they should not. Each termite invaded Florida several decades ago, but experts believed the colonies didn't mingle because their above ground mating swarms launched in different months. That is, until University of Florida researcher Thomas Chouvenc noticed something unusual about the termite swarms in his Fort Lauderdale neighbourhood two years ago. The two species were flying around looking for mates at the same time \u2013 and they were giving each other that look. The research is preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered, but the idea of a hybrid termite carrying the destructive capabilities of two invasive species worries experts. 'That's big news,' said Matthew Messenger, an entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture. 'They're two bad ones, too.' Chouvenc is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal Plos One detailing observations of Asian and Formosan termite swarms in downtown Fort Lauderdale. In the field, including Chouvenc's own yard, researchers documented the two species swarming at the same time and in the same places. The same behaviour was documented again last year, and Chouvenc said he is seeing again this spring. 'What we didn't expect to see was when they're in the same place at the same time, we saw the male Asian subterranean termites looking for the female Formosan termites in the field,' Chouvenc said. Together, Asian and Formosan (pictured) subterranean termites, are responsible for much of the estimated $40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually. 'When we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab, to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing.' The resulting 'hybrid' colony in the lab grew more vigorously than colonies produced by either species alone, researchers said. Genetic analysis confirmed they were looking at a hybrid species. Similar hybridisation has been documented in invasive bee and fire ant species, but not in termites. The two termite species also are found together on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and in Taiwan, but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in Florida appear to be a new phenomenon. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale, or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce. It is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in Fort Lauderdale in the south of Florida. Female termites can lay millions of eggs, but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms. 'Let's keep our fingers crossed that they're not able [to reproduce] and that they're donkey termites,' said Messenger, who reviewed the data but did not participate in the University of Florida study. Even if hybrid termites cannot reproduce, they could cause damage over many years. Alone, each species is a challenge to control. Their below-ground colonies are bigger than those of native termites and can be hard to find. Liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against Asian and Formosan termites, and those methods should work against any hybrid, Messenger said. The termite species are found together on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and in Taiwan, but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in Florida appear to be a new phenomenon.

{"abstract": "The women's liberation movement had a significant impact on the food that was served in family dinners. In the 1950s, households were rationed to one egg per week, leading to the use of dried eggs and blancmange for cakes.

Food historian Dr Polly Russell told today's This Morning that in the Fifties, only 20 per cent of women worked, leaving the majority of wives to spend their time cooking, cleaning and managing their households. But in later decades as women swelled the workforce, convenient pre-prepared sandwiches, microwaves and ready meals transformed Britain's kitchens - and its diet. Scroll down for video. Food in the Fifties as illustrated by this display on today's This Morning. Housewives had to feed the family with limited rations. Thanks to households being rationed to one egg per week, cakes like this one, right, had to be made with dried eggs, left, while they were topped with blancmange thanks to the lack of sugar available. The Robshaw family try making a Fifties cake with limited ingredients on BBC show 'Back in Time for Dinner', ably assisted by Mary Berry. She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'We have this idea of the Fifties being a domestic ideal - Mad Men, glamorous - \u00a0this was not the case in Britain, we were still in rationing, very austere. 'It meant there was only one fresh egg a week per household so housewives had to feed the family with these limited rations. 'It's not surprising housewives became fed-up in the Fifties - they spent 75 hours a week doing housework.' 'They had to cope with powdered eggs and a limited amount of variety to cook with.' A new BBC series called\u00a0Back In Time For Dinner challenged a modern family to try reliving what this was like. The Robshaws - father Brandon, mother Rochelle and children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15, and Fred 10 - learnt that rations certainly made birthdays less indulgent. Food historian Dr Polly Russell, pictured, took Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on a trip down memory lane for the taste buds on today's This Morning, showing what was typically eaten from the Fifties to Nineties.

Pictured, from left to right, Rosalind, 15, mum Rochelle, Fred, 10, dad Brandon and Miranda, 17, in the Fifties episode. Dr Russell invited Amanda and Phillip to try a birthday cake the family made on the show based on a Fifties recipe. She explained: 'A cake had to be made with dry eggs and icing with a blancmange topping because of the lack of sugar.\u00a0' After a taste test, Amanda admitted it was 'dry but not inedible'. Bread and dripping (often leftover fat from the Sunday roast) was a common reality at breakfast time while fresh vegetables were often taken from community allotments. In the Sixties, This Morning illustrated how a typical food spread would include cheese and pineapples on cocktails sticks and corned beef. Dr Russell revealed how this was the decade when kitchens were transformed by technology. She said: 'In the Sixties there was a real rise in disposable incomes and an increase technology in the kitchen. In the Sixties, food became more colourful and decorative, as shown by the cheese and pineapple sticks served on an orange and vibrant table cloth on today's This Morning. The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties. 'The most iconic piece is the fridge but only 50 per cent of households had one by the end of the decade, everyone else used larders. The fridge changed what you could cook.' The food historian added that food at this time became'more about display and what it looks like as well as what it tastes like.' So along with the decorative pineapple and cheese on sticks served attached to an orange, came colourful dishes like vegetable terrines. By the Seventies,\u00a040 per cent of women were working, leading to a rise in the number of convenience foods on offer. Dr Russell explained: 'Now women have less time for cooking so the food industry starts offering help in terms of processed, convenience foods so there are things like Pot Noodles available. 'There's also more branding and colourful packaging to try and persuade people to buy them.' By the Seventies, with more women going out to work, food is becoming more convenient with products like Angel Delight, back left, and ready-made cake mixtures, back right. Arctic rolls and Pot Noodles became popular in the Seventies as people spent less time cooking.

Should Charles be getting involved in politics at all when, as head of state, he'll be expected to be politically neutral? He's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the judgment was \"disappointing\" and the government would now look at how to release the letters. \"This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough,\" he said. Cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision: \"Our FOI (freedom of information) laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto, which we exercised in this case for a reason. If the legislation does not make Parliament's intentions for the veto clear enough, then we will need to make it clearer.\" The Prince's official residence, Clarence House, issued a brief statement about the decision. \"This is a matter for the government. Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.\" The anti-monarchy group Republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the Freedom of Information Act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk. \"The government must now act to end royal secrecy. Any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret,\" CEO Graham Smith said. \"We can't have a situation where we don't know what influence Charles is having on government policy.\" In a statement issued on the eve of the decision, Smith branded the monarchy one of Britain's \"most secretive institutions.\" \"Charles clearly has his own political agenda, yet his name won't be on the ballot in May. So we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy.\" Evans, the Guardian reporter, had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between Charles and various government departments under the UK's Freedom of Information Act and environmental regulations. After the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests, Evans appealed to the Information Tribunal, which referred the matter to the Upper Tribunal. The Guardian reported in 2009 that Charles had written to Treasury, Foreign Office and Education Department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials. \"The disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king,\" the paper said. The Upper Tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters, \"advocacy correspondence,\" should be disclosed, but its decision was vetoed by Britain's attorney general, who issued a certificate overriding it. Explaining his decision, the attorney general said that in that his view, the correspondence was \"undertaken as part of The Prince of Wales' preparation for becoming King\" and contained nothing that outweighed \"strong public interest against disclosure.\" The Guardian challenged the veto in court, but three high court judges dismissed it, so Evans appealed to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate."}

Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer\u2019s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost \u00a3100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth. Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie\u2019s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: \u2018Of course we wanted to win. But it\u2019s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.\u2019 Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks. ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers, the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over-raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks. Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long-term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers, who are never seen at the races. Arena Racing Company were among many companies hosting their annual drinks at Cheltenham.

Shocking pictures showed the angry mob of 2,000 people after they broke into a prison, kidnapped the man, stripped him naked and mercilessly beat him to death in front of a frenzied crowd. The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college on February 24, and he was arrested a day later. Now the alleged rape survivor has spoken out, accusing the lynched man of giving her \u00a350 to not tell anyone about the attack. Scroll down for video. Furious: Several thousand people gathered as the man (pictured, top) accused of raping a girl last month was mercilessly beaten to death. Lynched: The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death. It is unclear whether he is dead in this shocking image. Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later. Offer: The woman says that the man offered her \u00a350 to keep quiet about the alleged attack. Speaking anonymously to a local TV station, the woman said:\u00a0'The accused person was my neighbour. 'It was only after the incident...he told me,\u00a0he gave me the money to keep silent...I took the money and gave it at the police station.' The pictures showed the mob after they overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man. According to local media reports, he died while being dragged four miles through the streets as people beat and pelted him with stones. It was reported that the crowd tore down two gates before dragging him to the town's clock tower. It was said they also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Several people were injured when police used batons and opened fire, while officers were hurt when the mob pelted them with stones in Nagaland state in northeast India. A 25-year-old believed to be part of the mob was injured when police opened fire and he later died in hospital. The police later removed the man's body. Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express. Protesters: A mass rally was held in Dimapur by those who oppose the rape of a student last month. But the family of the lynched man have maintained his innocence and say the medical report of the rape complainant proves that she was not sexually assaulted. The man has been named by Indian media as Syed Sarif Uddin Khan and his brother Jamal said the killing was 'politically motivated' and accused police of 'falsely implicating his brother on behest of Naga groups, who want to root out non-tribals from the state'. Nagaland's indigenous tribal groups, especially the largest Naga tribe, have for years accused the growing population of Bengali-speaking Muslims from nearby Assam state and Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and usurping resources. Nagas have previously campaigned to evict Bengali-speaking immigrants from their territory, who they claim entice local girls into marriage for getting tribal status. Jamaluddin, an Indian army sergeant, accused Nagaland's government of 'deliberately dubbing him as a Bangladeshi... to justify the killing'. 'The girl's medical report didn't confirm rape but still my brother was jailed and then handed over to the mob who lynched him just because he was a Bengali-speaking person. 'There are multiple members of our family serving in the Army. How could they have killed him claiming he was Bangladeshi? My brother was made a scapegoat.' Police had initially claimed that the man was an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant. 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it. India is in midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student. The incident, which sparked outrage both in India and around the world, highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the country. The Indian government has also asked YouTube to block access to the documentary, claiming that its broadcast violated certain key agreements with the filmmaker. But the Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch the documentary, which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. The documentary, called 'India's Daughter', was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack.

The US is supporting the operation through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, but will not be sending any military forces.", "article": "(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,\" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said \"there will be no military intervention by the U.S.\" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, \"If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us.\" He added, \"We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner.\" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. \"This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,\" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called \"the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \"We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue (that includes) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis,\" the Iraqi ministry said. The Houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in Yemen. In addition to airstrikes, the Saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in Yemen. Just a day in, the coalition airstrikes are already costing the Houthis. Hundreds of explosions ripped through Sanaa overnight, said journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital. The Health Ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in Sanaa, the Houthi-run Saba news agency said. While Sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the Houthis' combat and control operations there, the Saudi adviser said -- it wasn't the only place struck. Compounds and military installations in Saada and Taiz also were targeted. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. The military operation, dubbed al-Hazm Storm, was launched after the Houthis rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said in a speech Thursday. It was done in accord with a joint Arab defense treaty, al-Arabi said. Specifically, the strikes aim to support Hadi, who was ousted in January after talks with the Houthis faltered, but still claims to be Yemen's rightful leader. \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, in announcing the beginning of the military campaign. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be an option for us or for our coalition partners.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen?

It was always going to be a huge ask against a French side that, for all its faults, had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this Twickenham clash. Suddenly, the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around England's throat. Lancaster had recalled experienced Leicester lock Geoff Parling in place of Dave Attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against Scotland last Saturday.

Speaking after the match, Tevez admitted he had learned how to become a dead-ball specialist from club team-mate Andrea Pirlo. 'I copied [Andrea] Pirlo,' he told the Gazetta dello Sport. 'I watch him every day in training and tried to copy him. 'But when he returns, he will take them again. He is a specialist and I have to respect that.' Tevez gave Juventus the lead with a sublime free kick after Roma were reduced to 10 men on Monday night.

It was not enough to win the match, though, as Seydou Keita headed Roma level with 12 minutes to play, earning a share of the spoils between Serie A's top two. 'We are very angry,' Tevez added. 'In the last 20 minutes we lost a game in which we had done very well. 'The team showed great character, but after the goal, when it was 11 against 10, we cannot give away such an important game.' Juve, aiming for a fourth consecutive title, are nine points clear at the summit with 13 games remaining.

Hart denied Messi from the penalty spot in the first-leg to give the Citizens a slim chance of progression in the second-leg, but it just wasn\u2019t to be as Ivan Rakitic\u2019s goal secured Barcelona\u2019s spot in the last eight.

A bookkeeper stole almost \u00a32million from his employers and used some of the money to buy a plot of land in Scotland - complete with an aristocratic title. Julian Kremer, 49, admitted fiddling the books at the estate agency he worked for in Wokingham, Berkshire, and used most of the cash to fund an internet gambling habit, a court heard. Five members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents were made redundant due to the losses while the company fell into financial ruin. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get'. Prosecutor Jane Davies told the court Kremer's crimes came to light on January 31, 2013, after the salaries of two employees had not been paid. She said: 'Steven Jones, the company director, made inquiries about the balances in five of the company accounts because it was believed the balances were not as they should have been.' The court heard he had altered the figures on at least two of the accounts to an inflated sum to make them look higher than they were. He was confronted by staff and admitted taking \u00a31.9 million over a four and a half year period, from July 2008 to January 2013, and spent more than \u00a3630,000 on gambling. Mr Recorder Martin Heslop QC said: 'One of the gambling companies described him as their best customer.' Credit card bills showed payments exceeding \u00a34,000 a month and some of the cash was spent on hotels. He also bought a small plot of land in Scotland which meant he could use the title Laird Julian Kremer and he asked for his personal details to be altered to reflect the name change. Company director, Steven Jones, who runs the company under the names Richard Worth Ltd, Richard Worth Residential Ltd and Richard Worth Holdings Ltd, told the court he had known Kremer for almost 20 years. Miss Davies said: 'Kremer stole around \u00a3250,000 a year and told Mr Jones cash flow was not improving due to debts. 'After the discovery, Mr Jones did everything he could to minimise financial ruin for the company. Kremer, who has a husband of four years, sobbed in the dock at Reading Crown Court (pictured) on Friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as 'almost as bad as it can get' 'He had to borrow \u00a3250,000 personally and made redundant five members of staff. He took on a \u00a31million debt which will take many years to repay. 'The business was the bedrock of his retirement planning and he doubts he will ever recover from the financial disaster.' Defending, Llewellyn Sellick said Mr Jones had sold the letting limb of the business and the other was still trading. He told the court: 'He is of hitherto good character, he accepts this involves a very large sum. He made an immediate confession to his employers and he repeated this when he was arrested. 'He now has nothing. He was heavily addicted to gambling and had to sell his \u00a3400,000 house. 'By the 1990s, he had lost three of his grandparents and his mother's brother. His brother Simon was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2004 aged 41.' Kremer separated from his wife in 2007 and has been in a civil marriage with his now husband since 2011. Mr Sellick said: 'He knows he has to be punished. I ask that you impose a sentence that will not crush him entirely.' The court heard Kremer, formerly from Wokingham, and now living in Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to one count of theft from an employer in January. Kremer admitted altering figures to make them look higher than they were and his crimes only came to light after there was not enough money to pay two members of staff at Richard Worth estate agents in Wokingham. Jailing him for five years, Mr Recorder Heslop said: 'This case paints a sad picture of a man of previous good character. 'There are severe financial and personal consequences for those who suffered as a result of this theft. A suspended prison sentence is, I am afraid, wholly inappropriate. 'This was a professional, sophisticated and at times extremely clever and deliberate theft involving fraud, forgery and misrepresentation to those for whom you worked and it is a theft on a very significant scale carried out over a substantial period of time. 'The total sum is \u00a31,981,936 and this is as bad a case as one could imagine. It is quite clear the money went on gambling. 'There is also evidence of high living. You were using this money to enjoy a significantly high level of living.' Kremer, carrying a large holdall and wearing a black suit and yellow tie, wiped his eyes as he"}

Their lawyer Daryl Zaslow will take a $3million cut, according to court papers. Scroll down for video. The family of comedian James McNair, (left and right) who was the mentor to 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan received a reported $10million payout from Wal-Mart. Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the accident on June 7. Zaslow wrote that he was 'able to convince Wal-Mart' that the hefty settlement would outweigh any potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicized lawsuit, according to a filing obtained by\u00a0DNAinfo. He said the $10million settlement was a 'truly outstanding result,' especially because McNair's past income was not large enough  for his children to 'project a significant lost-wage claim'. According to DNAinfo, McNair, who was 62 at the time of his death, worked part-time at the Salvation Army when he wasn't doing stand-up gigs. The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. But the amount was revealed in legal documents filed last month in Westchester Surrogate's Court. Denita, 19, wrote in an affidavit included in the filing that 'no amount of money could replace' her father, but that the settlement 'greatly exceeds anything I imagined and I could not be more grateful.' When the settlement was first announced in January, Zaslow said Walmart had 'accepted their responsibility' in the crash. 'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' he said. 'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.' He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.' James McNair was killed when the limo van he was traveling in was struck by an 18-wheeler on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7.

The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the superstore to admit no liability for the crash. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident. 'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.' Kevin Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey. The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash. In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash. Morgan, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash, has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart. Morgan, a former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star, suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, according to his lawyer, and his lawsuit against Wal-Mart is proceeding in federal court."}

Jason Taylor, 21, shared an eight-month relationship with Jodie Emery, 26, but after the pair broke up he became jealous, often going to her house in\u00a0Preston, Lancashire, to spy on her. Convinced she was seeing another man he sent the mother-of-two a text on September 22 last year which said: 'Last chance, otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there'. He then went to Miss Emery's home and kicked in the front door.

During his trial at Preston Crown Court, Taylor tried to claim that that there was no innocent reason for Mr Wilson being in the house, and denied intending to kill him, but a jury took just an hour and a half to decide he was lying. Today he was handed down a life sentence and told he cannot apply for parole until at least 2040. Judge Anthony Russell QC told Taylor: 'The victim was someone completely unknown to you and had done you absolutely no harm at all and yet was murdered by you for no other reason other than he happened to be the person at the home of Jody Emery. 'This was a particularly shocking murder because it was pure chance Adam Wilson was the person who you vented your rage on because you were unable to accept your relationship with Jody Emery was finished. 'People have to accept that sometimes things go wrong in their lives and relationship do sometimes end. You were not prepared to accept that. Taylor kicked down Miss Emery's front door on September 22 last year, and began fighting with Mr WIlson (pictured), fatally stabbing him in the thigh. 'You persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance. 'You were not prepared to let her move along with her life or yours because of your obsessive jealousy. She was perfectly entitled to see other people, it was none of your business if she did so. 'You murdered this man for no other reason other than he was in a place he was perfectly entitled to be. He had done no wrong.' The court earlier heard that Taylor, a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses, had been in an eight-month relationship with Miss Emery. The pair had shared a caravan holiday together in Scarborough, but after they returned home Miss Emery secretly terminated a pregnancy. When Taylor found out he flew into a rage and the pair split. Unable to accept the break-up Taylor began texting and calling Miss Emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together, and often went to her house to watch her, often coming up to look through the windows. Two days before the murder took place Taylor was at pub\u00a0the Tardy Gate. When he spotted one of Miss Emery's former boyfriends he became angry, smashed a window and tried to punch the man. Louise Blackwell QC said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery saying: 'I miss you. Maybe in time you'll want to try again'. She asked him not to contact her but later that evening he sent her another text saying: 'Can I come for cuddles?' Miss Emery responded, 'you being weird then', to which he said: 'I'm not my head is just f..ked' and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during his holiday with Miss Emery.

Doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims, drug addicts, and those with infections under new plans (file picture) And one of the plans reportedly been considered is offering patients transplants using organs from people who would have usually had them rejected after being deemed to 'high-risk'. According to the Sunday Times, the proposals would create a special 'fast track' waiting list for the high risk organs. Dr Titus Augustine, director of transplantation at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told the newspaper: 'One of the things that we have been looking at is trying to match risk with risk. 'There are people on the lost who are willing to take that risk, accept kidneys from people with known infection risk or cancer risk.' Organs are deemed high risk if they come from cancer patients, intravenous drug users and those with a history of having high-risk sex lives. However, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust have said they rejected a research proposal looking into high-risk organ donation. A spokesperson said: 'The Trust submits hundreds of research proposals and applications for funding every year. 'This was an application for funding for a research project looking in to offering patients at risk of dying without transplantation organs considered high risk. 'This proposal was rejected by the funding body and therefore will not be progressing any further.'

Figures obtained from NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority which oversees donations, show that last year, 333 patients were given high-risk organs. This represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts, cancer sufferers or those aged over 71. The 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers, the obese or the very sexually active who may have HIV or other infections. But Bryon Jaques, who worked for Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals before emigrating to Australia, warned the NHS drive to increase donations was flawed. It comes after it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm. The relatives of Darren Hughes, 42, and grandfather Robert Stuart, 67, say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) in 2013 and died within three weeks. The organs belonged to a 39-year-old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in England and Scotland before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Birmingham and Edinburgh from accepting his kidneys. Mr Jaques, who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist, said: \u2018We were regularly offered donors that I considered to be very high risk. We were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis (blood infection). \u2018I was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer, which has a high risk of transmission. \u2018We were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure. The vast majority of transplants that do take place in the UK are successful and that\u2019s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community. Last year \u2013 2013/2014 \u2013 there were 4,655 transplants, an increase of 10 per cent on the year before."}

Casciaro's brothers Kyle and Ryan also play for the national team, and the family have been supported by their parents throughout their footballing journey. Casciaro believes that Scotland and Ireland will be in a battle for third place in their group behind Poland and Germany.", "article": "As the scorer of Gibraltar\u2019s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night. However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium. If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane\u2019s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip. Gibraltar's players celebrate after Lee Casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on Sunday. Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar\u2019s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye. His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden. For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida. Casciaro (centre) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in Gibraltar. \u2018It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,\u2019 he beamed. \u2018It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It\u2019s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar. \u2018I don\u2019t think I will get a hero\u2019s reception when I get home. We still lost the game \u2013 but it is still an achievement to get the goal. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba celebrates the goal at Hampden Park, which levelled the score at 1-1. \u2018We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we\u2019ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch. \u2018Even two or three years ago I didn\u2019t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn\u2019t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day. \u2018This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling. \u2018I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I\u2019m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.\u2019 Casciaro (right) vies for the ball with Scotland's Ikechi Anya, who he later swapped shirts with. Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan\u2019s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team. \u2018I would think we have shown that we are not,\u2019 he said. \u2018We are improving and we do try to play football, which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group. We try to create a good game for the spectators to watch.\u2019 Last June, the first-ever winning goal scored by the British overseas territory - with a 30,000-population comparable with Wishaw - was slotted home in a 1-0 friendly win over Malta in Portugal. That night the history-maker was Kyle Casciaro, Lee\u2019s brother, who was an unused substitute on Sunday. A third brother, Ryan, played in defence for Gibraltar at Hampden in front of proud parents Henry and Helen. Lee Casciaro's brother Ryan, who also plays for the national team, shares a joke with Steven Fletcher. \u2018I\u2019m keeping it in the family,\u2019 smiled Lee. \u2018My mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today. We have to go to Faro in Portugal to play our home games, but they have always been there for us. It is thanks to them that we are here. It is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level. I don\u2019t think that happens very often in the world of football to have three brothers in an international squad.\u2019 With the benefit of having played all the Group D teams now, Casciaro feels that Scotland and Ireland \u2013 who meet in Dublin in June - will be in a battle for third place behind Poland and Germany. \u2018Germany are the world champions and Poland are"}

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi urged soldiers and government-backed Shiite militias to spare civilians, and called on those misled by the Islamic State to lay down their arms. The operation is an important step on the road to the IS-held city of Mosul, and could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions.", "article": "Iraqi warplanes and artillery began pounding Tikrit this morning as 30,000 troops and irregulars prepared to attack the city, a stronghold of the Islamic State insurgency. The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced last night by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shiite militias to spare civilians. Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against the Tikrit area's mainly Sunni population. Scroll down for video. Attack: Volunteer Shiite fighters, who are supporting the Iraqi government forces in the fight against the Islamic State group fire a howitzer artillery canon in the village of Awaynat near the city of Tikrit. Irregulars: Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite fighters chant slogans as they gather at Udhaim dam, north of Baghdad, ahead of an advance on Islamic State positions Tikrit that is expected to begin today. Feeding the soul: Soldiers and irregulars take a moment to pray as Iraq masses its forces outside the city, which was the birthplace of Saddam Hussein and an important step on the road to the IS-held city of Mosul. Feeding the body: Fighters scoff their rations ahead of the attack. It is feared the mainly Shiite forces of the Iraqi government could attack the area's mainly Sunni population, worsening sectarian divisions. On social media, Mr Abadi called 'for utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property' in the city, which was last year the scene of a brutal massacre of hundreds of mainly Shiite Iraqi army recruits. Government forces have been working their way north in recent months, notching up key victories against IS. But Tikrit, which has resisted them several times, is their toughest target yet. 'Security forces are advancing on three main fronts towards Tikrit, Ad-Dawr (to the south) and Al-Alam (to the north),' a senior army officer on the ground told AFP by telephone. The army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army, police, counter-terrorism units, a government-controlled volunteer group known as the Popular Mobilisation units and local Sunni tribes opposed to IS. 'The attack is being carried out using fighter jets, helicopters and artillery targeting Tikrit to secure the advance and cut supply routes,' he said. Military sources said Iraqi warplanes were involved but it was not immediately clear whether foreign air support - Iranian or from the US-led coalition fighting IS - was also called in. According to both Iraqi and Iranian media, Qassem Suleimani - supremo of the elite Iranian Quds force, specialising in'subversive warfare' - was in Salaheddin province to help coordinate operations. Massing: Iraqi Army and volunteer fighters prepare at Sedull Udeyim region before moving into Tikrit. Good morale: Iraqi forces have notched up key victories against IS as they've inched north in recent weeks. Religion: A soldier walks past a line of armoured cars, one of which has a photo of a cleric in the window. Cavalry: Iraqi armoured personnel carriers are lined up ahead of the attack on Tikrit today. Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shiite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions. Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shiite majority. Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shiite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq. 'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night. Hadi al-Ameri, the Popular Mobilisation commander, appealed to Tikrit residents on Saturday to leave their homes within 48 hours so government forces could 'wrap up the battle of the revenge for Speicher.' Speicher is a military base near Tikrit from which hundreds of new, mostly Shiite, recruits were kidnapped before being executed last summer, as the Islamic State insurgency took control of much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland. Shiite militias in particular have vowed to avenge the Speicher executions, sparking fears of mass killings against Sunnis if Tikrit were to be recaptured. Mr Abadi appealed to residents to turn against the jihadists, who have suffered a string of military losses since a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations stepped up their support for Iraq's embattled government. 'I call on all those who were misled and made mistakes in the past to lay down their arms today. This may be the last chance,' Mr Abadi said, suggesting some could be granted amnesty. Iraqi forces tried and failed several times to wrest back Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city on the Tigris river around 100 miles north of Baghdad. Ready: A wide view shows Iraqi soldiers and"}

Joe Alridge, 36, is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, as well as the Shrivers. Aldridge, who took his own life in his pickup truck on Friday morning, was described as a recluse by those in the town. It was known in the town that Aldridge's family and the Shrivers had been feuding for years, a resident of nearby Summersville told Daily Mail Online. The Shrivers were described as a hard-working clan that owned businesses including construction, cabinet making and cattle farming projects since 1969. Darrell Shriver's wife Martha, 67, was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. She is expected to survive. 'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' John Shriver said. The elder Shriver discovered the bodies of Carey and Valirea after getting a call to check on them from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star. The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his older, college-aged sister. He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'.

The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold. John Shriver was unsure about why the killer would target his own family members, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between the shooter and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to\u00a0Arkansas Online. The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot.

They drove around the country in a green 1999 Dodge Intrepid, accumulating almost 540,000 miles. They are likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car, and have also visited motels in each of the 48 states and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels.", "article": "A Michigan couple has completed a quest to visit all 3,108 counties in the lower 48 states after driving around the country in a green 1999 Dodge Intrepid for almost nine years. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to Nantucket in their car, which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles. They can now navigate small towns and state highway systems without any help after they accumulated knowledge about how the country is set up, the couple told Daily Mail Online. Jennifer and Jonathan Riehl, 32 and 31, completed their journey to the lower 48 states' 3,108 counties when they arrived in Nantucket, their last county, with their green 1999 Dodge Intrepid. They have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006, though the Riehls bought a GPS device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the US where the streets aren't labelled. Jennifer Riehl, 32, a research scientist at Michigan Technological University, and her husband, 31, an engineering instructor at the institution, typically drove about 50,000 miles a year. Jonathan, who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates, hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are 'genuinely baffled' by the accomplishment. Mr Riehl bought the car as a high school senior living in New Jersey for $9,000. At the time, 2002, it had 70,000 miles. The couple met in 2005 and have had their share of adventures since, including meeting a bear and running into nasty weather, according to\u00a0The Cape Cod Times. The car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties, and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16-hour days on the road. They think a 15,000-mile trip from New Jersey to Alaska to their home on Michigan's Upper Peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car. First counties visited by the couple, which met in upstate New York, include many Northeastern destinations where they visited friends. Jonathan, who works with geographical information science computer programs, saw that they had visited a fair number of counties together and during childhood road trips. A move to Nashville, Tennessee, for two years, sparked the idea that they could actually hit all the counties. The contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties, and the addition of Alaska and Hawaii brings the total to 3,143. The couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on Tuesday during their spring break trip. Above, pictured in Plymouth, Mass on Wednesday. The couple has already visited some boroughs of Alaska, but plans on finishing the state and starting on Hawaii. Jennifer's mother lives in Texas, but the travelers don't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit. They have spent days going to the southern state by route of California or Idaho, most recently picking up five counties they had missed in the Gem State during previous journeys. Their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. With academic schedules, the pair has gone to most of the thousands of counties during breaks from school, including winter holidays where they truck through snow. Jonathan proposed to Jennifer on a 2011 trip to Manitoba, Canada, where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three Mexican states. However, their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to Winnepeg in blinding snow with Jennifer keeping track of the road's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove. The couple often taken the long route to friends' and relatives' houses, going from Michigan to Texas via California or Idaho. The car, which Jonathan bought in 2002, still has the same engine. The couple avoids the interstate and uses small and dirt roads when possible. Above, Jennifer stands in Golden Valley County, Montana, in 2012. Oscar Voss of the nonprofit national Extra Miler Club, a travel group where the Riehls are members, says that the couple is likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car. The club lists 38 people who have 'bagged' all 3,143 counties in the entire US, the first being Ed Dietz and Arthur Palmer in 1976. Most of the people who have been to all the counties are over 60, according to the club's Valerie Naylor. The Riehls said that all members of the club go around the country with different goals, such as visiting national parks or climbing to the highest points. Jonathan and Jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can. Jonathan is particularly interested in architecture and Jennifer likes to hike all over the country. As a pair they have also visited motels in each of the 48 states but Delaware and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels, hearing stories from a variety of locals. Jonathan, who is doing"}

Peppy look: This model was snapped running in a sweatsuit from the collection, which features a peplum back. She later added: 'The Sacai collection is undoubtedly a vanity project for Nike, but its premise - that female athletes prize style and appearance over functionality and performance - is completely tone-deaf.' Others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated, billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity. 'Seriously, that Nike women's line is HIDEOUS. Women's athletic wear needs improving, but this is NOT an improvement. Capes? Dresses? WTF! (sic)' one commenter wrote on Twitter. New wings: The billowy fabric on these pieces from the line can be seen flowing in the as the model runs forward. Not a fan: This commenter tweeted that the entire collection was 'horrifying' Party out back: This jacket looks normal in the front but features plenty of pleated fabric from behind. Bizarre pairing: This royal blue sweatshirt and skirt combination features matching transparent pleats and a hint of hunter green. Another woman tweeted: 'Ew. Yeah, that new Nike women's fashion line is a miss.' Someone else joked that the skirt-filled collection: 'Looks very practical.' However, Sacai\u2019s founder Chitose Abe explained on Nike's website that wearability was a significant consideration in her designs.

High-tech: The back of this sweatshirt is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed. Not a fan: This commenter simply said 'ew' after seeing the brand's latest designs. Proud artist: Sacai\u2019s founder Chitose Abe posed next a model who was wearing her designs for Nike. 'The idea of functionality is important to me, as is fabric innovation, which has always been at the heart of Sacai,' Ms Abe said. 'For me, Nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core. It has been inspiring to work together.' Indeed, Ms Abe claims that the flamboyant-looking fabrics and over-the-top embellishments on each of the designs has been added in order to enhance the performance of the athlete. The back of one sweatshirt, for example, is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed by Abe and the brand. 'The garments come to life as the wearer walks and moves, expressing both beauty and strength. We feel it\u2019s a perfect marriage between sport and style,' Kurt Parker, VP/Creative Director, Nike Sportswear, said on the site. Pricey sweats: Many of the pieces in the collection, including this sweatshirt and skirt, retail for $200 or more.

Marsh justified his belief by comparing Kane to other players who have joined the Premier League for big fees and are yet to match his form. 'Manchester City\u00a0paid \u00a332million for a relatively untried young player called Eliaquim Mangala. If Mangala is worth \u00a332million, Harry Kane is worth \u00a3100million all day long,' Marsh explained. 'Angel di Maria cost Manchester United \u00a360million. I think Harry Kane is a much better player than Di Maria in the Premier League,' Marsh added. Marsh backed Kane to become a 'bigger and better' player than England and Newcastle legend Alan Shearer. Marsh said the form and fees of Angel di Maria (left) and Eliaquim Mangala make Kane worth \u00a3100million. Kane marked his England debut with a goal 79 seconds after replacing Wayne Rooney against Lithuania on Friday.

This is nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in 1985.

Colleen Ann Harris, whose case is expected to open on Wednesday, is accused of shooting dead her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013. Decades before, in 1985, she shot dead her first husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her. Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it. Accused: Colleen Ann Harris, left, is about to go on trial for the 2013 death of her husband, Bob Harris, right, whom she shot dead nearly 30 years after she shot dead her first husband. 'In each case, she kills her husband in the bedroom. In each case, she uses a shotgun,' said El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander, wrote in court papers, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'In each case, she is going through marital difficulties. In each case, she delays reporting the crime... In each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense.' She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her. She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia. The prosecution told a very different tale. They claimed she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense. She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office. Scene: She allegedly shot him dead in the couple's Placerville, California home (pictured) as they were going through marital problems. They had separated but he had returned to care for her after surgery. The jury ultimately said there was insufficient evidence that she intended to murder her husband and she was acquitted of murder. Then in 1990, she married Bob Harris, who had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later. Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported. When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out. But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her. 'My dad, bless his heart, was there taking care of Colleen despite whatever circumstances were going on between them,' his son Andy Harris told the Sacramento Bee. Then on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors claim. She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage. After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office. Harris, who married Colleen in 1990 despite her previous case, left behind two sons and a daughter, right. Beloved: He worked in the Forest Service\u00a0and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband. Mr Harris' family said they remain devastated by the loss. 'The death of your father is devastating enough,' Andy Harris said. 'And then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member. 'There is a real sense of betrayal and wondering if this person had the capacity to love.' His father had worked with the Forest Service for 30 years before retiring in 1997, according to his obituary. He umpired baseball, from Little League to semi-professional teams, and worked as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. A judge has ruled that prosecutors may talk about the first case in the upcoming trial. Attorney Eric Schlueter had fought the decision, saying in court papers: 'The prior incident has ZERO relevance to the current action especially in light of the fact that Mrs. Harris was ACQUITTED of the charge.'"}

It is set to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month and may be listed in supermarkets and food and drink outlets in May.", "article": "For many disastrous cooks, boiling an egg is the one task in the kitchen that they can actually master. However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At \u00a31.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon. Marketed as the Yowk -'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven. Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk. Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.' The product is to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in May. A coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it, along with some retailers, Hetherington told The Grocer."}
{"abstract": "Experts have warned that two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs, nicknamed the cannibal slug, to expand their territory in Britain. These slugs, which grow up to six inches long, are more aggressive than native slugs and can devour garden plants. It is too early to tell how much of a problem native slugs will be this year, but gardeners should be prepared to fight larger numbers of slugs.", "article": "Giant \u2018cannibal\u2019 slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across Britain, experts have warned. Two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs - an horrific, aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory. The species, nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives, was first spotted in this country in 2012. The giant Spanish slug, pictured, was first spotted in the UK in 2012 and is now starting to take hold. Sightings have since been reported in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, London and Hampshire. But this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further. Dr Ian Bedford, the expert who first identified the species three years ago, warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters. \u2018If this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before May we could see very high numbers of the Spanish slug this year,\u2019 he said. Dr Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said the slug - which officially is called Arion vulgaris and originates in southern Europe - cannot survive extreme cold temperatures. Common native slugs, although less aggressive, are much better at surviving cold conditions. Experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year, because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes. The winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps, blizzards and frosts, which hit the new population of Spanish slugs hard. But the intervening two winters have been much warmer, particularly in southern England which has barely seen any snow in 24 months. The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C (39.9F), and the year before was even warmer at 5.8C (42.4F). The average English winter temperature is 4.2C (39.6F). Slug expert Dr Ian Bedford, pictured, said Britain was on course for record numbers of Spanish slugs. The slug, pictured, is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions. The Spanish slugs, which are thought to have made it to the British mainland on imported vegetables, have been recorded feeding on dead mice, meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets. They also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners. Unlike native species, they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them. They also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs, so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly. Dr Bedford said: \u2018If you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water, add a bit of household bleach, and then bury the remains 18 inches deep. \u2018If they spread it could really affect British farmers. We found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs. \u2018If we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year.\u2019 Anna Platoni, entomologist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year. \u2018Although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity, it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important, rather than over the winter,\u2019 she said. \u2018They tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather.\u2019 Sarah Fuller, marketing director at Wyevale Garden Centres added: \u2018Slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners, making this hobby and pastime a true 24-hour activity. \u2018Last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month. \u2018It\u2019s likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods.\u2019"}

This means that an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a mountain, water, or an obstacle, with the pilots generally unaware of the danger until it is too late. Yesterday's crash in almost the exact same spot, all 144 passengers, including six crew members were killed on the flight en route from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.

Reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the Airbus A320 had been analysed and revealed that a'structural failure' was responsible for the disaster. It is thought the windscreen gave way, incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call. Rescue helicopters have today resumed the search for debris and bodies at the crash site. As with the crash 60 years ago, there are no survivors. Today, search operations resumed at first light this morning in near-freezing conditions for debris and bodies at the crash site. Reports revealed the aircraft had suffered technical issues, including a landing gear problem, a day before it was due to fly from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.

'You used to have a wire that you slid down the window, when it was mechanical. But now it's electronic,' said Mr Dahl. The man approaches Mr Dahl's car and pulls the handles realizing the door is locked. He then removes his backpack and flashes a light into the car. The man holds the backpack up the door and within seconds it is unlocked. He gets into the vehicle and searches through the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment taking a club on the steering wheel as well as store rewards cards. Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson, said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car, according to an earlier report. Mr Carlson had his car broken into two times before he installed a surveillance camera at his home. 'It's running through codes automatically or it's a button they're pushing or something is happening, but whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys,' Mr Carlson said at the time of the incident. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car (above Mr Dahl's Honda Ridgeline pictured in his driveway) Captain Eric Sano from the police department said that it is apparent as technology adapts, criminals are adapting, so it is important for authorities to be ahead of criminals. Scott Wagner, a special agent from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, said in January that he had knowledge of a special system being used. He said: 'It\u2019s a little black box. They can carry it in a backpack, when you hit your fob to unlock your car they can actually steal the codes to your keypad and then unlock your car later.' Detective Michaud said there has not been a lot of similarly reported cases in the area over the years and that he is unsure of what kind of device is being used in the break ins. Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson (above), said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car. Mr Carlson said: 'Whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys' (above a thief breaking into his car earlier this year) 'I've seen it both ways - a device in their hand as well as a device as big as an iron carried in a backpack,' he said. 'As technology moves on, the device gets smaller.' As for how to stay protected as a driver as this mystery device looms, Detective Michaud warns drivers to keep valuables out of the car. He said: 'We ask that people to not keep anything of value in the car. If you are going to leave your registration in the vehicle cross off identifying information, and let the officer know you crossed it off for security concerns.' The investigation into the incident is ongoing."}

But the first arrivals were not the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the Lindo Wing were Michael and Carole Middleton - better known to George as 'Grandpa Michael' and 'Granny Carole'. Almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away, the Middletons have become a fixture in little George's life - with Prince Charles left to complain that they 'never let me see my grandson'. Scroll down for video. March of the Middletons: Prince Charles is reportedly upset by what he calls 'the March of the Middletons' In this case, the heir to the throne may well have a point. Visits to Highgrove, Charles' Gloucestershire home, have been few and far between. By contrast, William and Kate regularly take their son to the Berkshire village of Bucklebury where the Middletons live in a \u00a34.5m Georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside. Indeed, it was to Bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the Lindo Wing, with Prince George's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather Michael. The intimate photos, which show George cradled in the arms of his smiling mother, were, with hindsight, a sign of things to come. Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, was always determined to be a hands-on grandmother - and so it has proved. First visitors: Carole and Michael Middleton were the first people to meet the newborn Prince George. Sign of things to come: His first official photo was taken on the lawn of the Middletons' Bucklebury home. But the Middleton matriarch's determination to be involved in her grandson's life hasn't always gone down well with the rest of the family. 'Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats,' confided a source to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare. 'All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.' So how much involvement does Carole have in George's life? The answer is plenty. From cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child, there are few areas of George's life in which the Middletons aren't involved. Just a few weeks ago, Carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in Mustique, where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday. Although nanny Maria Theresa Borallo was there to deal with most of the childcare, Carole, who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson, was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand-in-hand with a toddling George. Holiday: George and his parents often holiday with the Middletons, seen here en route to Mustique. 'Queen Carole': Sources say Carole is taking an increasing amount of control over Prince George's life. Involved: Carole, seen here with the Duchess of Cornwall, is said to be a hands-on grandmother to George. And that is far from the only occasion that Carole has enjoyed one-on-one time with George. Just before the trip to Mustique, the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer's market with the third-in-line, who was, say witnesses, 'trying all the food'. Speaking to People Magazine, another onlooker told of Carole's obvious pride in her grandson's progress. 'It was just really, really sweet. He was just being like a normal toddler is, running around and exploring \u2013 he is such a sweetie. He's lovely. A real bundle of fun. 'She [Carole] just keeps telling people \"He's gorgeous, isn't he?\" like any other grandmother would say about their little one.' The Middletons also joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their infant son at Anmer Hall on Christmas Day where, according to sources, Kate made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get-togethers. Carole's influence could also be seen in the plans for George's first birthday celebrations which, in a break with royal tradition, included a Peter Rabbit themed party. Not amused: Charles is said to dislike what he sees as his 'peripheral' role in Prince George's life. Loving: This framed photograph of Charles and George has pride of place at Clarence House. Contrast that with Prince William's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny Barbara Barnes because his parents were on tour in Canada. Charles' first year was marked in a similar way, with the Prince of Wales spending the day"}

His team is using the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to simulate the waves and compare them to real seismograms. The resulting map could reveal the locations of tectonic plates and magma, which can cause earthquakes and volcanic activity.", "article": "Scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble-like simulations of Earth's interior. By recording seismic tremors, researchers are able to build a 3D picture of Earth's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core. They do this by analysing the speed of the tremors, which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma. Computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures. In this view of the mantle below the Pacific Ocean, slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue. The Princeton team fed data from seismograms into a computer model, which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter. The resulting \"synthetic seismograms\" were compared to real seismograms, and the differences fed back into the model to improve it. The researchers do this repeatedly, comparing data with simulations and extracting differences. With each pass, they improve their model. In these images, slower waves are in red and orange, while faster vibrations are in green and blue. The 3D models were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km) - by the end of the year. His team have been using the number-crunching capabilities of the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second. Professor Tromp has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater, which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide. These stations make recordings, or seismograms, that detail the movement produced by seismic waves, which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes. 'We are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes,' said Professor Tromp, 'but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features.' The resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates, which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other. The images were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a 3D map of the entire mantle, down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km), by the end of the year. A three-dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average. The maps could also reveal the locations of magma that, if it comes to the surface, causes volcanic activity, the researchers said. Previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves: primary or compressional waves, secondary or shear waves, and surface waves. Professor Tromp technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake \u2013 described as adjoint waves. The Titan computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter, and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms. The differences are then used by Titan to improve its model. Professor Tromp said: 'You don't know what it is you are looking for\u2026that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover.' This map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles (389 km). Blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds, and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds. The two panels on the right show a 746 miles (1,200 km) deep slice of the Earth taken from points B to b in Europe as shown in the left panel. A computer program designed by Tromp and his team compares real earthquake data to a computer-generated model, then uses any discrepancies to improve the model."}

As England walked out to play Scotland yesterday evening, it said there were 180 days to go. Everything England do in this Six Nations is being seen through the prism of their prospects in the tournament which will start here at Twickenham on September 18 with their opener against Fiji. When Stuart Lancaster\u2019s side failed their biggest test of this competition, slumping to a shattering 19-9 loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium a fortnight ago, many observers said the rest of the Six Nations was redundant for them. Exeter wing Jack Nowell crosses over to score England's third try and send them top of the Six Nations table. Ben Youngs hands off a tackle as England recovered from a half-time deficit to win at Twickenham. VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review. They said that the match against Ireland was the only game that could tell us whether England were making significant progress in the build-up to the World Cup and nothing that happened in their last two games against France or Scotland mattered. They were damned for the manner of their defeat, of course. Unflattering comparisons were drawn with where this side stands six months before the World Cup to the level Clive Woodward\u2019s side had reached at the same stage prior to the 2003 tournament. \u2018Based on their performances in the Six Nations, England are running the risk of being labelled the most foolish team in the competition,\u2019 England World Cup winner Will Greenwood wrote. \u2018England need to play with tempo, yes, but they need to do it with their rugby brains fully engaged and that is not what they have been doing at key moments.\u2019 England won the game but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations. Mike Brown was one of the better performers but England spurned too many opportunities at Twickenham. Despite the predictions, though, Saturday's battle for the Calcutta Cup told us plenty about England\u2019s prospects in the autumn. It wasn\u2019t all good by any means. In fact, the evidence of an exhilarating first half suggested again that England are still short of the standard they have to achieve to be realistic contenders for the World Cup. It felt like a wasted opportunity. Despite concerns that the match had not sold out, the atmosphere at Twickenham had been bolstered by the scenes playing on the screens inside and outside the stadium from Cardiff where Wales\u2019 victory over Ireland put England back in with a chance of winning the Six Nations. When England tore Scotland apart in the opening minutes, it felt as if this could yet be the game that ignited their confidence and laid the foundation for future success. That feeling did not last for long. George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half but the first half will have worried them. The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup. Defeating Scotland however will not lead the top nations to fear England, and time is running out. England were not ruthless enough in attack. They squandered chance after chance to convert breakaways, eschewing easy passes, making the wrong decisions. They should have scored four tries before half-time but they were limited to Jonathan Joseph\u2019s score after a neat sidestep five minutes into the game. It seemed then as if England were about to embark on the points rampage that would put them in prime position ahead of the final fixtures of the competition next weekend. That rampage did not materialise. Instead, Scotland came back into the game and more doubts began to surface about England. This time, it was their defence which suffered in comparison to the heroic efforts of the Welsh earlier in the day. Mark Bennett bulldozed his way over for a score with Scotland\u2019s first chance of the game midway through the half. Twickenham may still be a formidable place to get a result, but England are not unbeatable there. Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway as Lancaster's side returned to the Six Nations summit. England allowed Scotland back into the game too easily, and they lack momentum heading to the World Cup. Scotland actually led 13-10 at the interval. Their supporters began to dream of a first victory at Twickenham for 32 years. It was hardly the response to the defeat in Dublin that Lancaster was looking for. \u2018England need to be careful out there or they could end up with real egg on their face,\u2019 Woodward said at half-time. England banished that idea when George Ford burst over for a try three minutes into the second half but, even though Scotland never threatened again, England remained unconvincing. There were times when they seemed to be trying to set a new record for ways in which they could ruin their good work. Anthony Watson runs clear but England repeatedly failed to take their chances at Twickenham on Saturday. Twice they"}

Ed Miliband today sought to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras. The Labour leader, who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities,was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife Justine in a modest kitchen at his \u00a32million North London home. Now it has emerged that the image of the Labour leader as a man of the people with a run-of-the-mill home was not all it appeared. For Mr Miliband actually lives in a house with two kitchens. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children tonight revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' The poky room the couple were pictured in, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed last night by a family friend to be a 'functional kitchenette' for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Today Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail. 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in yesterday's paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen. Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day. Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.' Last night a Labour Party spokesman declined to comment."}

The FBI said Friday it believes AWOL policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from Southern California to El Paso with his father in a pickup a week ago. The FBI is offering $25,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of Solis in connection with the death of Salome Rodriguez, 23, who died after a fight between the men in a downtown Pomona, California, bar. \"The pattern suggests he crossed into Mexico, but he has family and friends living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez,\" said Scott Garriola, special FBI agent who runs the fugitive task force from the Los Angeles Bureau. \"So he could be on either side of the border.\" \"It's a quick bus ride from the interior of Mexico to other parts of the country and Central America.\" The FBI, Pomona Police and Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to comment on whether Victor Solis might face charges for allegedly helping his son flee to El Paso. Garriola said Solis is a veteran of the Marines and \"he has extensive training and weapons\" understanding. Authorities posted three photos of Solis, with and without facial hair, and said he may now have a full beard. Police said after the early morning bar fight Solis pursued his victim on foot in the nightclub district and shot him multiple times. Garriola said Solis then reportedly called his father in Lancaster, California, and later that morning they began the trek to El Paso. Victor Solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in El Paso and his son made some incriminating statements \"not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again,\" Garriola said. Henry Solis worked in the Devonshire Division of the San Fernando Valley, where he rode with a training officer. Earlier this week, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck fired Solis and appealed for him to give up. \"You have dishonored this police department, your country and your service to your country,\" Beck said. Marine Corps records say Solis served in Iraq from April to November 2007, earning several medals, including for the Iraq campaign, global war on terrorism service and Marine Corps good conduct. The personnel file also shows Solis was an aircraft maintenance technician and a security guard. Garriola said he was confident Solis will be caught, and said he shared Beck's opinion of Solis. \"It's a brother law enforcement officer, he served our country, we echo that same indignation.\""}

In April last year, police in the eastern city of Lahore booked a nine-month-old boy on an attempted murder charge.", "article": "Two newly-wed brothers in Pakistan are spending their first weeks of married life behind bars after police arrested them on terrorism charges for letting off firecrackers during their joint wedding ceremony. Officers in Karachi said the grooms went 'too far' during the celebrations, and have charged the brothers and three other people under the explosive provisions of anti-terrorism legislation. If found guilty they could face long prison sentences, or even the death penalty. The brothers set off firecrackers, like the ones pictured, during their wedding ceremony in Karachi, Pakistan, but now face spending their married life behind bars after being charged with terrorism offences. Setting off fireworks and firing weapons into the air is a longstanding custom at Pakistani weddings, but police officer Abbas Golarchi said the wedding party's celebrations scared the community living nearby. He told agency AFP: 'Very powerful crackers were being used during the marriage ceremony creating fear among the neighbourhood, a densely populated area of the city.' The five arrested are in police custody awaiting a remand hearing which is due to take place on Wednesday. A sentence of the death penalty is unlikely, it is thought, before no-one was harmed during the joint wedding celebration. It is customary at Pakistani weddings to set off firecrackers and fireworks, and human rights campaigners have accused the police and judiciary of using anti-terrorism legislation in cases not related to militancy. Human rights campaigners say Pakistan's anti-terrorism legislation and anti-terrorism courts are frequently misused to prosecute cases that have nothing to do with militancy. In their World Report 2015, Human Rights Watch criticised the passing of the Protection of Pakistan Act by the country's government, denouncing it as 'overly broad' counter-terrorism legislation that violates international human rights standards and allows security forces to act without accountability. More generally, Pakistani police are often criticised for their heavy-handed approach. In April last year, police in the eastern city of Lahore booked a nine-month-old boy on an attempted murder charge after his family members allegedly threw bricks at officers trying to collect an unpaid bill. At least 40 people were killed in 2005 after firecrackers exploded on a bus carrying wedding guests back from a ceremony in Lahore, eastern Pakistan, according to a BBC report."}

'People say getting to Wembley for the semi-final is a big thing but not really. Winning and getting to the final is the big priority,' he said. 'In many ways I wish the semi-final wasn't at Wembley because I think it takes a little bit away from it. For me Wembley should be the ultimate game. 'But of course it is a great opportunity if we do go through to play a game at Wembley, which we certainly wouldn't turn down.

They have conceded just six goals in nine league matches since the turn of the year, during which time they are unbeaten. Despite enforced changes to his backline everyone now appears to know what job they are supposed to be doing - unlike earlier in the campaign when no matter who he brought in there was always an air of vulnerability. 'What is pleasing are the poor goals we have stopped conceding,' he said. 'Our method of play is based on aggressive pressure and with that you limit teams to not many opportunities. 'When that doesn't function well you concede poor goals. That was the key, we made too many mistakes.

He was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis at age 14, which left him paralyzed from the waist down, but he was inspired by a visit from Reggie Miller to never give up on his dreams. After years of applying for coaching positions, he was finally hired as head coach in 2014 and strives to be a messenger of hope for his students.", "article": "(CNN)On the basketball court, Karl Turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane. He'll get so caught up in the moment that he'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying. He's in the zone. Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players. \"Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams,\" says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers. All that changed on January 21, 1994. That night, the 14-year-old watched the Chicago Bulls beat his Pacers in an intense game. He walked to bed. He woke up paralyzed. He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again. \"Most patients do not recover well,\" said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital. A turning point came when Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' all-star player and Turk's favorite basketballer, heard about what Turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital. Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories. The basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces, similar to the ones Turk was wearing at the time. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out. \"Reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who I was,\" Turk said. \"For that moment, I felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness.\" It's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams. There was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance. Turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane, which he continues to walk with today. \"I keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where I have come from,\" said Turk. Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations. \"When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can,\" Arrow, now retired, told CNN. \"But he gets the job done no matter what.\" All Turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team. But it wasn't so easy. From 2009 to 2010, he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions. He only received one interview. The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching. \"I knew my resume was competitive,\" he said. \"I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone.\" He began to wonder if \"having a cane and an unusual gait\" would prevent him from ever coaching. In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve. In 2010, he was hired as assistant coach at West Oso. And in 2014, almost 10 years after moving to Corpus Christi, he became the head coach. He has strived to embody the ideals that Reggie Miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital. \"I want my students to know that I care about them, that I work for and belong to them,\" said Turk. \"So often, it's the messenger more than the message, I want to be the messenger that my students embrace.\" In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games. There isn't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down, and he"}

He also praised Louis van Gaal for bringing discipline to the team and encouraged his Belgian teammate Adnan Januzaj to work harder to get back into the national team. Finally, Fellaini believes that he has been able to prove himself this season and is now enjoying his football.", "article": "Marouane Fellaini says it is 'nonsense' to suggest that Manchester United are turning into a route-one team by taking advantage of his height and power. Louis van Gaal has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in Belgium midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker, and it proved effective once again when United won 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a Champions League place. It has also led to criticism of United's tactics, with even West Ham boss Sam Allardyce labelling Van Gaal's team 'Long Ball United' after Fellaini's physical presence helped snatch a 1-1 draw at Upton Park last month. Marouane Fellaini (challenging Emre Can on Sunday) has slammed Manchester United's critics. Louis van Gaal's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut Premier League season. But Fellaini said: 'It is nonsense that our game system is based on me. Our system is based on many good players. 'We play a beautiful football. We play forward, scoring, putting on pressure. There are great players around.' Fellaini came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under David Moyes last season after following his old Everton boss to United in a \u00a327.5million deal, but can also play as a box-to-box midfielder. The 27-year-old admits it would be easier to pin down one position but is just grateful to be playing after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford. 'Fellaini is at his best when he plays,' he added. 'It does not matter where. This season we have played many different tactics: 3-5-2, 5-3-2, 4-2-2-2, 4-3-3. Of course, it would be easier to play in one position, but you have to always adjust to the coach. I play, that's the main thing. 'I can play in different positions. Number six, number eight or as a second striker. At eight, I can go back and forth and arrive in the box. Second striker I played at Everton. At United it's different because I play in a triangle in midfield. It's simple: I adjust myself to the system of the coach.' Fellaini admits that strict disciplinarian Van Gaal is exactly the kind of character United needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the Premier League under Moyes last season. Fellaini's performances are vastly improved under Van Gaal (pictured scoring against Tottenham this month) It looked as though Fellaini would be one of the first players out of the exit, but Van Gaal reassured him that he could still have a future at United when he arrived last summer. 'He told me \"prove yourself and we'll see\". Now they are counting on me. There were never any real doubts. I was injured at the beginning of the season and then returned. 'The coach gave me confidence and I proved myself in a few matches. After that, I was injured and I got sick again. For three weeks I was on antibiotics. It took a while, but now I can finally enjoy. 'The coach is very strict, but that's good. We needed such a coach. Last season we had a bad season. We even missed European qualification. We needed a coach who would put some players' feet back on the ground. Fellaini also backed Belgium team-mate Adnan Januzaj (far right) to make an impact at Old Trafford. 'If he says something, you should do it. Otherwise you'll fly out of it. If he has to take you off the pitch when the game hasn't been going on for more than 30 minutes he'll do it. Or during half-time. Fortunately, it hasn't happened to me yet.' Fellaini had some words of encouragement for his Belgian compatriot Adnan Januzaj who has struggled to make an impact under Van Gaal. The 20-year-old's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the Belgium squad for the forthcoming games against Cyprus and Israel. 'He has accepted his current situation,' said Fellaini. 'I try to help him. He knows he must play if he wants to come back for Belgium. It is part of growing up. He will now work harder to try to come back to the national team.'"}

Areas in most demand include Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington.", "article": "Wealthy renters have paid \u00a3100 million up-front this year alone to cover their entire tenancy as competition for ideal homes intensifies, it was revealed today. With six or seven people chasing every top London property, bidders are desperate to beat their rivals to seal the deal on a home. As a result they are willing to pay a full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front - handing over \u00a3200,000 on average to the landlord. Areas in most demand: A map shows the top ten locations for up front rental payments in London. This is based on figures from Dataloft, which says the average prime London home costs \u00a33,500 per week to rent. In total, around \u00a3100 million has been paid up front in the first ten weeks of 2015, which is twice as much as the same period last year. The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine, according to letting agents E J Harris. Stamp Duty has also turned vendors into landlords and buyers into tenants as the central London \u00a32 million to \u00a320 million sales market has stalled. A number of these rich people are happy to pay their entire tenancy up front despite the properties costing them around \u00a310,000 per week. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, above, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. The top ten locations for up front rental payments are Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. Elizabeth Harris, managing director of E J Harris, said: 'The dramatic rise in up front tenancy payments is driven by several factors. 'Stamp Duty and mansion tax concerns has turned purchasers into tenants and so competition has risen for the best homes which has led to a rise in up front bids. A photo taken on Eaton Place in Belgravia - the area in London came second in the top ten list of up front rental payments. 'The London lettings market has become increasingly international with a new wave of wealthy tenants from Russia, Ukraine, Nigeria and China who are happy to pay their rents entirely up front. Estate agent\u00a0Tunstall Lettings had one case where a young woman in China paid \u00a34million up front for five years for a property in One Hyde Park. E J Harris had another case of a wealthy Nigerian paying more than \u00a31million up front to rent a property in Mayfair. 'Despite new lettings coming onto the market, the speed at which new lettings instructions are getting tenant offers has increased dramatically, so the number of available lettings properties is actually lower at the end of each week.' The mad market has been highlighted by a number of eye-opening deals. A one-bedroom Mayfair apartment was snapped up by a desperate tenant in a record-breaking 40 minutes. An a wealthy young man paid \u00a3400,000 up-front to rent a luxury flat only to love the place so much he bought it three days later - for more than \u00a310 million. Mark Tunstall, managing director of Tunstall Property, added: 'They have the financial wherewithal to sidestep the referencing requirements usually imposed by landlords by offering up-front lump-sum payments. 'Whilst global interest rates remain at historical lows it is of little consequence if those with substantial liquid cash reserves have to pay their rent in advance. 'And similarly, it doesn't confer the benefits on landlords that it used to do, when they would often accept a discount on the asking rent in return for the benefit of a slug of cash which they could then invest profitably elsewhere.' Knightsbridge came third on the list of top ten areas where money is paid up front for property rental."}

The preacher stood on a step ladder  in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall on Saturday afternoon ahead of the city's Mardi Gras parade before a group of buskers started to drown him out. 'Before I could look up, people were surrounding him and few of them were happy,' the musician told Daily Mail Australia. According to Mr Winter, the hateful messages quickly became aggressive and soon started to cause a lot of tension in the crowd. 'It was Mardi Gras - not only a day to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights, but also equality and unity towards all people,' he said. Mr Winter and several other buskers - Jarne, Joe, Mex and Ollie - grabbed their equipment and set up their loudspeakers right behind the preacher in a bid to drown him out.

'My whole life until I was 11, I was told that homosexuals are \"the devil's work\" and it's a \"sin\".

The Baggies defender was dismissed by Neil Swarbrick instead of teammate Michael Dawson who sent Wilfried Bony crashing to the floor when he was clean through. After the match an incredulous Pulis said: 'I can't believe he's picked the wrong player - it's beyond me.' Tony Pulis has called for the introduction of video technology to help referees after Neil Swarbrick's error. Swarbrick showed a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute after a foul on Wilfried Bony. West Brom defender Craig Dawson (right) makes the original challenge on Bony just outside the penalty area. The Ivorian striker heads to the ground under Dawson's clumsy challenge but managed to continue. Bony continues but McAuley  comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area. Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player. He added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced. 'It is no good moaning about referees,' Pulis said. 'We have to find a way to help referees out I would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video. 'The clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards. It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world. The sooner that comes in the better.' BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him. A difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from Wilfried Bony, Fernando and David Silva wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are, for now, three points behind leaders Chelsea who have two games in hand. City manager Manuel Pellegrini reflected on a morale-boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at Burnley and then bow out of the Champions League at Barcelona. 'Of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game,' he said. 'We lost the last two games in different competitions, Wednesday in Champions League and the last game against Burnley in Premier League. It is important to return to victory.' Fernando (centre) scored City's second of the match after Bony's opener and before David Silva added a third. The Chilean added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on Jose Mourinho's leaders. 'We are not thinking about that,' he said. 'I spoke with the players, we play now eight games more. We can win the eight games and if Chelsea doesn't drop points, we cannot win the title. The important thing is not to think about other teams, it is to think about our team, to improve and win the next game against Crystal Palace.'"}
{"abstract": "Wisconsin and Connecticut are the only two states with laws that require an investigation of officer-involved deaths to be conducted by an outside agency. This law is intended to ensure unbiased investigations and to address public suspicion of police corruption. However, there are political and financial obstacles to implementing such laws, and some worry that they could work against minorities.", "article": "(CNN)When an officer kills an unarmed suspect, the question arises time and again: Can a police department investigate a high-stakes case involving one of its own, without bias? For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. \"The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,\" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. \"I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,\" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. \"We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that.\" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires \"an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. \"Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,\" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. \"This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. \"Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,\" she said. \"There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed.\" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. \"Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,\" he said. \"And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.\"There are \"powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,\" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. \"For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,\" he said. \"If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system.\" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.  The"}

{"abstract": "Liverpool have made remarkable progress since their December defeat at Old Trafford, going unbeaten in the Premier League this year and boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. This success is due to Brendan Rodgers' tactical triumph in changing his system to fit the players he has, as well as the team's hard work and determination. The defenders have looked more assured, with Martin Skrtel proving himself a leader, and Emre Can and Simon Mignolet also impressing.", "article": "The progress Liverpool have made since that defeat at Old Trafford in December has been nothing short of remarkable. They remain the only unbeaten team in the Barclays Premier League this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal. Clearly, it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager Brendan Rodgers. Not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without Luis Suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at Anfield. That is no easy task, as Roberto Martinez and Louis van Gaal would probably testify. Simon Mignolet dives to spectacular deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson during Liverpool's 1-0 win on Monday. Emre Can has slotted in well in defence after Brendan Rodgers changed his system. Brendan Rodgers (left), Colin Pascoe (centre) and Mike Marsh talk tactics on the Liverpool bench. Liverpool have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth. Should they beat Swansea on Monday then they will be just two points off fourth place. D - 2-2 Arsenal (H) W - 1-0 Burnley (A) W - 4-1 Swansea (H) D - 2-2 Leicester (H) W - 1-0 Sunderland (A) W - 2-0 Aston Villa (A) W - 2-0 West Ham (H) D - 0-0 Everton (A) W - 3-2 Tottenham (H) W - 2-0 Southampton (A) W - 2-1 Man City (H) W - 2-0 Burnley (H) W - 1-0 Swansea (A) But watching Liverpool at Swansea on Monday night, their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players. Yes, there is no doubt the decision to move Emre Can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder \u2013 was quite brilliant. Can has been superb in the role alongside Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho, who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence. The decision to drop Simon Mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by Rodgers. How a player responds is of the utmost importance and Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper, much like we saw with Joe Hart at Manchester City, has returned with greater focus and determination. Against Swansea he made some marvellous saves, in particular to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That said, Liverpool\u2019s defence also demonstrated against Swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake. There was a moment at The Liberty Stadium, which led to the Mignolet save to deny Gomis, when a neat exchange of passes between Swansea\u2019s French striker and Wayne Routledge left a gaping hole in Liverpool\u2019s back three. In the press box we do not have the benefit of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville\u2019s tactical analysis but I can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half-time. This is where Liverpool have also been riding their luck a little; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of Jordan Henderson\u2019s winning goal. Jordan Henderson (right) scored Liveprool's winning goal after a lucky deflection. But football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances. It points to the fact that Liverpool, having started the season so poorly, are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the Champions League places. They are defending as a team, with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made. Neil Taylor tested Can on Swansea\u2019s left flank but it was Henderson who was there to make one important interception, even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the England midfielder the first yellow card of the night. When Gomis burst past Skrtel later in the game, it was Joe Allen who was there to cut out the shot. Desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and Rodgers declared his side\u2019s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does. VIDEO Monk rues missed chances. Mamadou Sahko (right) puts in a challenge on Jonjo Shelvey as he again impressed for Liverpool.

According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days. Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.'

He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station. Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out. In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show. The following year, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman. During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, the comedian, whose mother is a black South African and father is a white Swiss, discussed race and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests across the United States over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart his arms were 'tired' because he had been constantly 'holding them up' since he had arrived in America.

Barbaric: Islamic State militants dealt yet another blow to Christian history in Iraq this week by using explosives to destroy the 4th Century Mar Benham monastery. Mar Benham monastery was captured by ISIS last July in a lightning advance that saw the militants seize control of vast swathes of northern Iraq - including the country's second largest city, Mosul. Resident monks who live in the building - which is also known as the Monastery of the Martyrs Saint Behnam and his Sister Sarah, and was once visited by thousands of Christians and Muslims every year - were subsequently forced to leave and flee to nearby Christian villages. The destruction of the religious building was subsequently confirmed by Barzan Sadiq, executive producer at Kurdish Rudaw media network, according to the International Business Times.

There was a'manifest pattern of attacks' by Islamic State on Yezidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq. The U.N. investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September.

Given that cities are lit up 24-hours-a-day in many developed countries, there are fears that such ecological impacts may be widespread.

This image shows the\u00a0two different types of light treatment used -\u00a0\u2018white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating a type of sodium street lamp. Researchers from the University of Exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night. They exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a \u2018white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the UK and further afield. The experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid. The low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid-summer. The study showed that\u00a0low intensity amber light caused by street lighting in cities (a stock image of London at dusk is shown) prevented flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid summer. Bright lights in Europe\u2019s cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins. Animal biologists from Glasgow University and the Max Planck Institute for Orntihology in Seewiesen, near Munich, fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of Munich and in a nearby forest. The light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts. They found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average. The additional light had an effect on the city birds\u2019 photoperiod, which is the part of the day that organisms use to time their daily and seasonal biology. As a result, the birds in early March experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late March, according to the study published in journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. The city birds\u2019 perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds. Study leader Dr Davide Dominoni of the university, said: \u2018Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals. \u2018The global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species, but we\u2019re very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night.' They found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-August due to the limited amount of food available. Professor Kevin Gaston, Director of the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) said: \u2018These are the first findings from major long-term experiments \u2026 and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms.\u2019 Dr Jonathan Bennie added: \u2018Our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs. \u2018While we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night, we show that they may have more permanent, widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.\u2019 Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don\u2019t like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street-lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat. The findings have important implications for conservation, overturning the previous assumption that common bats benefited from street-lights because they could feed on the insects that congregated around them. The research, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that the activity of soprano pipistrelle, noctule and serotine bats was similar or lower in areas with street lighting compared with dark areas. An increase in the activity of the UK\u2019s most common bat, the common pipistrelle, was only seen in locations where there was also a high amount of shelter from trees or hedgerows. The only species for which lighting appeared favourable was Leisler\u2019s bat, a species common in Ireland but rare in"}

Children conceived using assisted reproductive technology were more likely to develop autism than babies conceived naturally. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes any type of fertility treatment where the egg and the sperm are handled outside of the body, including IVF, artificial insemination and surrogacy. During IVF - the most popular ART treatment - more than one egg is harvested and fertilised, which can lead to multiple births. Babies conceived through IVF (pictured) are more likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally, a study found. But this could be due to the complications of IVF, such as multiple births. Researchers explained they found an association between IVF and autism - but they did not prove that the treatment cause the disorder,\u00a0according to HealthDay news. The higher risk of the disorder could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with IVF, not the treatment itself, they said. After taking into account factors such as the mother's education and multiple births, researchers found the increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old. And they found there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child. This means IVF using a single-egg transfer rather than multiple eggs lowers the chance of a baby developing autism, experts said. The study involved nearly six million children born from 1997 to 2007. The team, led by Peter Bearman, a professor of social sciences at Columbia University in New York City, collected data on 5.9 million California births, including 48,865 infants conceived through assisted reproduction, and 32,922 children with autism. Autism is mainly caused by a child\u2019s genes, a major study of British twins has found. Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King\u2019s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. They compared the incidence of autism in births that involved advanced infertility treatment such as IVF and those that didn't. Professor Bearman said this was the largest study looking at this relationship that has ever been carried out. The results are not a condemnation of IVF technology, as the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link, he said. He added: 'There is an association between IVF and autism, but when we control for the characteristics of women who are more likely to use IVF, for example, age and social status, this association is lessened significantly,' The remaining increased risk is due to factors such as multiple births and complications of pregnancy and delivery associated with IVF, he said. He added that there was no significant increased risk of the disorder for children of women who gave birth to one child. He said: 'Knowing that one can largely reduce the risk of autism by restricting the procedure to single-egg transfer is important for women who can then make better informed decisions.' The research was published online in the American Journal of Public Health. The news comes after a major study published this week found genetics are the main cause of a child's autism, not lifestyle.

The show, which premiered in 2013, is known for pushing the envelope and has been heavily criticized for it by right leaning organizations such as One Million Moms which had called for the show to be boycotted even before it aired. The group, which has routinely advocated against the depiction of same-sex couples in the media, stated: 'While foster care and adoption is a wonderful thing and the Bible does teach us to help orphans, this program is attempting to redefine marriage and family by having two moms raise these children together.

Since the financially struggling city broke away from the Detroit water system last year, residents have been unhappy with the smell, taste and appearance of water from the city's river as they await the completion of a pipe to Lake Huron. They also have raised health concerns, reporting rashes, hair loss and other problems. A General Motors plant stopped using the water, saying it was rusting its parts. Officials say recent state tests show the water meets federal safety guidelines, and the city will be better off free of the leviathan Detroit system once the pipeline is complete by 2016. And while many Detroit suburbs have long dreamed of breaking their dependence on the city's water, further-away Flint is the first to risk it \u2014 and test whether the potential savings are worth going it alone.

'Unfortunately, some of our problems aren't quickly or easily solved,' said Jerry Ambrose, Flint's state-appointed emergency manager, adding that the 'challenges' resulting from the temporary reliance on the river 'were greater than we expected.' 'The potential to leave (Detroit) was well-supported by a business case, and in the long-term will benefit this region as well as the city of Flint,' Ambrose said. While there won't be'magical reductions' in rates, he said, cost increases should be much less. Flint had long chafed at the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department's rising prices. Flint officials estimated the cost of buying water from Detroit this year at $16 million, and the overall annual cost of switching to the new Karegnondi Water Authority would be $12.5 million. Still, the long-discussed divorce has brought real and figurative headaches. Tests released last week show the water is safe, but complaints from residents persist. They say the water looks brown or rusty, and tastes and smells of chlorine. People have protested at council meetings, held community hearings, hosted water giveaways and marched through downtown. Facebook pages have been forums for complaints and concerns. Last month, the county started distributing bottled water to about 1,300 preschool students and a children's museum recently blocked access to water fountains, citing Safe Drinking Water Act violations because of high levels of a disinfectant byproduct. High bacteria levels forced boil-water advisories last year. Resident Tony Palladeno Jr., 53, said he gets bottled water from a grocery store or spring water from his cabin further north, but uses city water for showers. 'No matter what, if I go in, one time it's going to be my eyes, or I'll get headaches or my lungs,' he said, adding that he's lost hair and produces a bottle of it to illustrate.

Police chiefs today announced that they have arrested 56 people - all Brits, including the three alleged leaders - and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims. And they said they feared thousands more would now be identified following a series of Costa del Sol raids against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. Detectives detailed the lengths the fraudsters went to dupe victims into handing over cash at a press conference in Malaga this morning. The three-tier scam involved calls from fake lawyers and court officials who persuaded their victims to hand over up to \u00a335,000 after being conned into selling their timeshares. Scroll down for video. Hotspot: The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol (pictured) The chief alleged ringleader, a Brit living in the resort of Mijas, had three homes and a boat and drove two luxury cars he is thought to have bought with his ill-gotten gains. Nearly 80 bank accounts linked to the gang have been frozen and six vehicles seized along with the boat and properties valued at nearly \u00a3600,000. Lead investigator, Inspector Mercedes Perez Quesada, said: 'The fraud was three-fold. 'Telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of Spanish law once they'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees. 'Any excuse to get money out of them was valid. 'Once victims had been conned and knew they were never going to get their money back, a second group of people would call claiming to be lawyers saying they were going to launch a group action on behalf of victims and asking once again for money upfront. 'The third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements. 'The scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between \u00a335 and \u00a335,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between \u00a33.5 million and \u00a34.5 million a year. 'The telesales operators were at the bottom rung of the fraud but knew exactly what was going on. 'The next level up were front men paid to open bank accounts so it made it more difficult to find out where the money had gone. 'They would receive commissions on the transfers of up to \u00a3360...Money collectors working for the three alleged ringleaders would collect up to \u00a32,150 from each front man on a daily basis and pass it on to their paymasters. 'The leaders were the brains behind the operation and the final recipients of the money... They started the operation we have smashed in 2009. Concern:\u00a0Police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the Costa del Sol (pictured) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol. Much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts. Two of the three alleged leaders were arrested along with 36 other suspects in raids in February during the first phase of the operation. The man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to Spain from the UK. A judge at a court in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola is now coordinating an ongoing criminal investigation. He is probing 11 companies believed to have been set up to facilitate the fraud. Two men including the alleged ringleader have been remanded in jail after a closed court hearing and the remainder released on bail. None of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under Spanish law, but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and membership of a criminal gang. Inspector Perez said: 'We know so far this organisation defrauded 500 British victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims.' Police also admitted the alleged ringleader had been arrested before for similar offences. They were not able to say whether he had been convicted in court. Malaga police chief Pedro Garijo Torres said: 'We don't want to comment on things that escape our control. 'The important thing for us was the police operation which is of huge significance in an area like Malaga whose economy relies so heavily on tourism and foreign visitors.'

Broad and Anderson have not been able to take early wickets, and England need all their players to perform if they are to have any chance of success in the tournament.", "article": "If Eoin Morgan wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all England\u2019s many under-achieving World Cups then he made a good job of it. The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. The subject of England\u2019s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation. Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval. England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday. England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh. \u2018Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.\u2019 Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains? Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance\u2019s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England\u2019s first World Cup game against Australia. England warm up during a nets session at the Adelaide Oval where they will meet Bangladesh. Chris Jordan (left) is held back at the Adelaide Oval as he and his team-mates get prepared. Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. \u2018The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018There wasn\u2019t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won\u2019t be taken lightly nor quickly.\u2019 No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England\u2019s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament. If England really are determined not to pick Hales \u2014 and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer \u2014 then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again. Ravi Bopara (right) and Eoin Morgan of England look on during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval. Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores. England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh. The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three. Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult one really,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven\u2019t been able to take early wickets.\u2019 England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh \u2014 who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off \u2014 at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering. However, upsets do happen and Bangladesh have the ammunition to cause one. The simple truth is, at the moment, England do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here. And they don\u2019t need an analyst to tell them that."}

It turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us. Gross, 65, has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in Cuba by traveling abroad, attending the State of the Union address as a guest of the Obamas and last week meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win Gross' freedom. After five years of being disconnected from the outside world, Gross now frequently posts on social media, writing of family reunions, eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in Cuba. \"I can't get away from Cuba,\" Gross wrote after hearing a Cuban song playing in an airport on his travels. While visiting Israel, he posted a photo of Cohiba cigars advertised for sale in a Tel Aviv tobacco shop. In 2009, Gross was arrested by Cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island. Gross said he was merely helping the island's small Jewish community get online, but Cuban officials accused of him being part of a U.S. government plot to destabilize the island's single-party Communist government. Cuba has highly restricted Internet access, and most people are not able to access the Web in their homes or on their phones. On December 17, 2014, Gross was freed, along with three Cuban intelligence agents and a Cuban man convicted of spying for the United States. It was part of a deal between the Cuban and U.S. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of Cold War animosity. Gross, his wife, Judy, his attorney and three U.S. congressmen flew from Havana to his home state of Maryland aboard a U.S. military jet, one of the smaller versions of Air Force One used to transport President Barack Obama. The image of Gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with CNN reporting the news of his release on a TV screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @AlanPGross Twitter page. The night of his release, he enjoyed a meal of spicy Thai food with family and friends, a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison. In January, Gross changed the status of his Facebook page to read that he had left his job as \"hostage\" at the Carlos Finlay military hospital where had been held in Havana. Later, he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in Cuba. With his dental concerns met, he moved on to food. Gross also recounted savoring long-denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese. Many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence: Gross renewing an expired driver's license or visiting a Starbucks for the first time in five years. But in other posts, he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in Israel, seeing the snow fall in Washington and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the Internet. A spokeswoman for Gross turned down a CNN request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat representing the Maryland district Gross hails from, called it \"incredibly moving\" that a man who spent five years in a Cuban prison has since sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and met the pope. More than that, he's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in Washington and Havana. \"Alan did not ask for this special role in history,\" Van Hollen said, \"but he's become a catalyst for this new chapter in American and Cuban relations.\" The photos that Gross posted online show a smiling man, slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison, no longer the gaunt-faced, hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in Cuba. \"The distance we've come since December 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey,\" Gross wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. \"For which we're grateful.\""}

He will be replaced in the back row by Samuela Vunisa, who moves from openside flanker, with veteran Mauro Bergamasco handed the number seven shirt. Sergio Parisse is tackled by France's prop Rabah Slimani and centre Gael Fickou at the Olympic Stadium. Parisse grimaces as he leaves the pitch during the Six Nations match between Italy and France. Parisse has not recovered from the foot injury and will miss Italy's final game of the Six Nations.

And there is also a chance in the front row for Ghiraldini's Leicester colleague Michele Rizzo, who replaces the injured Matias Aguero. Highly-experienced forwards Quintin Geldenhuys and Robert Barbieri, meanwhile, are on the bench. Saturday's encounter will be a third home game for Italy in this season's tournament, but they have so far scored just three points at home, going down to France and also being beaten 26-3 by Ireland. They have, though, beaten Wales twice from seven previous Six Nations starts in Rome, even if the Azzurri - especially without Parisse - go into battle as huge underdogs. Wales are currently third in the table on points difference behind leaders England and second-placed Ireland, and realistically they need to better their record Six Nations win in Rome - 38-8, 10 years ago - to maintain hopes of a third Six Nations title during the past four years."}

Alex Salmond has threatened to bring down a Conservative minority government, even if David Cameron wins more seats than Ed Miliband. The former Scottish First Minister said the Scottish National Party would vote down a Tory Queen's Speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election. Latest polls suggest the SNP will gain dozens of seats in Scotland, depriving Labour of a majority and able to call the shots in Westminster. Mr Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration. The Tories said it was proof the SNP would'sabotage the democratic will of the British people' to install Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Speaking to the New Statesman magazine, Mr Salmond said the SNP could enter a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with Labour - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities. But he said it was more probable that it would offer its support on a vote-by-vote basis and would make amendments to any budget put forward by Ed Balls to introduce 'progressive tax measures'. With opinion polls suggesting the SNP are headed for dozens of gains from Labour and the Liberal Democrats north of the border, Mr Salmond - who is standing in the Gordon seat being vacated by veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce - would say only that he expects the party to win 'a barrel-load' of seats at Westminster. He predicted that Lib Dems would not be 'a big factor' in negotiations on forming the new government, as 'if the Liberals are reduced to half their MPs the last thing they're going to be doing is going into a coalition'. 'The surviving half will want to survive,' he said. This would mean the SNP, unionist parties from Northern Ireland and other smaller parties would be crucial to the outcome. Mr Salmond rejected Labour's argument that the party with the most seats after the May 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government, insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the Commons. 'The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we'd be voting against,' said Mr Salmond. 'So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that's Cameron locked out.\u00a0And then under the (Fixed-Term) Parliaments Act that the Westminster parliament's passed but nobody seems to have read, you'd then have a two-week period to form another government - and of course you want to form another government because this might be people's only chance to form another government.' The SNP would act to prop up a Labour government with Ed Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron wins more seats. Although Mr Cameron would remain incumbent Prime Minister until a new government was formed, the Act - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result, said Mr Salmond. The former SNP leader said he had 'no idea' whether a Labour government emerging from such a process would have Mr Miliband as its leader, and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the SNP so firmly. 'If I were him, I wouldn't have ruled it out,' said Mr Salmond. 'Nicola (Sturgeon, the SNP leader) has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely. But she didn't rule it out: she said it was highly unlikely... It's still highly unlikely.' Asked what he saw as the probable outcome, Mr Salmond said: 'I think probable would be vote-by-vote (support for Labour), and possible would be confidence and supply.' A new poll of voters in Scotland this week put Labour down to just 27 per cent, which\u00a0Professor John Curtice says could leave the party with just two MPs, the same number as the Tories. Mr Salmond said it was 'bad politics' for Mr Cameron to float the prospect of English votes for English laws on the morning after last year's independence referendum and said it was now 'not a question of if, but when' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the UK would take place. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. 'That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune. The only way to protect Trident, keep Britain together and safeguard the economy is to vote Conservative.'"}

Nine years - and five grandchildren - later, the 68-year-old retiree from New Jersey is still going strong, and all thanks to an experimental treatment involving a common vaccine. Hillburn, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the Duke University Medical Center. Researchers found that a dose of tetanus vaccine let patients like Hillburn live longer when added to an experimental treatment for the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor,. Beating the odds: In April 2006, when Sandy Hillburn was diagnosed with glioblastoma - the most common and deadly kind of brain tumor - she was given only two-three months to live. Matriarch: Thanks to an experimental treatment involving the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine, Hillburn (top center) got to witness the birth of five more grandchildren. It 'put the immune system on high alert,' paving the way for the experimental treatment to work better in attacking the disease, said researcher Kristen Batich of the Duke University Medical Center. In a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature, she and others describe a study of 12 patients. Some who got the tetanus shot lived years longer than those who didn't. Dr. John Sampson of Duke, senior author of the report, called the results promising but noted the study was small, and said bigger studies are needed to confirm the results.  A follow-up study has already been planned but isn't recruiting patients yet, Batich said. Brain cancer experts unconnected with the work were impressed. The results are'very exciting,' said Dr. Nader Sanai of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. While he agreed more work is required, 'what you have so far, it's a very positive story.' Tetanus is otherwise known as lockjaw.  Vaccines for it are routinely recommended for children and adults. The new study focused on glioblastoma, which killed Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2009. Even after surgery to remove the tumor, it usually grows back and kills. The few drugs to treat these tumors have little effect. Half of patients die within about 15 months. When diagnosed in New York in April 2006, 'I was told I had two to three months to live,' Sandra Hillburn recalled in a telephone interview. But her family flew her to Duke in North Carolina because of its reputation for glioblastoma care, and she was offered a slot in the experimental study. Cutting age treatment: Hillburn was one of 12 cancer patients who were given a tetanus shot as part of a new study conducted at the Duke University Medical Center. New approach:\u00a0Doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in the tumor. Then they return the cells to the patient's body, where they train the immune system to go after the cancer cells and kill them. 'I was very positive it would help,' Hillburn said. 'I said, \"Sure, thank you.\" I'm still saying thank you.' In the years since then, she has attended her son's wedding and gained five more grandchildren. Now she plays soccer with six grandsons in Ohio and Boston. 'I look forward to seeing the wonderful people they're becoming,' she said. She continues to visit Duke once a month for more cell injections. Last November, she celebrated her 100th treatment. Dr Sampson said it's not clear why she has lived so long. Hillburn credits the treatment and her medical care at Duke. She also cited the example of her father, who is a 97-year-old survivor of two kinds of cancer. 'He just went about his life, and so I did the same thing,' Hillburn said. At age 68, Hillburn, plans to continue beating the odds for years to come. 'I think I'm good for at least another 10 years,' she told CBS News. Living by example: Hillburn said her father is a 97-year-old survivor of two different types of cancer who continues to go about living his life, and she is doing the same. Looking ahead:\u00a0She continues to visit Duke once a month for more cell injections and hopes to celebrate her 80th birthday. Positive outlook: Hillburn said when she was offered to be in the study, she was sure the experimental treatment would help. The active senior says she is lucky because she can enjoy a normal life: play golf, take long walks every day and meet friends for lunch. The new research work that has so dramatically prolonged Sandy Hillburn's life is an example of a long-standing effort to harness the immune system to fight cancer, an approach called immunotherapy. The specific strategy it used is called a dendritic-cell vaccine. Doctors remove white blood cells from a patient and equip them with a chemical target found in"}

This doesn't include romantic evenings out or luxury holidays - but simply sharing the duties around the house. The basis of the argument is from a 2009 study by Constance T. Gager and Scott T. Yabiku, which measured The Relationship Between Household Labor Time and Sexual Frequency. Using the results, Sandberg and co-writer Adam Grany suggest: 'Men and women who work hard [together] play hard.' Sandberg suggested that if if a man wanted to do something nice - instead of buying flowers they should do the laundry. The piece continues by saying: 'A man who heard this was asked by his wife one night to do a load of laundry. He picked up the basket and asked hopefully, 'Is this Lean In (reffering to her latest book) laundry?' Choreplay is real.' Citing research from 2000, the pair add 'that when men do their share of chores, their partners are happier and less depressed, conflicts are fewer, and divorce rates are lower.' They also suggest children who spend more time being cared for by their fathers are happier, healthier and less likely to have behavioral problems. For men, being in the company of their young ones make them more patient, emphatic and less likely to drink or do drugs. In 2012 mother-of-two Sandberg was made Facebook's first female board member. The 45-year-old, citing results of a study based on\u00a0The Relationship Between Household Labor Time and Sexual Frequency, says: 'Men and women who work hard [together] play hard' (file picture)"}

It was very hard to keep her attention at the moment,\" Sawyer told CNN's Erin Burnett. \" And she was covered in blood. It was one of the most horrific crime scenes I have seen.\" The officer grabbed a pair of gloves and tried to find where she was injured. Michelle Wilkins was weak and in shock when police arrived. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. She didn't know at that moment that she had lost her child, but her ability to communicate the events helped save her own life. \"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location,\" Sawyer said. \"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now.\" The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. The 26-year-old Wilkins, who was seven months' pregnant, arrived at the seller's home Wednesday in Longmont. Stabbed in the stomach and bleeding, Wilkins called 911. Another officer, Phil Piotrowski, told CNN affiliate KDVR. that the scene was almost too much to bear. He had to take a moment to collect himself. \"When I walked in and looked at her for a short moment, I actually had to walk out for a second because my head wasn't able to wrap around it.\" Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed. \"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,\" Piotrowski said. Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, \"She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.\" But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who \"saved her own life.\" The fetus died, but the mother survived and \"is improving minute by minute, hour by hour,\" according to Chris Wilkins. She's reported to be in critical but stable condition. Dynel Lane, 34, a former nurse aide, is being held on $2 million bail while prosecutors weigh charges against her, including murder. Lane is accused of stabbing Wilkins and removing a female fetus. The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, \"We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.\" CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report."}

Scroll down for video. Terrifying footage has emerged of a young tourist who encountered a near-drowning experience. The 27-year-old told Daily Mail Australia he was holidaying Down Under four years ago at the age of 23 when this incident happened. 'I was actually treading the water waiting for my friends to join for over a minute very comfortably before the video was shot,' he said. 'The waves were just choppy - not really particularly scary but it was very much a case of bad timing.' When he showed his mother the footage after returning home, he said the video brought tears to her eyes. 'Mum started crying, whoops,' Orr told Daily Mail Australia. 'At one point when I was in the water, I realized I was in trouble and I was like \"my mum is going to be pissed!\" Patrick Orr, from  Massachusetts, posted a video of himself being swept through the rough tides Down Under.

Oh my f*****g god! Pat! Pat!' as she tells Orr to dive under the waves. 'Oh my god - you guys - now I'm freaking out!' the woman frantically said. 'Get the f*** out of there!' Struggling to escape to safety, Orr is seen being swept through the massive waves as he makes his way towards the cliff while more voices are heard  screaming and yelling out directions. As he gets closer to the cliff, Orr attempts to climb his way up the rocks but is seen being wiped out and knocked back into the water a number of times.

'Apparently it's a very common place to jump off the rocks and go swimming, but as we weren't locals we didn't realize that the water is usually completely flat and calm,' the caption said. 'Unfortunately, about thirty seconds after I jumped in while waiting for the other wimps to finally join me, a huge wave set hit.' Fortunately, Orr made it clear in the caption that he managed to get to escape safely with only minor injuries. 'Luckily, right after the video cuts out I climbed out and puked everywhere in safety.

Nicola Holding was described as a 'pillar of the community' for her role at St Boniface's church and pre-school in Plymouth, Devon. But she was secretly siphoning off money from church funds and spending it on herself, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Holding, 50, pleaded guilty to fraud two years ago, but repeatedly failed to turn up to be sentenced, blaming a variety of serious illnesses. Jailed: Nicola Holding has been sentenced to prison for stealing from the church where she was treasurer. Yesterday she was finally sentenced to two and a half years in prison after arriving at court in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets. She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes. Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen \u00a390,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just \u00a324,000. She said \u00a37,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and \u00a36,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school. In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow said:\u201d 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.\u201d' Victims: The congregation at St Boniface's church in Plymouth were betrayed by the fraud, a court heard. He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home. Jo Martin, defending, said: \u201c'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.\u201d'She said Holding would find prison life '\u2018extraordinarily difficult'\u2019 because of her ailments. Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes. 'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said. 'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults. \u201c'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave. Nicola was trusted implicitly.\u201d' Holding was wheeled out of court to begin her sentence at a prison which can cater for her medical condition."}

Republicans have attacked Mrs Clinton after it emerged that during her time as Secretary of State she used her own private email account to conduct official business. However an investigation by NBC news has uncovered evidence that Republican front-runner Jeb Bush used his own private email server while Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who also has White House aspirations, employed a similar system. Scroll down for video. Hillary Clinton, pictured on a C-17 military aircraft using her Blackberry, used a personal email address while Secretary of State provoking criticism that she was attempting to avoid proper scrutiny of her messages. Following the controversy involving Clinton, it has emerged that Jeb Bush and his staff used a private email server for some official correspondence, however many of these messages have been made public. In an effort to reduce the impact of the controversy, Mrs Clinton has released 55,000 email documents from her personal files to the government to determine whether she had sent any classified information using her personal server during her time as Secretary of State. State Department rules insist that non-classified but sensitive national security or diplomatic information can only be transmitted using secure servers. According to CNN, the Florida governor used an email address on his own jeb.org server for official and personal business. However, he has now released hundreds of thousands of emails in an effort to deflect criticism. Mrs Clinton is the 6/5 favourite to become the next resident of 1600 Pennsylvania \u00a0Avenue, while Jeb Bush is the most favoured Republican at 5/2 with Scott Walker trailing at 14/1, according to bookmakers Paddy Power. CNN claimed that there is now evidence that Jeb Bush and his staff used his personal email server to communicate while working on official Florida business. Scott Walker's spokeswoman attacked Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, even though he was forced to admit using a similar system while in office as a Milwaukee County executive. Kirsten Kukowski, who represents Walker's political committee, Our American Revival, said: 'Hillary Clinton's potential evasion of laws is something she should answer questions about. 'Wisconsin has a strong open records law with a broad presumption of access to records and the governor has very specific policies in place in his office to assure that the laws are complied with fully.' Two of Walker's associates were convicted of political campaigning on government time. Fellow Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker, pictured, has also been embroiled in the scandal. Tens of thousands of pages of emails collected by prosecutors as part of that investigation have been publicly released since the close of the probe. Walker was never charged or convicted as a result of the investigation. Walker's staff has said that no such secret network exists in the governor's office. And Walker said last year that when he became governor in 2011 he created a 'clear distinction between things that are political and official'. He insisted that in November 2011, after almost a year in office he introduced a policy that 'any campaign work should be done away from the Capitol or state office building', with staffers using their 'own phone, computer and personal email'. Clinton's email server, clintonemail.com was used in the aftermath of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate in the Libyan city Benghazi. A House of Representatives Select Committee is investigating the attack and has issued a subpoena for any emails concerning Libya on Clinton's personal servers. According to Jamal D. Ware, spokesman for the Select Committee: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation. 'The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.' Later Ware confirmed: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi is in possession of records with two separate and distinct email addresses used by former Secretary Clinton and dated during the time she was Secretary of State. 'Without access to the relevant electronic information and stored data on the server\u2014which was reportedly registered to her home\u2014there is no way the Committee, or anyone else, can fully explain why the Committee uncovered two email addresses. 'As Chairman Gowdy has noted, this is why former Secretary Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of personal emails to conduct official U.S. government business is so problematic and raises significant issues for transparency. The American people have a right to a full accounting of all the former Secretary\u2019s emails, and the Committee is committed to working to uncover all the facts.' Current Secretary of State John Kerry said his department is currently assessing the 55,000 documents released by Clinton vowing \u00a0that they \u00a0'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way'.

The film, presented by journalist Bill Emmott, starred comedian Angus Deayton as an archaeologist explaining the single currency to a young girl on an aeroplane heading for Berlin, after the collapse of the EU and the abolition of the euro. Mr Deayton laid out \u2013 with \u2018flashbacks\u2019 to 2014 \u2013 the reasons for the EU break-up.

Antonio Boporan Singh, 28, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder after two men were punched, kicked and one was hit with a champagne glass at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar. Singh, heir to a \u00a3130million chicken fortune, has already served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road in November 2006. Scroll down for video. Antonio Boparan Singh, right, pictured with his food tycoon father Ranjit, right at an earlier court appearance. The 28-year-old has been sentenced to a year in jail after attacking a man in a brutal bar attack. His latest jail sentence comes after a brawl at the upmarket Birmingham bar last April. During the fight, one victim, Jarondeep Kooner, was slashed across the face with a champagne flute by Theodore Mullings-Fairweather, who then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the man as he lay injured on the floor. Singh from Little Aston, West Midlands - who earlier paid \u00a3400 to secure a VIP table at the bar - left the club with Mullings-Fairweather and alongside Edward Ansah and Nathan Pringle. But as they walked into a nearby street the group saw a 31-year-old man with his shirt ripped. Assuming him to be part of the group involved in the fight, Mullings-Fairweather and Singh punched and kicked him to the ground before running off. The minute-long attack was captured on CCTV and left both victims, Harprit Singh and Mr Kooner, requiring hospital treatment. Mr Kooner, 22, suffered a fractured eye socket and has since lost use of an eye. Two men were punched, kicked and one hit with a champagne flute in the attack last April at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar, pictured. Singh had pleaded guilty to one count of inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder at Birmingham Crown Court in February, and was given one year in jail on Friday. Mullings-Fairweather, 25, from Selly Oak, Birmingham admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was jailed for eight years. He also received another eight years for a separate offence of robbery after stealing a cash box from outside a Tesco store. Singh's father Ranjit Singh Boparan owns 2 Sisters Food Group - a Birmingham-based food-manufacturing company. Established in 1993 as a frozen retail cutting operation, it has grown rapidly and expanded to cover 36 manufacturing sites in the UK, eight in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and one in Poland. The group employs 23,000 people, and has annual sales of \u00a33.4billion. It is listed 14th on the 2014 Sunday Times Top Track 100. The company is now the third largest food company in the UK by turnover. Brands include Fox's Biscuits, Goodfella's, Donegal Catch and Green Isle. Harry Ramsden's was sold to Boparan Ventures Ltd in 2010, the private investment branch of his business empire. Pringle, 32, from Erdington, Birmingham, and Ansah, 24, from Sutton Coldfield, both admitted violent disorder and were given 18 months imprisonment. Addressing Singh, Judge Simon Drew QC said: 'The assault occasioning actual bodily harm took place after the violent assault and should be considered entirely separate and was a gratuitous attack. 'It involved you kicking a man on the ground to the head. These courts regard that conduct as very serious.' Michael Wolkind, defending, said Singh had not been drinking that night and said he led a 'cautious' lifestyle. He added the 28-year-old had dedicated his life to the Boparan Charitable Trust, which helps sick children. After the hearing, Detective Constable Allan Jones, who led the inquiry, said: 'This was a violent attack which devastated the lives of two young men. 'Both needed extensive medical treatment and the 22-year-old has suffered permanent sight loss as a result of this group's actions. Singh had previously been jailed for 21 months for hitting the car Cerys Edwards was in while overtaking at 70mph in a 30mph area in November 2006. The youngster, now nine-years-old, was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive.

Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday. Hall said there was no evidence the unborn child survived outside of victim Michelle Wilkins' womb. Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said his office would not seek a murder charge against Lane, according to KTLA. Scroll down for video.

Under Colorado law, a person can be charged with murdering a baby only if there is evidence the baby was alive outside of the mother's body. 'At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb,' said Hall. 'Therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth. 'No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body. Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete.'

However, Cruz faces long odds of making it to the White House if he sticks to this strategy of extremism, as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades and the electorate is not likely to experience any dramatic swings. Additionally, Cruz's congressional obstructionism could hurt his favorability ratings during his campaign.", "article": "(CNN)Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will announce Monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president. Cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012. His announcement takes place at a bastion of  conservatism, Liberty University, the institution founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. Cruz is going to run from the right. He has spent much of his short career in Washington blasting the \"mushy middle\" of his party (which might be news to most Democrats), which he dismisses as a \"failed electoral strategy.\" During a recent visit to New Hampshire, where he vowed to eliminate the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue Service, Cruz said that \"I'm pretty sure, here in New Hampshire, y'all define gun control like we do in Texas: Gun control is when you hit at what you aim at.\" Fifty years ago, another Republican senator ran this kind of campaign, Arizona's Barry Goldwater, who took on President Lyndon Johnson. Cruz will test the conventional wisdom that Goldwater's strategy was and remains a failure. When Republicans voted to nominate him in 1964, Goldwater told the delegates that \"extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue.\" When the icon of moderate Republicans, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, spoke to the convention, the delegates hissed and booed. The outcome was far from great for the GOP. Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal Democratic majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred. Although Goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964, Cruz thinks that the times have changed. Is he right? Right now, the chances are not great. If Cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism, he faces very long odds of making it to the White House. The strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against Jeb Bush in red states, but it is not an approach with a great track record. Even as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades, Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination, and those who have also won the presidency, always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes. Ronald Reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent, and George H.W. Bush had a thousand points of light. His son George W. Bush emphasized policies tied to \"compassionate conservatism\" to prove that he was not an extreme zealot. Even Republicans who didn't win in the general elections, like John McCain and Mitt Romney, did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base. Notwithstanding the conventional wisdom, even in primaries it seems that Republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in November. This coming election will be tough for Republicans. As all the experts have shown, the electoral college math does not favor the GOP. Some experts have predicted that Democrats have over an 80% chance of winning the Electoral College. According to the Washington Post, if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election, five currently favor Democrats (Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania) while in others, like Colorado, Democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends, namely growing minority populations that favor their party's nominee. Barring any dramatic changes in the coming months, Democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in Hillary Clinton. Cruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate. The Republican Party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in Washington. In 2014, congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14%. As the new year began, the approval ratings were only slightly better: just 16%. This is the congressional Republicanism where Cruz comes from. Many voters who like conservatism and the GOP don't love what their representatives are doing on Capitol Hill. The kind of scorched earth, always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings. There have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as Cruz. During his campaign for the presidency, he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in Congress. When Goldwater squared off against Johnson in 1964, the President predicted that there would be a \"frontlash\" of Republican and independent voters who would move way from the GOP just because Goldwater was at the top of the ticket. This was Johnson's response to predictions of a backlash in the South from Democrats who were angry about civil rights. The frontlash, Johnson explained to Bill Moyers is \"liberals, independents, moderate Republicans.\" The electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in Midwestern states in 1964, where solidly Republican areas went Democratic because they were scared off by Goldwater, but a Cruz campaign could be exactly what Democrats"}
{"abstract": "Scientists have discovered the earliest fossilized evidence of an insect caring for its young, a female sap-sucking scale insect preserved in amber carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen. This discovery pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years and may help to explain how parental care first began to emerge. Plants can also sense what type of creature is attacking them and provide different defences based on the gene analysis.", "article": "It is a tender moment frozen in time for at least 100 million years. Scientists have uncovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young. The fossil shows a female sap-sucking scale insect, preserved in amber, carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen. The waxy ball like shapes on the abdomen of this 100 million year old insect Wathondra kotejai contain eggs and hatched nymphs and is thought  to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered. The fossil, discovered in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar, pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years. It is thought to be one of the earliest examples of parental care ever discovered and may help to explain how it first began to emerge. Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive \u2013 and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool. Researchers at the University of Missouri exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms. Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes. Based on the gene analysis, the scientists found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly. There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it. Professor Bo Wang, a palaeontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the research, said: 'Brood care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects, which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous period during the Mesozoic era. 'Although analysis seemed to suggest that ancient insects evolved brood care, this is the first direct, unequivocal evidence for the fossil record.' The insect Wathondra kotejai is thought to date from the mid-Cretaceous period and became encased in sap from a tree that over time turned into amber. Around its abdomin are around 60 eggs and freshly hatched nymphs, encased within a wax-coated egg sack, according to the research, which is published in the journal eLife. This primitive form of brood care would have protected the young nymphs from wet and dry conditions while allowing them to mature in the relative safety of their mother. Fossilised evidence of animals caring for their young is extremely rare, especially in insects. Wingless females were largely immobile, so were less likely to be accidentally buried. A cockroach from a similar period was reported carrying a mass of eggs, but cockroaches often deposit their eggs rather than brooding them. This drawing of a brooding female Wathondara kotejai shows the ovisac containing the brood and eggs coated in a wax covering as a lumpy mass on the main part of the insects body. Amber makes it almost transparent. Researchers believe Wathondara kotejai (above) may be one of the earliest insects to care for its young. Tiny hatched nymphs can be seen scattered aaround the mother insect's body in the amber in the image above. The only other direct evidence of brood care is from Cenozoic ambers, which are thought to only extend to around 65 million years ago. The latest discovery is thought to be at least 100 million years ago and dates from a time when dinosaurs dominated the Earth. The findings may help to offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects - small limpet-like suck saping insects that are common pests on plants today. The emergence of flowing plants and ants are thought to have been crucial for the rapid evolution of many new inspect species but were not present when scale insects began to evolve. Today many insects, such as ants and bees, care for their young, while the behaviour is far less common in mammals where just six per cent of species care for their young. The insect was found encased in amber in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar (shown above) Wathondara kotejai is an ancient ancestor this sap-sucking scale insect that are now common garden pests."}

None of the patients has been identified. The hospital said it would receive a fifth person who was part of the initial exposure in Sierra Leone later on Monday. The latest NIH patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. Two patients in the U.S. have died: a man treated in Dallas after contracting the virus in Africa and a doctor evacuated from Africa to Nebraska when he was already critically ill. The man in Dallas had contracted the virus in his native Liberia. He transmitted the disease to two nurses, resulting in widespread concern in the U.S., with questions raised about emergency department screening of patients, monitoring of ill travelers from Africa and even disputes over the disposal of potentially infectious waste from hospitals. The World Health Organization has estimated the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease. While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring. That includes four going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday. On Saturday, four health care workers arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and three arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda. One of those being monitored in Nebraska has developed symptoms of Ebola and was being moved to a biocontainment unit, hospital officials said in a news release on Monday. However, none of those being monitored has tested positive for Ebola. The National Institutes of Health said it has no other pending admissions of additional patients with the Ebola virus or who have been exposed to Ebola. CDC workers in Sierra Leone are involved in investigating the illness of the first patient, including looking for other people the person was in contact with.

'We want everyone to do well against their former club to show they are great players, but it is not aways easy to deal mentally with it. 'I only knew very late that he would play, but he has shown great mental strength. 'He just wants to win, he is a team player. He just wants to do well and he wants to produce s complete performance. 'He kept calm and De Gea made one or two outstanding saves.' Arsenal deserved to win and Wenger insisted that his team can respond to the challenge ahead as they target a sixth FA Cup since he became manager of the club. He also paid tribute to the 9,000 travelling Arsenal fans who made their way to Old Trafford on a Monday evening for this FA Cup quarter-final. Some of Arsenal's 9,000 travelling fans celebrate at Old Trafford after the final whistle. Van Gaal trudges towards the tunnel after seeing his side miss out on a place in the FA Cup semi-finals. He said: 'We started at a high tempo and without apprehension. We were in control. We could have scored more. 'The team was a bit down at 1-1 at half-time, because we felt that we should be winning. 'Mentally we were at the level I requested. It was a physical game, a committed game. We did that well without forgetting to play our football. 'Every win makes us stronger.

And now Kirstie Allsopp has opened the door to her own Notting Hill, West London, house to show she really does practice what she preaches. From the living room sofa that has been inherited, to the kitchen tops that were once used in a science lab, the wardrobe now used as kitchen storage and the fireplace that once caused her to burst into tears, Miss Allsopp's home is full of quirky collects. Scroll down for video. Kirstie Allsopp, pictured above in her Notting Hill home, is a household name for her thrifty interior ideas. And it should come as no surprise, as the face of shows such as Kirstie's Homemade Home and Location, Location, Location, the property expert knows a thing or two about transforming a living space. She and her partner Ben Andersen bought their London house, a 1950s property, in September 2006, a few months after her first son Bay, now nine, was born and set about turning it into a home. Talking about her house, which was once two flats which have been knocked together to create an open and airy family home, Miss Allsopp, 43, who also has a son Oscar, seven, and is step-mother to Ben's two sons, said: 'I can't think of anything that hasn't got some sort of story behind it. 'Someone asked me if I designed all this, but it's not like that. It comes together over time. You get things all the time and you are adding and taking things away.'

But I am actually going to have to basically get either a new sofa or swap this for another type of sofa soon.' 'Once you know you're not going to just buy something new, once you've made that decision \u2013 and I hate calling it an ethical decision because that makes it sound like you are really up your own bottom, but we have made an active decision not to go out and buy new things. That decision has been made.' The 'Blue Peter' fire place. 'I was pregnant with my first child and Ben took me to the Goldborne Road and there was this fireplace that he loved. I burst into tears because I just didn't know what else to do. It was a disgraceful performance on my behalf. 'I wept \"please no, let's not buy that fireplace\"'. I was so ashamed at my lack of backbone. \"I really don't think we should buy this fireplace\", I kept saying. I was so ashamed of myself. 'I bought the fireplace for a lot of money. I said to Ben \"I've bought the fireplace, when you have a building which needs a new fireplace and everything else, you can put it in and you are bound to need it at some point. I'm sorry I cried, it's a beautiful fireplace.

One policeman who was present during the attack said the police were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd, which grew throughout the attack.

'She said I am a Muslim and Muslims do not burn the Koran,' Shah \u00a0said. 'As more people gathered, the police were trying to push them away, but it got out of control. 'The people pulled her into a corner of the yard and beat her with sticks, and one man took a large stone and dropped it on her. That was the end,' Shah said. Farkhunda's body was then dragged 300 meters (980 feet) along the road in front of the mosque and thrown into the river, he said. Social activists on Monday planted a pine tree on the riverbank spot where Farkhunda's body was set alight. The demonstrators, many of them members of the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan, blocked the road outside the mosque and marched along the riverside route, starting from where the attack began. Many women in the crowd wore masks of Farkhunda's battered and bloodied face, which has appeared widely on social media. They carried a banner accusing the government of broking promises to end corruption and bring rule of law to Afghanistan. Palwasha, who described herself as a social activist, said: 'We demand that the government ensure that all those involved are arrested and that they face an open trial so that justice"}

Supermarkets have been accused of pursuing an \u2018anti- Christian agenda\u2019 after refusing to sell Easter eggs with a religious message. Some of Britain\u2019s biggest stores are celebrating the most profound event in the Church calendar by offering treats featuring everything from Darth Vader to Postman Pat \u2013 but turned down products that mention Jesus. One chain even asked \u2018what has Easter got to do with the Church?\u2019, according to the makers of The Real Easter Egg, which features Christian crosses on the box and contain a leaflet telling the story of the Resurrection. Now Archbishop of York John Sentamu has stepped in \u2013 urging Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and the Co-op to stock the charity eggs \u2013 while former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said he was \u2018saddened\u2019 by the three supermarket giants\u2019 decision.

I think it shows ignorance on the part of these supermarkets. \u2018By not offering an alternative to secular Easter eggs they are really undermining the real message of Easter. It saddens me because we are living in a land that is completely losing contact with its religious roots and is out of touch with the Christian message.\u2019 David Marshall, the head of the Meaningful Chocolate Company, said the supermarkets appeared biased against its \u2018proven seller\u2019. He said: \u2018We do wonder at times if there is an anti-Christian agenda from some of our supermarkets who just keep turning it down. It is as if some feel Christianity is politically incorrect or the Easter story, which mentions Jesus, might put people off. \u2018One buyer asked us what Easter had got to do with the Church, while another simply said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a credible product\u201d and asked us to leave.\u2019 The Warrington-based firm has spent five years trying to persuade stores to sell its \u00a34 Christian-themed eggs, which were launched in 2010 with the backing of Archbishop Sentamu. At first the supermarkets refused, but two years ago, Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose and the Co-Op bowed to pressure and agreed. But this year Sainsbury\u2019s and the Co-op have dropped the eggs, blaming poor sales, while Asda has never stocked them. However, the Meaningful Chocolate Company say a million eggs have been sold over the past five years. 'Poor sales': Sainsbury's and Co-op have cited poor sales as the reason they dropped the Eggs, while Asda said it has not be approached by the makers of the egg. Archbishop Sentamu, who has lamented ignorance about Easter after learning that a third of children thought it marked the birthday of the Easter bunny, said yesterday: \u2018With a million Real Easter Eggs sold I am delighted that Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose have met the challenge. I call on Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, and the Co-operative to give their customers the same choice.\u2019 Sainsbury\u2019s said their decision was based on \u2018the popularity of ranges in previous years\u2019, with the Co-op also citing \u2018poor sales of the Real Easter Egg in previous years\u2019.

'Current indications suggest a delay of between a few days. and several weeks,' a statement from the world's leading. particle physics research centre said on Tuesday. Engineers had been expected to start on Wednesday pumping. proton beams in opposite directions all the way round the two. 27-km (17-mile) underground tubes in the LHC, closed down for. the past two years for a refit. Scroll down for video. The LHC (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at CERN (European particle physics laboratory) near Geneva, Switzerland.   After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, it is about to ramp up for its second three-year run. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. That would have been the prelude to the start of particle. collisions in late May at twice the power of those in the LHC's. first run from 2010-2013. The smashing-together of particles inside the LHC is. designed to mimic conditions just after the Big Bang at the dawn. of the universe. In a breakthrough in 2012, CERN scientists. announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle, a basic. building block of the universe, which appeared to be the boson. imagined and named half a century earlier by theoretical. physicist Peter Higgs. Hopes for the second run lie in breaking out of what it. known as the Standard Model of how the universe works at the. level of elementary particles, and into 'New Physics.' That includes searching for the dark matter that makes up. about 96 percent of the stuff of the universe but can only be. detected by its influence on visible matter around it. CERN scientists expressed disappointment at the last-minute. problem, in just one of the underground machine's eight sectors,. which have been rewired and checked thoroughly during the. closedown. But the research centre's director general, Rolf. Heuer, played down its significance. 'All the signs are good for a great run 2,' he said in a. statement. 'In the grand scheme of things, a few weeks delay in. humankind's quest to understand our universe is little more than. the blink of an eye.' Scientists and engineers at CERN, mindful of a serious. leakage in 2008 which caused a delay of two years in the. start-up for the first LHC run, have long insisted that there. can be no rushing into full operations. Frederick Bordry, director for accelerators, said it could. take time to resolve what he described as an intermittent. short-circuit because it was in a cold section of the machine,. meaning that part would probably have to be warmed up. It would then have to be recooled. 'So what would have taken. hours in a warm machine could end up taking us weeks,' he added. Previously a Higgs particle has been created in an LHC detector and has then disintegrated into four muons (the four red lines). According to Dr Christoffer Petersson's model the Higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter. Scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe. Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May,  accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a Thursday news conference in Geneva. A test beam ran through the collider last weekend, he said. Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment. 'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' CERN General Director Rolf Heuer said. 'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.' Dark matter \u2014 and its cousin, dark energy \u2014 make up most of the universe, yet scientists haven't been able to see them yet, so researchers are looking for them in high-energy crashes, in orbit on a special experiment on the international space station, and in a deep underground mine.

{"abstract": "The White House has sent a strongly worded letter to Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) warning that a bill he is drafting to force the Obama Administration to submit any deal reached with Iran for a vote by Congress could have a \"profoundly negative impact\" on the negotiations. Secretary of State John Kerry has criticized a letter from 47 Republican senators that suggested any agreement reached would need congressional approval, calling it a \"direct interference with negotiations in the executive department\". Iran's speaker of parliament has also criticized the letter, saying it showed that the United States is untrustworthy.", "article": "Washington (CNN)In a strongly worded letter, the White House Saturday told Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) a bill he is drafting would likely have a \"profoundly negative impact\" on the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Corker is working on legislation that would force the Obama Administration to submit any deal reached with Iran for a vote by Congress.  The White House earlier threatened to veto such a measure. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, in the three page letter released publicly Saturday evening, told Corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with Iran by \"emboldening Iranian hard-liners, inviting a counter-productive response from the Iranian majiles (Majles, the Parliament); differentiating the U.S. position from our allies in the negotiations; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal.\" As the U.S. and Iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week, there has been a growing debate between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Obama Administration about how much authority Congress has regarding the fate of the agreement. \"The legislation you have introduced in the Senate goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran. Instead, the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that Congress must vote to 'approve' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the President,\" McDonough wrote. The chief of staff said that only Congress can terminate the existing Iran sanctions that are included in laws, but the President can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally. One of the major issues between the U.S. and Iran is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions. \"If congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal, it will create divisions within the international community, putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure Iran. Put simply, it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions, while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions\" now in place, McDonough said in his letter. For his part, Corker on Sunday released a statement: \"On this issue where Congress has played such a vital role, I believe it is very important that Congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented.\" Corker also urged the President not to go to the United Nations for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on Iran, as Reuters reported was being considered. \"Enabling the United Nations to consider an agreement or portions of it, while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable Congress to do the same, is a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress' appropriate role,\" he wrote. The chief of staff told Corker, \"The Administration's request to the Congress is simple: let us complete the negotiations before the Congress acts on legislation\" and added \"we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the United States.\" McDonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to Iran's leadership and signed by 47 Republican senators. Corker did not sign it. The letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval. It has generated much controversy. It also drew rebuttal from Iran's foreign minister, who called it a propaganda ploy. On Sunday, Iran's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, said the letter signed by the senators tarnished Washington's reputation internationally, according to state-run Tasnim news agency. He said it showed that the United States is untrustworthy, and he advised current negotiators to be wary. McDonough also said the letter's premise was incorrect. \"Non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with Iran...are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval,\" McDonough said. Secretary of State John Kerry, who heads back to Switzerland on Sunday for more talks with Iranian representatives, again blasted that letter from the 47 Republicans. \"It is a direct interference with negotiations in the executive department,\" he said at a news conference in Egypt. \"It is completely without precedent, and it is almost inevitable it will raise questions in the minds of the folks with whom we are negotiating.\""}

However her first love has always been art. Taking the plunge into the unknown, Smith decided to sell her business, say goodbye to her friends, and move to Mauritius to pursue a career as an artist full time. \"I was passionate about my business as well, it was amazing, my job was wonderful,\" Smith says, \"but I always wanted to be an artist since I was very, very young. A teacher put me off it at school and I didn't go down that road, and I regretted it.\" Smith chose Mauritius because she had fallen in love with the lush beauty of the tropical island on previous trips to visit her son, who lives there. Her studio, where she paints portraits and carves sculptures out of marble, clay and bronze, is by the sea, and Smith says she is endlessly inspired by the natural beauty of her adopted home. \"I go out every day driving around, every day you see things that are inspirational. Getting up in the morning I sit on the terrace, I look out to the sea, to the islands,\" she says. The artist, who goes by the moniker Lynni, says her new life is a dream come true, but a dream that she created not by wishing for it, but working to make it happen. \"If you want to do something you just have to get off your backside and do it yourself because nobody else is going to do it,\" she says. \"All my life I blamed that careers teacher and then I realized it was stupid to blamer her, it was my fault. I didn't follow my dream. And it got to the stage where I realized it's time to follow my dream,\" she adds."}

She had been receiving text messages from a work colleague and was fixated on work issues, including a promotion of a person she had problems with, before her death.", "article": "Caroline Bailey, 46 (pictured with her husband Neal Connor), worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but was found dead at a quarry after being bullied, an inquest heard. A senior RE teacher was found hanged at a quarry after claiming she was being bullied by other staff members at her secondary school, an inquest heard. Caroline Bailey, 46, worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but became stressed at work and began suffering panic attacks and insomnia. The mother-of-two ended up taking sick leave and made several attempts to self-harm during the school's summer holidays, the inquest in Oldham heard. She was later admitted to a psychiatric unit at Fairfield General Hospital, Greater Manchester. On the day of her death in September 2012, she told staff at the unit that she was going out to buy a newspaper but instead went to Castle Hill Quarry near Rochdale, where she was later found dead. The inquest heard how the tragedy occurred after Ms Bailey was appointed head of humanities at the school, where she was described by the headteacher as an 'outstanding classroom practitioner' who 'always put children first.' The hearing was told how she started talking about self-harm over undisclosed issues she had with a fellow teacher and was eventually prescribed anti-depressants. She became so stressed that she began locking herself in her own classroom to eat lunch at the school instead of joining her colleagues in the staff room. Her husband Neal Connor, 36, said she also began calling herself'stupid' after a fellow teacher was promoted above her and said: 'I have nothing.' Mr Connor, a recovery operator from Prestwich, said: 'She had been suffering from panic attacks while she was at work. She had felt them a couple of times while she was teaching. 'She had also felt the same sort of feeling when she had been in the presence of a couple of other members of staff as well, to the point that since December I noticed she had not been eating properly at home. 'She avoided going to the staff room on multiple occasions because she wanted her own time. She did not want to be in the presence of certain staff. She locked herself in her own class room for dinner. 'She had problems with members of staff at work and in my opinion it was a form of strategic bullying. 'There were ongoing issues from school and they were on her mind. She was made aware that a person was promoted above her position and she came out with comments like 'I have nothing,' and called herself'stupid.' In the months before her death, Ms Bailey was advised by her GP to seek counselling and also paid for her own hypnotherapy sessions. However, she ended up going on sick leave and began self-harming during the school's summer holidays. Neal Connor told the inquest in Oldham that he believed his wife Caroline (together above) was being subjected to'strategic bullying' at the school. He said she called herself'stupid' after a colleague was promoted over her. Following one instance of self-harm, her husband took her to A&E and doctors suggested that she be treated in a psychiatric unit at Fairfield Hospital. However, she begged not to be admitted as it was so close to the school where she worked. Mr Connor said: 'When she got to Fairfield that night she looked like a frightened child. She said she wanted to be anywhere except there. When she walked from the ambulance she was frightened of seeing someone she knew - she looked through every single window to see who was there. 'There were some boys from the school sat at the entrance to Fairfield and her biggest fear was the fact that she had taught there for that long that some of the kids she taught at 15 would be 25. 'The biggest fear would be that they recognised her but she would not recognise them and that it would go out into the community that she was at that sort of ward.' Following the treatment at hospital, Ms Bailey was allowed to return home for the weekend and appeared to improve. However, three days before her death, her condition worsened when she began receiving text messages from a work colleague, the inquest heard. Mr Connor added: 'There had been a lot of interaction that day with work colleagues who had been texting her. She struggled to reply to these texts. 'She had had several texts regarding work issues from a history teacher who was quite a close friend of hers. She was aware that Caroline had been pretty bad but not aware she was on a ward. 'They were lengthy messages and she struggled to reply to the messages and read through to make sure what she was writing made sense. 'She was fixated on work. There had been a promotion of a person she had problems with.

Now scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought. Researchers at Oxford University found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka. Scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought. Researchers at Oxford University found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of Sabaragamuwa in southern Sri Lanka (pictured) They say isotopes in the teeth suggest the people they belonged to had a diet mainly composed of food foraged from the forest. The study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago. Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. The findings add to mounting evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as. The findings contradict the idea that tropical rainforests were largely human-free environments until around 8,000 years ago. Professor Julia Lee-Thorp, an archaeologist at Oxford University who helped lead the study, said: 'The isotopic methodology applied in our study has already been successfully used to study how primates, including African great apes, adapt to their forest environment. 'However, this is the first time scientists have investigated ancient human fossils in a tropical forest context to see how our earliest ancestors survived in such a habitat.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Science, studied the fossilised teeth of 26 humans of a range of dates - from 20,000 to 3,000 years ago - found around Sri Lanka. The areas where they were excavated from are all now dense rainforest but it was not clear what the landscape was like when the people were alive. By examining the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the teeth, the researchers were able to see that the humans had a diet that matched those of people living in slightly open 'intermediate rainforest' environments. The study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago. Rainforests, like in Sri Lankan above, may teem with life but beneath the trees life can be hard for humans.\u00a0The findings contradict the idea that such rainforests were largely human-free until 8,000 years ago. The teeth were found in rainforests  in southern Sri Lanka including in the Batadombealena cave (marked) Patrick Roberts, an archaeology student at Oxford University and lead author of the study, said: 'This is the first study to directly test how much early human forest foragers depended on the rainforest for their diet. 'The results are significant in showing that early humans in Sri Lanka were able to live almost entirely on food found in the rainforest without the need to move into other environments. 'Our earliest human ancestors were clearly able to successfully adapt to different extreme environments.' Professor Mike Petraglia, who also took part in the study at Oxford University, added: 'Our research provides a clear timeline showing the deep level of interaction that early humans had with the rainforest in South Asia. 'We need further research to see if this pattern was also followed in other similar environments in Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Australasia and Africa.' This tooth, also found at the\u00a0Batadombealena cave in Sri Lanka may be even older than the ones in the study. Analysis of teeth found at\u00a0Batadombalena in Sri Lanka show the people that lived her survived in the rainforest."}

City are borderline whether they are placed in either the second or third group of seeds for the 2015-16 group stages and risk a potential draw with Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, or Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid, if they don't improve their UEFA coefficient and drop into pot three. Pellegrini's men - who lost 1-0 in the Nou Camp on Wednesday and 3-1 overall on aggregate - are currently ranked the 16th best team in Europe but that could fall after they failed to make this season's quarter-finals. A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona edged out City with a 1-0 win in the Nou Camp to end their Euro dream. Manchester City could drop down into pot three after crashing out of the Champions League. Vincent Kompany and his Manchester City team-mates could not overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Atletico Madrid, Benfica, Schalke, Arsenal, Porto, Manchester United, Paris St Germain, Borussia Dortmund, Valencia, Zenit St Petersburg, Bayer Leverkusen and Manchester City. *Liverpool are only ranked 40th so are guaranteed a tough draw if they finish in the top four. Coefficients are based on European performances over the last five seasons which is why Manchester United are placed higher than City despite not qualifying last season. Arsenal's ranking also remains high because they have reached the Champions League knockout stages every year in the time span. City have complained in the past of unfavourable draws in the Champions League group stages hampering their progress. Despite more than \u00a31billion invested into the club since 2008, the Abu Dhabi owners have not seen their side progress beyond the first knockout stage of the competition. They failed to qualify from a tough group in 2011-12 after being paired with Napoli, Bayern Munich and Villarreal and suffered the same fate the following season against Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax. Their co-efficient has risen since and they were able to finish second in their group this season after being placed among the second seeds and being drawn against Bayern Munich, CSKA Moscow and Roma. However, UEFA have changed their seeding policy for next season and the domestic champions of England, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Russia will automatically be top seeds alongside the winners of this year's competition. Man United will be placed in pot two if they finish inside the top four despite last season's poor campaign. Chelsea are ranked the fourth best side in Europe - behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The second pot will be made up of the next eight highest-ranked clubs \u2013 and City can't be certain of that. Among the clubs just below them in the listings are Juventus who look certain to be top seeds as Italian champions and Sevilla, Inter Milan and Napoli who are all still in the Europa League and can improve their coefficient in that competition. There are still a lot of twists and turns in the domestic leagues before next season's seedings are announced and of course City still have to confirm their own participation by finishing in the top four of the Premier League. But there is no doubt the outcome in the Nou Camp, where they have to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit, could have an effect on City. This is how next season's Champions League group seedings would look if the season ended during the current stage of the campaign:. Top seeds: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Lyon, Benfica, Zenit St Petersburg and Juventus. Second pot: Atletico Madrid (ranked 5th), Arsenal (8th), Porto (9th), Manchester United (10th), Paris St Germain (11th), Valencia (13th), Bayer Leverkusen (15th) and Manchester City (16th) City are particularly vulnerable because they could be replaced by Schalke in the second pot if the German side, currently fifth in the Bundesliga, finished in the top four. Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool are likely to face a tough Champions League draw if they seal a top-four spot."}

After discussing the situation with the school district, it was decided that Swager should adopt her new identity immediately. Swager considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to\u00a0notify only students in her class and their parents, rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone. 'We decided as a district, as a faculty, that it would do more harm than good to do a mass notification,' Swager told NBC4. 'Instead do individual notifications in classrooms where they knew what to expect.' The district's handling of the matter and Swager sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it.

The 55-year-old woman tried to hold back tears as she spoke Tuesday of being held against her will by her ex-husband, Garrett Cunningham, 64, also a Broward court deputy, though he is currently suspended. The Sun Sentinel reports that the couple met in 1983 while working as corrections officers in New York City's Riker's Island. Alleged assault: Garrett Cunningham, 64, who worked as a court bailiff was accused by his ex-wife of handcuffing and shackling her before sexually assaulting her in 2013. They married in 1990, but the woman described how Cunningham's gambling habits drove them into debt, costing them their house and his car. The woman said she tried to keep the couple afloat - even covering a $2,000 debt Cunningham owed - and stated that even after they separated, she would drive him to work. In September 2013, she drove him to the Plantation motel on State Road 7 where he had been living and asked her to help carry groceries to his room, she said. She testified that once inside the room, Cunningham handcuffed her and shackled her legs, before pulling out a Glock pistol from under the mattress and pointing it at her. On the wall was a note listing everything Cunningham had done wrong in his life, while a second note on the bed had a list of questions about her personal and dating life, according to an arrest affidavit. What followed was an hours-long interrogation, where Cunningham berated his wife over who she was dating, she testified. County court: Cunningham and his ex-wife met as corrections officers at Riker's Island in New York City and began working as bailiffs in 1999. Cunningham demanded her phone and the password to unlock it. After reading texts sent between her and a man she had met online, he threw the phone to the floor and shot its screen, she said. 'He had this crazed look in his eye,' she claimed on the stand. 'I just knew in that moment that I was not coming out of that hotel room alive.' She said that after several hours Cunningham concluded she had to be punished, and used a vegetable to sodomize her. When she cried out, he pointed the gun at her head and told her that he would shoot her if she couldn't stop screaming, she said. She testified that she cried as she held back screams as he continued his alleged assault. Cunningham was arrested days later. In December, he was suspended without pay by the Broward Sheriff's Office. He is currently being tried on two counts of sexual battery, one count of false and one count of. His wife left the motel after allegedly being attacked, then showered and fell asleep, according to Cunningham's attorney, who seized on her delay in reporting the assault. Defense attorney Gabriel Ermine said the woman fabricated the story of assault in hopes of keeping an inheritance she had recently received from her late parents. 'She wanted it all to herself,' Ermine said in an opening statement. 'Now she's using you to convict him so he doesn't get any money.' The woman called police after the assault and attempted to get Cunningham committed under Florida's Baker Act, which allows for the involuntary examination of a person that poses threat of harm to self or others. She reported the alleged assault two days later,  explaining to the jury that she had a difficult time coming to terms with what had happened at the hands of her husband. 'You did that to me!' she yelled at Cunningham in court. 'I didn't do that to you. I cared for you.'"}

The poster featuring blonde model Fiona Butler, who was 18 at the time the image was taken, attracted a flurry of criticism when the official Wimbledon Twitter account included it in a post promoting the Powerful Posters exhibition. Some followers accused the home of Wimbledon of sexism for highlighting the image, taken by\u00a0the late Martin Elliott in 1976 at the University of Birmingham's tennis courts and printed by Athena. 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it,' the profile later said after removing the post. Athena's Tennis Girl poster caused a Twitter stir and Wimbledon was forced to apologise after using it to promote a forthcoming exhibition called Powerful Posters. Last year the dress worn by Butler in the famous image, the wooden tennis racquet she is holding, a a 1979 edition poster and a 1980s limited edition canvas print were sold at auction for \u00a315,500. While such a price may indicate its historic value and iconic status, many on Twitter felt it had no place as a promotional tool for the exhibit in which it features at the respected venue. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma expressed her outrage on Twitter, saying: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who go by the name 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster, which will be exhibited with the handmade dress worn by model Fiona Butler and wooden racquet used in the 1976 shoot, to promote the exhibition. Even the wording of the apology attracted criticism as a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Twitter user David B backed the club, saying: 'Presumably John McEnroe will now have to be airbrushed out of Wimbledon history? These PC idiots - \"They cannot be serious!\"' An All England Club spokesman has since confirmed the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis.

'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Roger Federer's fan group said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for \u2013 I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.' The year-long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum's collection, an 1893 advertisement for The Championships, through to the original artwork for this year's Grand Slam at the world famous venue in London SW19."}

Hidden cameras captured a pod of dolphins in action as they got 'high' from nerve toxins released by a pufferfish in waters off Southeast Africa. Floating off: In the incredible scene, filmed for a Discovery Channel special, the sea creatures are seen rolling on their backs with their eyes closed in an apparent state of bliss. In a trance: At one point the dolphins are seen floating just underneath the water's surface, apparently mesmerized by their own reflections. Though large doses of a puffer's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect. To release the substance, the bottlenose dolphins were caught chasing the pufferfish along the ocean floor. In a bid to escape attack, footage shows the fish quickly inflating into a ball shape. The playful dolphins then grab the puffer between their teeth and pass it around until it eventually lets out a burst of poison. A brown-colored cloud is seen dispersing and diluting in the water. As the dolphins drift off into their own world, the weary pufferfish seizes the chance to deflate and slip away into the deep blue. Getting in on the act: Though large doses of a puffer's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect. The footage, from Dolphins: Spy in the Pod, was taken by wildlife filmmaker John Downer - who has previously used hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens. Downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid, tuna and even other dolphins. Zoologist and series producer Rob Pilley said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way. He added: 'We saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves, very gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset the fish too much or kill it. 'As a result the fish released various toxins as a defense. The dolphins then seemed to be mesmerized.' He insisted that the scene couldn't have been a one-off encounter, saying: 'The dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately handling them with care.' The series, which aired on the Discovery Channel on Saturday, follows the success of Penguins: Spy In the Huddle, which used similar tactics of disguised cameras, documentary producer Downer was eager to create a range of cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented proximity to their favorite species.

Covert: The footage, from Dolphins: Spy in the Pod, was taken by wildlife filmmaker John Downer \u2013 who has previously used hidden cameras (seen above) to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens. As well as the Dolphincam, the Tunacam, Turtlecam and Squidcam have also been created for different spying roles, with each fitted with HD cameras to capture life under the sea. With the help of the cameras, viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the center of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once. Some 900 hours of raw footage was collected over a 12-month period from locations including America, Coasta Rica, South Africa, Argentina and Australia. The pufferfish footage was filmed in waters near Mozambique. The film crew also dived some 1,500 times, spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the Spy Creatures in all types of weather. Speaking of the project, Downer said: 'Unlike Penguin-cams, this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast-moving dolphins, often out in the deep ocean. 'The dolphins were very curious about their new neighbors and allowed them into their lives.' Downer's last project, Spy in the Huddle, took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year."}

And the number of sufferers is set to soar by 55 per cent in the next two decades unless the human population drastically changes the way it eats and exercises. The study by researchers at the University of East Anglia estimates that 382million people had diabetes in 2013. At current rates, that figure is expected to reach 592million by 2035. Around 10 per cent of sufferers have type 1 diabetes \u2013 an auto-immune disorder that is usually present from childhood. But the other 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes \u2013 an illness driven by a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. The chronic illness is a particular problem in fast-developing countries. In China and India, almost 10 per cent of adults have diabetes, compared with the global average of 8.3 per cent, reveals the study published in the journal Pharmaco Economics. In Britain, around 3.2million people have diabetes. Lead researcher Till Seuring said: \u2018Diabetes has become an epidemic. \u2018The rising prevalence of diabetes in these countries has been fuelled by rapid urbanization, changing eating habits, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. \u2018Diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to grow to 592 million by 2035. \u2018It is a chronic disease that has spread widely in recent decades - not only in high-income countries, but also in many populous low and middle-income countries such as India and China.\u2019 He added: \u2018We would hope that the findings further increase the policy attention being paid to diabetes prevention and management in rich countries and it should in particular make health and economic policymakers in developing countries aware of the economic damage that diabetes can do.\u2019 The study, published in the journal Pharmaco Economics, cited data from the International Diabetes Federation estimating that 8.3 per cent of adults aged 20 to 79 now suffer from diabetes. In China and India the number is closer to 10 per cent, with 165million diabetics living in those two nations alone. Mr Seuring and his colleagues analysed the impact on increasing number of diabetics on the economies of 20 countries. They found that increased healthcare costs and reduced workforce productivity could severely dent economic growth. A woman adjust a device which delivers insulin to her body. In Britain 3.2 million people suffer from diabetes. And Mr Seuring warned of a hidden cost of carers, many of whom leave their jobs to care for loved ones. In Britain, where 3.2million people suffer with diabetes, Mr Seuring estimated the cost to be significant. He said: \u2018People in the UK with diabetes experience an income loss of \u00a3887 per year. But it is carers in the UK who are the worst hit financially, with a reduction in income of \u00a31327 annually.\u2019 That pales in comparison, however, with the US where the annual diabetes healthcare cost is $6,800 (\u00a34,600) \u2013 and the total economic burden per person reaches $283,000 (\u00a3191,200) over a lifetime."}

Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women as an expert claims the notorious predator gained pleasure from inflicting pain. The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation. Ms Meagher's father George McKeon (right) with\u00a0on Jill's wedding day with her cousin Louise McKeon (left) said\u00a0the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. Ms Meagher's murder triggered a parole system review by retired High Court judge Ian Callinan, who released his findings in July 2013. Bayley was released from prison on parole in 2010, but that should have been cancelled after he was convicted of assaulting a man in February 2012. Instead he appealed the assault charge and was released on bail, leaving him free to rape the 25-year-old, the backpacker and kill Ms Meagher. Ms Meagher's father George McKeon said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was clear from the Callinan report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. 'As a family, we have until now been very mindful not to make any statement or take any actions that might delay the outstanding criminal proceedings against Gillian's murderer,' McKeon said in a statement. 'However now that these proceedings are completed, we want to try and obtain closure and to ensure that other families don't have to endure this trauma.' 'In particular as a family we would like to:. 'A - Continue to raise awareness of the systemic problem of violence against women, an issue we as a family and Tom Meagher, in particular, is very closely associated with in both his writings and his role as an ambassador for the White Ribbon Campaign. 'B - Ensure that the proposed Coronial Inquest into the circumstances of Gillian's death does not proceed. Following the Callinan Report, the 20 May 2013 amendments to The Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) and the criminal proceeding in relation to her murder, we see little to be learned or gained from an open Inquest into her death.' The coroner removing Ms Meagher's body found on Black Hill Road in Gisborne South, north of Melbourne, Ausatralia, September 28 2012. To add to his string of offences, Bayley has been convicted of\u00a0raping an 18-year-old sex worker in his car in St Kilda in 2000 and a 25-year-old sex worker in April 2012 in eerily near identical circumstances. The 43-year-old also raped a Dutch backpacker in July 2012, just two months before his fatal attack on Ms Meagher, after telling her she was in danger and convincing her to climb into his car for safety. Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape. He contested each charge but juries found him guilty in three separate Victorian County Court trials. Suppression orders prohibited media outlets from publishing any details from the rape cases until the third guilty verdict was handed down on Thursday. His defence team argued that the three sexual assault victims had mistaken their attackers for Bayley because he featured heavily in the media spotlight with Ms Meagher's case. Bayley has now been found guilty of raping 10 women and attempting to rape two more. He is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Bayley was found guilty of raping the 18-year-old in July 2014, but suppression orders prevented reporting of the case until he faced the two other trials this month. Judge Sue Pullen lifted the orders when the final jury returned its verdict on the backpacker's case on Wednesday and will sentence Bayley at a later date."}

Philippe Coutinho (left) is hoping to hold down a regular place in the Brazil squad. The Liverpool midfielder was omitted from the 23-man World Cup squad last summer. The 22-year-old has appeared from the bench four times in the seven games since, but was an unused substitute as Brazil beat France 3-1 in Paris on Thursday night. 'Whenever I'm called up, it's like the first time,' Coutinho told an LFCTV documentary. 'It's a great honour to wear the Brazilian shirt, which thousands of people dream of wearing one day. I want to honour it whenever I have the opportunity. It means a lot to me. 'I believe being in the team is a dream for every player. You can represent your country.

A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary. Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder \u00a34,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period. The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard. Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.' He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money. 'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.' Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care. 'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did. 'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.' Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks \u00a310 every time she visited. The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year. Hearing: Croydon Crown Court (above) heard Marks even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital. 'She noticed there was \u00a32,000, or \u00a33,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said. Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of \u00a3100 and \u00a3200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added. She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing \u00a3100 from the victim's account the previous day. Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing. Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail sentence, but added: 'It's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly. 'Part of that is due to her age, but every time I see her she mentions it and says, \"Why did she take it?\" and \"How could she do that?\" 'When I told her about the sentence it was the first time I have seen her smile for a long time.' Mrs Baldwin said she was 'disgusted' by Marks, whom her family had known for around five years, saying: 'If she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow. 'I think she has gotten away with it up until now, but we weren't going to let her get away with it.'"}

{"abstract": "The Ig Nobel Prize is a satirical award that celebrates research that makes people laugh and think. It was founded 25 years ago by Marc Abrahams and is held at Harvard University. Previous winners include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and the Italian National Institute of Statistics for bringing the country out of recession through the use of prostitutes, drugs and smuggling.", "article": "(CNN)At first Raymond Goldstein thought he'd received a spam email. The message to the Cambridge University physicist was asking for help working out the dynamics of hair, specifically the shape of ponytails. Goldstein thought he'd \"won the Nigerian lottery.\" Poised to click delete, he scrolled through the message one more time and discovered it was from global consumer goods giant Unilever. Curiosity piqued, he met with a company representative, and the rest, as they say, is history. Assembling a team of balding physicists, Goldstein set out to tackle the subject, publishing their research in a peer review journal. It detailed the fluid mechanics of hair, drawing on a rich seam of scientific observation stretching back to Da Vinci. They even coined a new term: hairodynamics. Attention from the scientific community soon followed, and within a year they were collecting a Nobel Prize. An Ig Nobel Prize, that is. A satirical cousin to the more esteemed Swedish award, the Ig Nobel seeks to highlight research that first makes you laugh, then makes you think. This year marks their 25th anniversary, so what better time to celebrate the Ig Nobels' contribution to the research community? Every year thousands vie for the awards -- \"always sourced from the cheapest materials\" according to founder Marc Abrahams -- held at Harvard University. The ceremony is bathos at its finest. Winners receive their awards from genuine Nobel laureates, but speeches are curtailed by a screaming girl declaring her boredom. Each year a cast of professional singers and scientists perform a mini-opera. Last year's was set to Mozart and featured a chorus of microbial bacteria. Past recipients include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and a study of homosexual necrophilia among mallard ducks (commended by Abrahams for \"its high literary quality\"). However, not all winners can have such high scientific kudos. The Ig Nobels skewered the U.S. Government in 2012, awarding them the Prize for Literature \"for issuing a report about reports about reports that recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports about reports.\" You can read it here. In 2009 the Math Prize went to Gideon Gono, then head of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, for printing a Z$100 trillion note (while also printing 1c). Last year the Italian National Institute of Statistics landed the Economics Prize for bringing the country out of recession through the use of prostitutes, drugs and smuggling. (The Italian government ended up setting a precedent in Europe, with the UK soon including the so-called \"black economy\" in its figures -- national GDP jumped by 5% that quarter, equivalent to $15 billion.) As proved by the Ig Nobels, the line between ridiculous and serious research has always been blurred. This is no better reflected than in Dutch-British physicist Andre Geim. In 2000 Geim scooped the Ig Nobel for Biology for using magnets to levitate frogs. Ten years later he went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\" It is hard to say which is the greater achievement. Abrahams is currently touring the UK touting the Igs, supported by previous winners such as Goldstein and potential candidates like David Dunstan, who found fame by conducting a two year study into the homing properties of garden snails (his modus operandi: throwing them over the garden fence). Soon Abrahams will have to settle down and sift through what he predicts will be about 9,000 entries, before the anniversary ceremony on September 17. Despite his longstanding and much admired pastiche of the Nobels, he is still yet to be invited to Stockholm for the awards proper. Asked if he would attend if offered the opportunity, Abrahams demurs, saying \"he wouldn't want to be a distraction.\" And as for what the Nobel Prize could learn from his own mischievous creation? \"Absolutely nothing.\" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate:.

The solution combines Chlorin e6, insulin and saline, and was tested on one volunteer who was able to see in almost total darkness for several hours.

The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina. The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called \u2018biohackers\u2019 in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that \u2018the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.\u2019 As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye\u2019s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of \"night vision eye drops\" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called \u2018biohackers\u2019 in California called Science for the Masses. It is not advisable to try this at home. They used a solution containing Chlorin e6 (Ce6), found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also used in cancer treatment research. In the team's experiment, the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of Gabriel Licina, one of the researchers, which carried the solution to his retinas. \u2018Ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50\u03bcl [microlitres] into each eye,\u2019 the researchers wrote. The solution  initially made his eyes turn black, before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour. 'To me, it was a quick, greenish-black blur across my vision, and then it dissolved into my eyes,' Mr Licina told Mic. However, to \u2018reduce the potential for bright light exposure,\u2019 the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses. Within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low-light conditions. To test the effects, Mr Licina and four \u2018control\u2019 subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a \u2018darkened area\u2019. Within an hour, Mr Licina was able to see in darkness - for several hours. In experiments he could see three times better than 'normal' eyes. After testing, Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning seemed to return to normal. Shown is a stock image of US soldiers in Iraq in 2003.

Leigh was indicted earlier this month by a Suffolk County. grand jury on five larceny counts and a charge of making a false. claim to the government, the police department said. Charged: Investigators said Joanna Leigh, 41, was at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 when two bombs exploded,, but they have argued that she was not injured. It said Leigh received $8,000 from The One Fund Boston,. which raised nearly $80 million in the aftermath of the attack.

The news comes as the trial of accused bomber, 21-year-old. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev takes place in Boston. Tsarnaev could be. sentenced to death if he is convicted. Police said Leigh did not seek medical treatment for about. two weeks after the bombing, and when she did, she called. herself a 'hero' who ran toward the second explosion. 'At a time when most people were asking how they could help,. others were wondering how they could benefit,' Suffolk County. District Attorney Daniel Conley was quoted as saying in the. police statement. Leigh claims the charges are punishment for criticism of The One Fund Boston over its compensation policies. Leigh, who is set to be arraigned on Monday, told the Boston.

On a night when John Greig, Walter Smith and John Brown returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team couldn\u2019t match the renewed sense of optimism around Ibrox. Dropping another two points not only means Hearts can win the Championship title before the month is out, it also keeps Rangers in third place behind Hibs - with last night\u2019s visitors only six points adrift. Kenny McDowall issues instructions to his layers during the 1-1 draw with Queen of the South. McDowall says his side must be wary of Queen of the South in fourth and Falkirk in fifth. Asked if he thought that either the Dumfries side or Falkirk could pip his team to the final play-off spot, McDowall said: \u2018There is every chance. They are playing for the play-offs as much as we are. So we can\u2019t be disrespectful of them. \u2018Queen of the South are a good side, as are Falkirk. They are looking to win games like we\u2019re looking to win games. We\u2019ve got to work harder to turn it about. \u2018I think it\u2019s going to go right to the wire, the play-off places, without a shadow of a doubt. We have to find a formula to get winning again, We are stuttering along. \u2018We\u2019re not doing enough in front of goal and obviously not doing well enough to defend our goal. It\u2019s nothing other than hard work until we get back to winning games.\u2019 McDowall, who has won only three of his 10 games in charge since stepping in for Ally McCoist, said he hadn\u2019t yet been told if the new board had accepted the resignation he handed to the previous regime. Rangers midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, celebrates putting the home side ahead at Ibrox. Young Queen of the South striker Aidan Smith (centre) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller. \u2018No - I would expect them to come to me, as opposed me going to them,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve got games to concentrate on with the team, I\u2019m here to do that. I\u2019m sure if the board want to keep me they\u2019ll come and speak to me.\u2019 A cool Haris Vuckic finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give Rangers an ill-deserved three points from a bitty performance. But Queens equalised three minutes from time, 17-year-old sub Aidan Smith on the spot \u2013 and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a Michael Paton shot following a defensive mistake by home sub Bilel Moshni. The home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest Ibrox crowd of the season. McDowall said: \u2018It\u2019s very disappointing, when supporters had come out, the new board is in place and the stadium is full. You get the lead and you are hoping to see it out \u2013 and don\u2019t do it through poor, poor defending.\u2019 Rangers legend John Greig was in the stands at Ibrox for Tuesday night's Scottish Championship clash. Vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute Bilel Mohsni (left), Nicky Clark and Darren McGregor. Queens moved a point clear in the fourth and final play-off spot, although boss James Fowler believed his team could have won, declaring: \u2018It would have been a travesty had we not got anything out of it. We were the better team and had the better chances. \u2018But the boys reacted well after going behind and we are delighted young Aidan got the goal. \u2018Rangers came out fast but we then controlled the game and some of our passing was excellent. We are happy with the point but, being greedy, I\u2019d have liked the three. It\u2019s still going to be difficult to make the play-offs. There are a few clubs in there but we will keep going.\u2019 Goalscorer Smith, making just his second appearance for the club, said: \u2018It\u2019s the best feeling ever. The ball just fell at my feet and I managed to lift it over the keeper. I actually thought Michael Paton was going to score before I did.

The bequests in these bizarre wills also include one from a father who wanted his step-daughter to receive the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother did not pay her for them. The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - based in Farringdon, central London - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills. Unusual: The strange wills include the 1888 document by boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. 'Rotten old pig: Mr Orton, who only left one farthing to his wife, was born in 1818 and died in 1888, aged 70.

Writing's on the will: Isaac Cooke from Surrey, who died in 1936, left everything to his wife, Alice. He wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem. One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose' During that time the experts have dug up scores of unusual passages written on the legal declarations - before whittling these down to a top ten, which have now been revealed. Their discoveries include the 1888 will of boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence. They also found a 'beautifully written' seven-versed poem and a will revealing how a man left money to Christ, as long as He could prove His identity. In another will, 59-year-old Annie Langabeer wanted to give her brother-in-law two shillings and sixpence so he could 'buy a rope' because she wanted him to hang himself. Employees at the firm have looked through a staggering 200,000 wills since the late 1960s trying to trace people's family trees. They found one written in 2002 by Stephen Cuthbert, from Wiltshire, which included strict instructions that his estate paid for the 'p*** up' after his funeral. Money: The will of Kenneth Gibson, born in 1923 in Lincolnshire, who requested in 1999 that his step-daughter should get the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages that she claimed in my presence that her late mother Ann Cox had not paid her for' Wide-ranging: Sir Charles Stewart Henry Vane Tempest Stewart, the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, wrote his 55-page will in 1945. He was one of the richest men in the country at the time and had everything covered. He not only wanted his wife to have all of his animals, but also 'the natural increase of animals' too. Romantic: Richard Walker wrote his will in 1981 and decided to leave the majority of his wealth, \u00a310,000, to the 'love of his life', Miss Miss Gay Varasporn Suwanahong - who he met in a bar in Thailand.

Gerrard began the game for Liverpool, while James Wilson, born in Staffordshire 27.5 miles away from Old Trafford, was selected by Louis van Gaal. Like Gerrard, there is also a possibility that Wilson and Tyler Blackett - also born in Manchester - could feature on Sunday. Jon Flanagan, meanwhile, will return at some stage from injury to boost the Reds' Scouse contingent. But with the departure of Welbeck from United last summer, and Gerrard leaving Liverpool at the end of the season, the chances are that the trend of no local lads starting the biggest game in English football will continue for a little while longer."}

Norman Lee, who worked on Avengers and X-Men, were about 250 yards off the coast of Grand Cayman on Thursday afternoon when he became separated from wife of fives years, Jan. Despite round-the-clock helicopter, diving and boat searches, investigators have found no sign of the 47-year-old from Weymouth, Massachusetts. Tragic: The search for Norman Lee, an inker for Marvel/DC Comics, in the Cayman Islands has been called off. Went missing: He was snorkeling with his wife Jan on Thursday when they became separated. On Saturday evening, the search was called off after chief inspector Brad Ebanks said the currents are so strong it is 'unlikely that we will make any recovery at this stage.' Lee started working for Marvel and DC Comics in 1995 as an 'inker', drawing over pencil sketches in pen before the comic goes to print. He is scheduled to appear at Boston Comic Con this summer. Long career: Lee, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, worked on Avengers and X-Men during his career. He was a permanent fixture at Comic Con events and is scheduled to appear at Boston's this July. Tributes have flooded in on Lee's Facebook page.

The company said Monday that it's recalling 3 oz. institutional/food service cups of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test detected listeria in one of the cups recovered from a Kansas hospital. There have been no illnesses reported from the cups, Blue Bell said. The contaminated cup was produced at a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in April 2014, the company said. Earlier this month the company recalled a group of products that were made at a plant in Texas as Kansas health officials said three people had died in the past year from a listeria outbreak that could be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products. A total of five people have contracted the serious infection in Kansas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had eaten milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" Listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the CDC. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year; approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth. The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This is the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said.

This stunning weather map shows\u00a0how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest February's on record, while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. The extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. The satellite image produced by NASA records the land surface temperature. The places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue, normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average. The map has been produced using data from NASA's Terra satellite and shows how temperatures this February compared with those over the last ten years.. The satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map  shows a clear divide  right down the middle of the country. The areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue, normal appear white, and those in red were warmer than average. The mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average. Statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in February, but many cities broke their own records, according to Live Science. In New York a new low of minus 13 degrees was set, beating its old record by 1.6 degrees. Last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of New York's Hudson River forcing the US Coastguard to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving. Ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years. A huge ice volcano also appeared in a New York Park. Records were also broken in the likes of Worcester and\u00a0Massachusetts. In contrast record highs were set in the likes of Washington, Nevada, and California during February, according to the website. California is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall. This has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years, according to a study. Experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir - for California to recover.

Researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the US last. NASA's Earth Observatory said: 'Most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a\u00a0persistent ridge\u00a0of high pressure\u2014nicknamed\u00a0the \u201cRidiculously Resilient Ridge\u201d\u2014over the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the Arctic into central North America. 'But why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern Pacific during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts. 'A new line of research suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier, thus setting up the unusual pattern over North America. 'Other researchers think there could be a link between Siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes. 'Still others think changes in the Arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western Pacific as the key factor. All participants looking at the question agree: more research is needed.'"}

Italy's medical staff announced that Serie A leaders Juventus's Marchisio suffered ruptured knee ligaments during the warm-up for Friday's training session ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria on Saturday. 'I saw him (Conte) shaken this morning,' Italian football federation (FIGC) president Carlo Tavecchio told Radio Rai on Saturday. 'After yesterday's controversy, he received death threats on the internet. Italy boss Antonio Conte is'shaken' after receiving online death threats from Juventus fans. The Italy national team manager has been criticised for pushing his players too hard in training. 'I met with Conte for a long time and he is not calm. All these things have been said on social networks and he feels vilified for something that is not his fault. The FIGC stands by him.' Conte was criticised by John Elkann, the president of the holding company which controls FIAT and Juventus, who said the Italy coach worked the players too hard during the national team's training camps. 'Perhaps he'd like to be remembered as the cherry-picker with the highest number of injuries,' Elkan told Italian media. Former Juventus coach Conte defended his methods. 'I wonder why Elkann didn't ask me that when I was at Juventus? We don't work hard, we work well,' the 45-year-old told a news conference in Sofia ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Italian media reported that Conte was reconsidering his position as Italy coach after the death threats. The Italian FA was not immediately available to comment. Juve midfielder Claudio Marchisio injured ankle ligaments, but will return sooner than first expected. Juventus, however, said Marchisio could be back in action within days. 'After returning from international duty on Friday afternoon, Claudio Marchisio underwent medical examinations conducted by Juventus club doctors and Dr Flavio Quaglia,' the club said in a statement. 'The 29-year-old then underwent an MRI scan on his right knee this evening. The tests ruled positive, excluding the possibility of a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament. Marchisio will now rest, and his condition is to be monitored on a day-to-day basis.' Conte returned Juventus to their former glory before leaving to take charge of the Azzurri. Marchisio underwent his first examination at the Istituto Fanfani in Florence, close to Italy's training ground. 'I spoke to my colleagues in Turin, explained what happened and organised to send the lad straight to the club for further tests,' Italy doctor Enrico Castellaci said. 'Juve gave me the all-clear to make the diagnosis public. That night, I contacted the Juve medics again. Now there are two contrasting test results. Naturally, I'd be very happy if the later test was confirmed. These are the facts.' Castellaci's explanation prompted jokes on social media with Italian media and fans labelling the national team's medical staff as a 'laughing stock'. Italy have won three matches and drawn one to sit second on 10 points in Group H, behind Croatia on goal difference. Bulgaria are fourth with four points."}

The documentary has been met with both admiration and criticism, with some seeing it as a government PR move and others praising Chai for her courage to address the sensitive topic.", "article": "Beijing (CNN)If you live in China and haven't watched -- or at least heard about -- \"Under the Dome,\" you must have been living under a rock. The almost two-hour documentary on air pollution in China produced by a famous TV journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release Saturday, clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across Chinese cyberspace. The air pollution that's choking Asia. Here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context:. The slickly produced video shows journalist Chai Jing presenting a comprehensive slide show, intercutting with fast-paced footage of her travels across China and the rest of world, to find answers to three questions: What is smog, where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it? As shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of China regularly, the video has struck such a chord with the audience that, in two short days, it's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world's most populous nation. Many Internet users have compared it to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" the Oscar-winning documentary on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. Chai, 39, was already a household name before last weekend thanks to her career at China Central Television, the state-run national broadcaster. As a long-time CCTV anchor and investigative reporter, Chai stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines. Her choice of stories and style of reporting -- calm but tenacious -- have earned her legions of fans nationwide -- with some nicknaming her \"the Goddess\" for her elegance and intelligence on air. Plenty of detractors, however, consider her a leading elitist voice for the country's liberal intellectuals. After writing a best-selling autobiography chronicling her time at CCTV, Chai quit her job last year to take care of her daughter, who had been born with a tumor. Declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother, Chai tries to dig deep in her self-funded documentary. With her former CCTV connections opening doors, she followed and interviewed top environmental and energy officials and experts in China -- and received surprisingly candid responses. While there is no obvious hero in the video, the villain seems to be clear. A former chief engineer of the state-owned oil conglomerate Sinopec brushes off Chai's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible. Tracing the main source of tiny and dangerous pollutants in China to extremely inefficient energy exploration and use, Chai sees the solution in dismantling entrenched interests of the state energy sector -- and also appeals to the public for less reliance on cars and more proactive reporting of polluters. Admiration from celebrity and ordinary viewers -- many said to be moved to tears -- poured in almost immediately. In countless reposts of the video links, people praise Chai for her courage to address the sensitive topic head on and spread the knowledge to the masses. One text message of gratitude to Chai from the new minister of environmental protection -- who had been appointed only a day earlier -- has fueled suspicion among her critics that the video was nothing more than a government PR move. They point to the positive coverage of the video's massive online launch across state media, including an in-depth interview with Chai on the website of People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. Also, the timing: The video was released just days ahead of China's annual parliament session, during which legislators are expected to rubber-stamp the Communist leadership's policy agenda. President Xi Jinping had declared keeping the sky blue in the country as a top priority. Some argue that the energy industry makes a convenient political target, as Xi's ongoing anti-corruption campaign had netted a former senior leader whose power bases included the state oil sector. Others even see the video as propaganda to prepare people for mass layoffs in overbuilt and inefficient state industries as the government restructures the economy. Questions have also arisen on the science in the video -- including Chai's apparent linking smog to her baby daughter's tumor. And the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even China's seasoned censors off guard. Heated arguments have raged online, including blaming pollution on China's political system due to its lack of accountability. By late Sunday night, although the video remained online, all mention of it had been scrubbed from homepages of web portals and news sites. With discussions on the video shifting to social media, a common consensus seems to have emerged: Love it or hate it, Chai's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the U.S. embassy as recently as November. Some internet users have compared \"Under the Dome\" phenomena to the discussion over \"the dress"}

Despite her ordeal, she has shown a forgiving attitude and hopes Rimmer will turn his life around.", "article": "Sam Rimmer, 19, sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knife point and was jailed for 12 years. A teenager who sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knifepoint in a brutal attack which left her with 44 separate injuries has been jailed for 12 years. Sam Rimmer, 19, climbed in through the window of the frail victim's home before launching the 'vicious' sex attack. The drunken intruder was armed with a large bread knife when he broke into her house in Greater Manchester on November 8 last year. The terrified woman became aware of a'shadow in her room' moments before he sexually assaulted and tried to rape her, Manchester Crown Court was told. She fought back and grabbed the knife from the thug, dropping the weapon by the side of the bed. Rimmer, from Irlam, Greater Manchester, responded by punching the\u00a0arthritis sufferer on the shoulder and forcing his fist into her mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying attack. But as she prayed out loud he'suddenly came to his senses', apologised and fled before confessing to a friend. Prosecutor Phil Dobson told the court how the woman's mobility was badly affected by the attack. Because she now struggles to move her right arm, the pensioner has become reliant on her family and struggles to pay for carers to help with cooking, dressing and bathing. Despite sleepless nights, she has shown a'spirited determination and forgiving attitude' in the wake of her terrible ordeal, Mr Dobson said. In a witness impact statement, the elderly woman said she had forgiven Rimmer for the shocking attack. 'I feel comfortable in the home I have had for 55 years and I will not let anyone force me out of my own home,' she said. 'Unfortunately I don't think I will ever be able to forget this incident, due to the physical problems I have and the upset it has caused not only me, but my family. 'I really struggle to understand why he has done this to me, however I have no ill feelings towards him and forgive him for what he has done. 'I'm a strong Catholic and feel sorry for him and his family. I hope he will turn his life around.' Rimmer forced his hand into the frail woman's mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying sex attack, Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard. Hunter Gray, defending, argued that with no previous convictions, Rimmer should not be classed as a 'dangerous' offender. But judge Hilary Manley disagreed, saying that Rimmer attacked the victim with 'extreme force and viciousness'. She added: 'She tried to resist and fight you. You were a young man of 19, making yourself as fit as possible for entry into the Army. She was an 84-year-old who had to use sticks when she walked. 'She is clearly resilient and brave but these offences have had a profound impact on her life... she's not spent a night at home alone since this incident. This was a vicious and humiliating attack on a vulnerable and defenceless elderly woman, it must have been a terrifying experience for her. 'Had she not managed to disarm you it could have ended even more badly.' 'You cannot present a reason why you committed this offence - the lengthy and unnecessary violence causes the gravest concern.' Rimmer admitted attempted rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 12 years. He must spend an extra five years on licence and will not be released until the authorities are satisfied he is no longer dangerous."}

Smith's former players have all received a letter from Miller McNeish & Breedlove, PA, informing them that the great man had requested each of his former players be sent a $200 check to 'enjoy a dinner out compliments of Coach Dean Smith' Tributes for Coach Smith poured in from all over the sporting world in a series of messages on social media. Tar Heels senior Jackson Simmons wrote on Instagram that Smith's 'impact on the game is one that will stand the test of time.' Fellow UNC alum Harrison Barnes also honored the late coach by tweeting  thanks for all the things you stood for and believed in #CarolinaWay.' Born on February 28, 1931, in Emporia, Kansas, Dean Edwards Smith was the son of public school teachers. Players: Former UNC players Sam Perkins, far left, James Worthy, and Michael Jordan, second right, stand alongside former  coach Dean Smith. \u00a0Jordan described Smith as like 'a second father' He graduated from Topeka High School in 1949 and went to the University of Kansas on an academic scholarship, according to goheels.com. He played varsity basketball and baseball and freshman football for the Jayhawks. He was a member of Jayhawk basketball teams that won the NCAA title in 1952 and finished second in 1953. Smith also served in the US Air Force as a lieutenant and played and coached basketball in Germany. In 1958, Frank McGuire hired him as an assistant coach at North Carolina where he served as an assistant under McGuire for three years then Smith became Carolina's head coach. In recent years, Smith had been battling an illness that was causing him to lose his memory his family said in 2010. Medal: Larry Brown, right, presents Smith, with a medal during Smith's induction into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in Kansas City, Missouri, he has died aged 83. But Roy Williams, the current North Carolina coach who spent 10 years as Smith's assistant also paid tribute to him. He said: 'He was the greatest there ever was on the court, but far, far, better off the court with people.' 'I'd like to say on behalf of all our players and coaches, past and present, that Dean Smith was the perfect picture of what a college basketball coach should have been. We love him and we will miss him,' Williams added. Smith coached the Tar Heels from 1961-97.\u00a0He retired after winning the most in the sport with 879 victories. In 1982 and 1983 he won NCAA titles and coached such players as Michael Jordan and James Worthy. Tribute: Roy Williams, left, sits with Smith \u00a0in 1991, following his death, he paid tribute to him saying he 'was the greatest there ever was on the court, but far, far, better off the court with people' He reached 11 Final Fours, won 13 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament titles and coached the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal in 1976. During his career he had received many accolades and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1983. He is also a member of the the FIBA Hall of Fame, the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame and the College Basketball Hall of Fame. But over the past five years Smith had kept a low profile. In 2013, his wife, Linnea, accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom on his behalf from President Barack Obama."}
{"abstract": "Deco has selected his dream team of leading players to have graced the Champions League, featuring Manuel Neuer in goal, Carles Puyol, John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho in defence, Diego Simeone, Paul Scholes, Xavi and Zinedine Zidane in midfield, and Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Ronaldinho in attack. The Portuguese star praised the hard work of Ronaldo and the natural talent of Messi, as well as the leadership of Puyol and Terry. He also expressed his wish to have played with Zidane, who he believes is one of the best midfielders in the history of the game.", "article": "Deco is part of an elite group of players to have won the Champions League twice - with Jose Mourinho's Porto in 2004 and with Barcelona in 2006. The Portuguese also played in Europe's elite club competition with Chelsea, playing a total of 103 matches in Europe and scoring 19 goals. Looking back over his career, the playmaker here selects his dream team of leading players to have graced the Champions League. Deco scores for Porto against Monaco in the 2004 Champions League final in Gelsenkirchen. Deco (centre) then lifted the Champions League with Barcelona two years later. The Portuguese star celebrates with Didier Drogba during his time at Chelsea. Goalkeeper. Manuel Neuer. When I was playing in Europe he was not so well known, but he has turned into the best I have ever seen. His performances for both Germany and Bayern are exceptional. Manuel Neuer makes a penalty save from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2012 Champions League semi-final. Defenders. Carles Puyol. Was such a leader for Barcelona. That is not to take anything away from his ability as a defender, but he was as important in the dressing room as he was on the field. Barcelona legend Carles Puyol lifts the European Cup after their win over Man United in the 2009 final. John Terry. Very similar to how Puyol was for Barcelona, John was the leader of Chelsea and is still doing it now. When he does decide to retire, he will be so hard for Chelsea to replace. John Terry lifts the famous trophy after Chelsea's win over Bayern Munich in 2012. Ricardo Carvalho. One of my best moments is winning the Champions League with him, then it was great to play with him again all those years later at Chelsea. Without doubt he is the classiest defender I have ever played with. Ricardo Carvalho carries Pedro Mendes after Porto's triumph in the 2004 Champions League final. Midfield. Diego Simeone. Diego Simeone was a really tough competitor; he would always let you know he was there. He wasn\u2019t just tough though, he had a really excellent range of passing. Diego Simeone guided Atletico Madrid to the Champions League final last season. Paul Scholes. It is not coincidence so many professionals talk so highly of Paul Scholes. Of course he is one of the best midfield players of my Champions League, but also I think you can call him one of the best midfield players in the history of the game. Paul Scholes won the European Cup for the second time when Man United beat Chelsea in 2008. Xavi. At the peak of Barcelona he was at the centre of everything that was good about Barcelona. Maybe the other players got more headlines, but Xavi was the catalyst for it all. Xavi takes on Manchester United's Ryan Giggs during the 2011 final at Wembley. Zinedine Zidane. The one player of my generation I wish I could have played with. Just a fantastic player in every single way. Zinedine Zidane scores his famous volley as Real Madrid beat Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final. Attack. Lionel Messi. Messi is a natural born talent, that is not to say he doesn\u2019t work hard, but you can\u2019t teach what he can do him and Ronaldo are actually I think very different, but at the moment they are the two best in the world. Lionel Messi lifts the trophy for the third time after Barcelona's 2011 win over Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo. What a lot of people don\u2019t see is just how hard Ronaldo has worked to get where he is, he is the ultimate professional. Of course he has natural ability, but not many people know how hard he has worked to be voted the best player in the world. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring for Real Madrid in last season's Champions League final. Ronaldinho. I always remember when we (Barcelona) would go two or three goals up, and Ronny would start to enjoy himself. He done things that you just think are not possible with a football, he is the best I have ever played with. Ronaldinho celebrates scoring for Barcelona in a 2006 Champions League tie with Werder Bremen. Former Chelsea midfielder Deco has selected his Champions League XI."}

Well organised, disciplined, brave, resolute. The region may be famous for speculation and bold gambles, but Jose Mourinho would be proud of the side produced by his compatriot Leonardo Jardim. This was a pragmatic, impressive display against a team who knew they needed three goals and threw all they had at that task in the second half.

It was horribly tense for Monaco once Aaron Ramsey scored Arsenal\u2019s second with 11 minutes to go \u2014 but, once again, in this competition Arsene Wenger\u2019s team lost it in the first leg. That third away goal at the Emirates Stadium was the killer. It was the one Wenger\u2019s players could not match. Monaco knew they had done the hardest yards in London and ultimately settled for heroic defeat. It was like watching one of Nick Faldo\u2019s fourth-day specials. They played to par, laid up at the big one, didn\u2019t take the course on, and won. As Arsenal threw more at it with the minutes slipping away, Monaco pressed forward and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then. Instead, Arsenal were left with hope right until the end, a goal short of the last eight. It is the hope that does for you in the end, of course. It probably would have hurt less to have lost both legs. The goal that brought Arsenal to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in Champions League history came in the 79th minute after Theo Walcott hit a post with a side-footed shot. A rare moment of blind panic saw full back Layvin Kurzawa clear horribly straight to Ramsey. He took a touch and struck it low into the far corner. Cue pandemonium in the closing stages, not least when referee Svein Oddvar Moen, from Norway, signalled a generous period of five minutes additional time. Yet, really, Arsenal did little with it. They lumped it in, Monaco hoofed it out. Predictably, Monaco\u2019s hoofs were better than Arsenal\u2019s lumps. It really isn\u2019t their game. Nor is the high-tempo, high-energy, gung-ho rollercoaster that was Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s famous comeback against Inter Milan in the San Siro, a repeat of which may just have rattled the French side. Four goals and a goalkeeper down at half-time, Tottenham pulled it back to 4-3 and would surely have drawn level had they not run out of time. Giroud scored in the first half at the Stade Louis II to give Arsenal hope of pulling off a comeback in their last"}
{"abstract": "Islamic State has imposed a fee of 15,000 Syrian pounds for Caesarean operations, which is two months salary for the average Syrian worker. This is in opposition to Western trends in gynaecology and is seen as a plot against Muslim mothers. Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.", "article": "Islamic State is clamping down on Caesarean operations in the latest attack on what it perceives to be decadent Western practices. Doctors working for ISIS have been ordered to charge 15,000 Syrian pounds for a Caesarean childbirth operation, the equivalent of two months salary for the average Syrian worker. Under the harsh new rules enforced by the terror group, doctors who carry out the operations without charging the fee will now face unspecified punishments. The Islamic State order stipulates that the new charges are aimed at deterring hospitals from carrying out routine Caesareans. Jihadi brides like these, posing with a BMW in Syria, won't be allowed a Caesarean operation if they need one to give birth unless they can afford 15,000 Syrian pounds - two months salary for the average worker. A surgical team performing a Caesarean. Some clerics consider the procedure too Western and decadent. But the high fees will force women who can't afford the operations to endure painful childbirth. A written order published in the northern Syrian province of Deir az-Zor states: 'in order to assist the believers from the sons of Islam who are working in the medical corps to support their brothers from the poor and others besides them from the Muslim populace, and with the desire to keep the course of medical work removed from arbitrary whim.' It adds: 'This is to be considered as tantamount to a written order and all who contravene it will be held accountable in the Dar al-Qa\u1e0da [IS judiciary] with attendant consequence.' There is growing opposition among Islamic clerics to Western trends in gynaecology developments and in particular to mothers who wish to have a pain-free childbirth sometimes referred to as 'too posh to push'. One scholar has recently claimed that the rise in Caesarean operations in the Middle East is part of a plot against Muslim mothers. The wives of ISIS fighters like these will struggle to get pregnant again if they have a Caesarean, according to one cleric who calls the procedure a 'plot against Muslims' Sheikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen has ruled that Muslim mothers shouldn't need any decadent pain-relieving assistance in the delivery of their babies. In his ruling published on an Islamic website he says: 'I would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. 'I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant.' He adds: 'Some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a Caesarean, then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally.' ISIS is trying to build a modern health service, reportedly with help from these nine British medical students who have apparently travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Leaders of the Islamic State have tried to build a modern health service and have appealed to doctors from all over the world to travel to Syria and Iraq to join their medical teams. Earlier this year the Islamic State announced the opening of the Faculty of Medicine in Raqqa, in northern Syria, where doctors are trained in just three years. IS took control of Raqqa more than one year ago, to become one of the group's main strongholds in the region, imposing a so-called 'Islamic curriculum' on educational facilities in the city. Many Western jihadists have based themselves in this part of the region. Last week it was reported that nine British medical students travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Four women and five men entered the country, keeping their plans secret from relatives until shortly before they crossed the border from Turkey."}
{"abstract": "The article discusses the performance of various players in the Premier League, including Wayne Rooney, Peter Crouch, and Glenn Murray. Rooney has scored an average of 18.8 goals a season in his career, and Crouch has equalled Alan Shearer's record of 46 Premier League headers. Murray was key in Crystal Palace's promotion to the Premier League, and scored two top-class goals against West Ham.", "article": "WHAT MORE DOES WAYNE HAVE TO DO. When Louis van Gaal said he needed a 20-goal-a-season striker, I almost laughed. Manchester United have spent huge money and now he is saying Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie or Radamel Falcao can\u2019t score 20 goals? Do me a favour. Rooney issued the perfect response on Saturday. I still don\u2019t know why Van Gaal insists on playing him in midfield. In his career Rooney averages 18.8 goals a season. At United that figure is 20.6 goals. Still not good enough, Louis? Even if he only meant league goals, Rooney still ranks highly. Thierry Henry, one of the deadliest strikers in Premier League history and my Sky colleague at Wembley on Sunday, only scored 20 league goals in a season five times. Wayne has done it twice. His Premier League average is 14.1 a season but Alan Shearer, the league\u2019s leading goalscorer, averaged 18.6. Using Van Gaal\u2019s maths, even Shearer couldn\u2019t get into this United team\u2026. Louis van Gaal's suggestion that he needs a 20-goal-a-season striker is laughable - he has Wayne Rooney. Rooney scores for Manchester United against Sunderland in their 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday. THE BACK FOUR LOVE TO SCORE. It was not a vintage final, but Chelsea\u2019s back four held the key to victory at Wembley. Last time they played Tottenham they conceded five. On Sunday they didn\u2019t give them a sniff. Not only that but they were a threat at every set piece \u2014 Spurs looked fragile whenever John Terry and Co. went up. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify Jose Mourinho\u2019s style: win at all costs. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at Wembley. HAMMERS MUST AVOID FLAT FINISH. It was a surprise to see a Sam Allardyce team concede three set-piece goals. They are normally well organised, but I wonder if Big Sam\u2019s contract situation is affecting the players. It\u2019s the chairmen\u2019s prerogative not to talk deals until the summer, but if the players aren\u2019t sure the manager will be there, they might wonder why they should keep playing for him. Alex Song in particular was poor on Saturday and after a fine season for the club, it would be a pity if it tailed off. Sam Allardyce needs to turn West Ham's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season. Peter Crouch has\u00a0now scored 46\u00a0Premier League\u00a0headers, equalling\u00a0Alan Shearer\u2019s\u00a0record in the\u00a0competition. PETER PERFECT. When I played alongside Peter Crouch at Southampton, I was laughed at for saying he was good enough for England. Crouch has spent his career fighting people\u2019s perceptions, but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities. He scored a fantastic header against Hull but, even at 6ft 7in, heading may not even be the best part of his game. He\u2019s got a great touch, scored some fantastic goals \u2014 scissor kicks against Galatasaray, hat-tricks against Arsenal, volleys against Man City \u2014 and has enjoyed some memorable moments. Peter Crouch celebrates after scoring against Hull City during their Premier League clash. BRENDAN'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION. After that brilliant win over Man City, Liverpool are bang in the race for the top four. And here is a stat to prove it. In his three years in charge, Brendan Rodgers has lost just four league games after January 1. That is some record. Liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time. It helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to Champions League qualification this time round. They were excellent against City, with two world class goals, and they proved there is life after Steven Gerrard. With no Europa League football to distract them now, there\u2019s no doubt Liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch Manchester United and Arsenal. Liverpool's players celebrate during their 2-1 win against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday. MURRAY'S MOMENT. Glenn Murray was key in Crystal Palace\u2019s promotion to the Premier League but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013-14 with injury. He spent the first half of this season on loan but at Upton Park he looked every inch a top-flight striker. His movement was good, he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal, his second was top class. Yes, he tainted his day with a silly red card, but he looked like he was loving every minute. He deserves it. Glenn Murray rises above the West Ham defence to score"}

Ahead of the curtain raiser, Phil Duncan assesses the sport's hot topics... So, it looks like Lewis Hamilton is going to waltz to back-to-back titles\u2026. There\u2019s no question that Mercedes are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year. Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter, and they were the quickest, too. Hamilton won 11 of the 19 races last year, and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying, he\u2019ll be tough to beat. Lewis Hamilton appeared in a relaxed mood as he signed autographs for punters ahead of the season opener. Hamilton\u2019s popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter\u2026 Is there any danger he\u2019s taken his eye off the ball? The reigning champion has helped to raise F1\u2019s profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off-season. From the Paris catwalk to the red carpet at the BRITs, Hamilton's never been far from the limelight. His high-profile split from Nicole Scherzinger has hit the headlines, too. But the Briton, now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year, appears to have adopted a new-found maturity in recent times, and his desire to match Ayrton Senna\u2019s feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign. At least, he's telling us that anyway. Hamilton poses in his Mercedes overalls on Thursday as he prepares to defend his world championship. Rosberg, posing for pictures with fans on Thursday, will renew his title battle with team-mate Hamilton. So, what can Rosberg do to stop him? Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 12-7 last term, but his race displays left much to be desired; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014. If the German sorts out his race pace, he\u2019ll give Hamilton a run for his money. At 3-1 with some bookmakers, he\u2019s certainly worth a punt. And what about the rest of the grid? Williams, powered by Mercedes once more, are set to be Hamilton and Rosberg\u2019s nearest challengers. Valtteri Bottas was one of the stand-out performers last term, and his team-mate Felipe Massa is among the most experienced out there. Ferrari, boosted by the arrival of Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull, have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums. Daniel Ricciardo, the only non-Mercedes driver to win a race last year, should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014, but his Renault-powered Red Bull still lacks what it takes to challenge Hamilton and Rosberg on a consistent basis. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas was among the stand-out performers in 2014, and he is set to take the challenge to Mercedes once more. Daniel Ricciardo poses with models at the Albert Park Circuit ahead of his home race in Melbourne. I noticed you haven\u2019t mentioned McLaren\u2026 I thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with Honda? Well, that was the plan, but it looks as though it will be some time before either Fernando Alonso or Jenson Button get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race. The Woking-based outfit, struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace, too. Button, retained by McLaren after a surprise U-turn from the team's hierarchy at the end of last year, has already called for patience, and reckons just getting to the finish on Sunday, should be considered a positive result. Jenson Button is set for his 16th season in Formula One, but McLaren are likely to struggle from the offset. And Alonso, their marque signing, won't be there? No. The Spaniard suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days. CCTV captured the 134mph smash, but the footage \u00a0has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident. The former Ferrari man is confident he will back for the second race in Malaysia, but his participation is yet to be confirmed by McLaren.

{"abstract": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently re-introduced the Blackjack supersonic bomber, which is three times faster than the Bear and can fly four times further than the RAF's Quick Reaction Alert squadrons. Putin has also increased the size of his Special Forces troops and improved his long-range nuclear missiles. The RAF Typhoon fighters will continue to intercept and escort Russian aircraft that travel through international airspace within the UK's area of interest.", "article": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards Britain which can outrun the Royal Air Force\u2019s fastest fighter jets. The introduction of the Blackjack follows sorties by other Russian aircraft near Cornwall last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears. On that occasion, RAF pilots flying Typhoon jets easily caught up with two propeller-driven Bear bombers and directed their crews away from UK airspace. Scroll down for video. The top speed is the same... but our range is less: British Typhoon compared to the Russian Blackjack. The incident led to Russia\u2019s ambassador to Britain being summoned to the Foreign Office to explain the mission. But the Blackjack (Tu-160M) is three times faster than the Bear and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up Britain\u2019s Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) squadrons, according to experts. The bomber, also known as the White Swan because of its shape and huge wingspan, has just re-entered service in the Russian air force following a design overhaul. Experts say it is now more than a match for any UK aircraft, including the Typhoon, which is used to protect British airspace. Like the Blackjack, the Typhoon can reach Mach 2 \u2013 about 1,500mph. Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured)\u00a0has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West, according to experts. But while the Russian aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling, the Typhoon\u2019s limit is 1,800 miles, meaning the Blackjack could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its British counterpart without air-to-air refuelling. Dr Igor Sutyagin, Senior Russian Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said: \u2018The Tu-160M now has greater thrust and fuel efficiency and it can carry a larger payload of conventional missiles. \u2018The test flights were successful and the aircraft is now very potent. There is simply no British aircraft of its calibre or purpose. It is the largest bomber in the world.\u2019 The first two revamped Blackjacks passed a series of test flights last December and have now been passed for service. They are being prepared for possible action at air bases in Russia that are within easy striking distance of Britain. One, Monchegorsk air base near Murmansk, northern Russia, is just 1,000 miles from the British Isles. Ten more Blackjacks will be modernised before 2020. Dr Sutyagin added that the Blackjacks\u2019 revamp was part of a plan by President Putin to boost both Russia\u2019s arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers. It comes at a time of heightened tension between Russia and the West, and while Britain\u2019s Armed Forces are shrinking due to spending cuts. \u2018President Putin has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West,\u2019 said Dr Sutyagin. \u2018He has also improved his long-range nuclear missiles such as the Bulava, which is now very hard to detect on launch. It is lighter and more compact, too, so more warheads can be fitted into a submarine. 'He has also committed to the T-50 low-visibility jet. This stealth jet could lead to potentially massive changes in the distribution of military power around the world. 'He is doubling the number of his Special Forces troops, as well.\u2019 An RAF Typhoon aircraft from Number XI Squadron shadows a Russian Bear-H aircraft (file picture) Between now and 2020, the size of the Spetsnaz (Special Forces) regiments will increase from 15,000 to 32,000. Trained to the same level as Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS), they were used in Chechnya and, most recently, in eastern Ukraine where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by Russian separatists. Experts also believe Putin could send the Spetsnaz to the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, both Nato members, to organise resistance among ethnic Russians. Dr Sutyagin added: \u2018Military activity in Crimea and eastern Ukraine has borne all the hallmarks of the special Russian units \u2013 it would be a mistake to believe the same tactics might not be applied elsewhere.\u2019 The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been following the Blackjack and Russian stealth-jet programmes. But while the Typhoon cannot match the Blackjack\u2019s range, RAF sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air-to-air weapons and its agility. An MoD spokesman said: \u2018The primary role of the Royal Air Force is to defend the UK. We are aware of recent Russian military activity. 'RAF Typhoon fighters will continue to routinely intercept, identify and escort Russian aircraft that travel through international airspace within the UK\u2019s area of interest.\u2019"}

And now an amazing 150-year-old photograph has emerged of boys at the private school playing cricket - one of the earliest images ever taken of the sport. The earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match, and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere, has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. An 1860s photograph of young men playing cricket at Eton has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. It is thought to be the second oldest image of the sport ever taken. The photograph was signed by Victor A. Prout in pencil. It will be sold at auction by\u00a0Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester. Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, was a British leader who is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton College when he was a student in the 1780s. The Duke attended Eton, which was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI, before he joined the army in 1787 and later helped defeat Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. According to history, he touched the ground at Eton and claimed: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' His statements were construed by historians as references to the'manly character induced by games and sport' among the English youth. The previously unseen image was taken in the early 1860s and shows 11 young men dressed smartly in trousers and waistcoats. Resting on their bats, they pose for the photographer with the distinctive Eton College visible behind them. The photograph was taken by Victor A. Prout who signed it in pencil afterwards. Dating from around 1862, it was taken just five years after the first ever image depicting the sport. It is to be sold by Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and is expected to fetch at least \u00a3500. Auctioneer and Senior Valuer Chris Albury said: 'This early, and previously unknown, cricket photograph in this album probably dates from circa 1862, some five years after the earliest photograph of a cricket match.' The first ever photo of cricket was taken by Roger Fenton in 1857, a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and famous for his photographs of the Crimean War. He first captured the sport in during a match between the Royal Artillery and the Hunsdonbury Cricket Club at the Honourable Artillery Ground in Islington, London, 25 July 1857. Around 100 years before the image of taken the Duke of Wellington is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton where he was a student. Touching the ground, history claims he said: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' Eton College was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI to school 70 poor boys. The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441. The school has long been associated with cricket with its annual fixture against Harrow dating back to 1805. Cricket has long been part of Eton's sporting curriculum.

The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441. English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt (pictured) perhaps summed up the spirit of the 19th Century best, with his famous work known as 'Vita\u00ef Lampada' In the 19th century, character building through sports was said to be vital in morally equipping young men to achieve greatness later in life. Many held the view that'manly characteristics' were developed by gaming and sports, and that those who flourished on the field would go on to carve successful careers as soldiers or engineers. English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt perhaps summed up the spirit of the age best, with his famous work known as 'Vita\u00ef Lampada'. The poem, written in 1892, refers to how a schoolboy, a future soldier, learns selfless commitment to duty in cricket matches in the famous Close at Clifton College. Vita\u00ef Lampada, which means 'the torch of life', also makes reference to the Battle of Abu Klea in Sudan in January 1885. The poem, in full:. There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night\u2014. Ten to make and the match to win\u2014. A bumping pitch and a blinding light,. An hour to play and the last man in."}

Didier Drogba has only scored three Premier League goals this season, but is still important for Chelsea. Drogba is helping to mentor the likes of Kurt Zouma (left) as Chelsea push for the Premier League title. 'They're going to be there,' he said of Jose Mourinho's young core. 'We won't be any more  so it is up to us to give them all they need and pass it on to the younger players as well. 'It's important for us, the older players, to be there to support them, but at the same time it's even more important for them to take the lead now, to feel there is no restriction from us. 'They can play, they can talk, we can debate and exchange because all we're doing now is for the team - to be better next year, in two years and five.' However, Drogba also pointed out the benefit of keeping older stars like John Terry around, after the Chelsea captain signed a new contract. Drogba and Petr Cech were both at the club when Jose Mourinho won his first Premier League title. John Terry (centre) has recently signed a new contract, and will continue to help Zouma and Cahill develop.

Controversial: The home was described by luxury lifestyle magazine Luxe as 'too lush for words', but has caused fury among locals who say it is out of character with other beach huts, some of which are 100 years old. Luxury: Each of the four bedrooms has its own terrace, and the property sits in landscaped gardens which extend up and down the hill. However, as the property was built on the site of an old wooden beach hut, and is surrounded by other wooden huts some of which are 100 years old, it has attracted the ire of locals who say it is 'out of keeping' with the area. One Tripadvisor review of the area by Sandra L reads: 'This lovely spot is overlooked by an absolute monstrosity of a building - a carbuncle is the only suitable description. 'How this ever got planning permission is a mystery! My memory is of the chalet belonging to the Haven, a wooden building with a corrugated iron roof. I know we must move with the times, but I think this building is a big mistake and spoils the whole beach area.'

The House of Lords voted to commit future governments to spending at least 0.7 per cent of national wealth \u2013 currently around \u00a312billion a year \u2013 on overseas development. The new law will come into force within the next few weeks, after it receives royal assent from the Queen. Legislation forcing Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid is set to become law tonight. Last night Tories lined up to lambast the move, saying it is wrong for aid spending to be protected when savage cuts to defence are expected after the election. A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013/14 defence budget was \u00a334.3billion \u2013 just over this 2 per cent target and down from \u00a335.9billion in 2010/11, when the coalition took over. By contrast, the aid budget has soared from \u00a38.5billion in 2010 to \u00a311.5billion in 2013 \u2013 the year that the 0.7 per cent of gross national income was reached for the first time. When Margaret Thatcher left office, just 0.27 per cent of GNI went on aid. Legislation to set the aid target in stone was passed by the Lords despite opposition from Tory grandees including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, who has described the measure as \u2018gesture politics\u2019. Sir Gerald Howarth, the former Conservative defence minister, said aid spending should be cut to allow an increase in the defence budget \u2013 because Russia is increasing spending on arms and the Middle East is in flames. Foreign aid spending rose to more than \u00a311billion in 2013 as ministers moved to hit the 0.7% target. \u2018This is a dangerous world,\u2019 he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One. \u2018This is not a time to be cutting our defence in any case. If you ask me where you make the savings \u2013 you make them in overseas aid.\u2019 More than 300 Tory backbenchers are expected to rebel on Thursday by forcing a Commons vote on enshrining the 2 per cent defence target in law. Tory MP Peter Bone said: \u2018Most of my constituents would think ensuring the safety of this country is of greater importance than meeting the overseas aid budget. \u2018If the Government is prepared to accept that a percentage of gross national income should go toward a specific priority, it seems crazy that we can do this for overseas aid but not for defence. \u2018We should be putting the 2 per cent Nato target into law.\u2019 The pledge to introduce the law was part of the coalition agreement of 2010 \u2013 but opposition from many Conservative backbenchers meant it never saw the light of day as an official government bill. It had to be piloted through parliament by Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore. It was approved in the Commons earlier this year and yesterday was given an unopposed third reading in the Lords. n SACKED cabinet minister Andrew Lansley suffered fresh humiliation yesterday after being rejected for a top UN role that David Cameron is said to have promised him. The former health secretary, who was demoted two years ago after his NHS reforms ran into trouble, was tipped to become the UN aid chief. But the job has gone to fellow Tory MP Stephen O\u2019Brien, an ex-minister who will replace Valerie Amos as under-secretary for humanitarian affairs."}

But what makes American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, 65, so successful? In an interview with Alistair Campbell for his new book Winners And How They Succeed, she shared the secrets of her success. Anna Wintour shares the traits that have taken her to the top including being decisive and resilient. In a book extract in the Sunday Times' Style magazine, Wintour, who became American Vogue's editor in chief in 1988, reveals that being decisive, delegating and recovering fast from setbacks have taken her to the top - and kept her there. Having been fired from her role as a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar after just nine months in 1975, she said: 'Everyone should be sacked at least once in their career because 'perfection doesn't exist'. She added: 'It's important to have setbacks, because that is the reality of life.' The most powerful woman in fashion and editor of Vogue for almost 30 years is rumoured to have been the model for Miranda Priestly, the terrifying magazine editor who hires Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada. But her analysis of her own strengths is far more human and surprisingly humble than the film character as she asks whether 'journalist' is even the right word to describe what she does. Yet her most surprising trick is pretending to be sure of herself, even if she doesn't feel it. Anna Wintour, second left, sitting next to her daughter Bea Schaffer, earned admiration for wearing her signature dark glasses indoors during the Oscar ceremony. She said: 'It makes it clearer for everyone else. Most people prevaricate. I decide fast.' With the nickname 'Nuclear Wintour' owing to her frosty demeanour Wintour, was made artistic director of Conde Nast by her employer in 2013 and editorial director in July 2014. She attributes being organised and a good delegator to her success, and says there's no need to double and triple check what her staff are doing. 'People work better when they have responsibility,' she said. She also revealed that she has no idea how to make a dress, couldn't create an image from a photo shoot and can't write, and instead responds to other people's talents. Her other tips for getting to the top include getting up early - she rises at 5am everyday - and 'turning off' at the weekend.

Lufthansa, the airline that owned the budget airline, admitted that Lubitz had slipped through the safety net and should never have been flying.", "article": "Mental health checks in the civil aviation industry lack the rigour needed, a former BA pilot has claimed in the wake of this week's Germanwings disaster. Alastair Rosenschein, now an aviation consultant, made the comments after it was revealed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid an illness from his employers and crashed the plane into a mountain killing 149 people on board. 'This recent accident demonstrates that the mental health checks lack the rigour that is specifically required in a safety sensitive industry like civil aviation,' he said. Scroll down for video. Killer in the cockpit: Andreas Lubitz - pictured competing in a half-marathon in 2013 - was reportedly in the middle of a'relationship crisis' when he crashed the Germanwings airliner into the Alps, killing himself and 149 others. German detectives were also pictured carrying computer equipment from Lubitz's family home in the small town north of Frankfurt. Potential breakthrough: German detectives carry evidence boxes from the 28-year-old's apartment on the outskirts of Dusseldorf on Thursday. Yesterday, the boss of Germanwings admitted Lubitz had slipped through the'safety net' and should never have been flying. And today it was discovered the co-pilot hid an illness from his employers. Following a search of his Dusseldorf apartment, investigators revealed they had found torn-up sick leave notes - current ones and one issued for the day of the disaster. Lubitz locked the pilot out of the Airbus A320's cockpit before setting the plane's controls to descend into a rocky valley, French prosecutors said yesterday. He had previously been signed off from training with depression in 2008 and was reportedly receiving mental health support up until Tuesday's crash. The 28-year-old was also in the middle of the'relationship crisis' with his girlfriend in the weeks before the crash and may have been struggling to cope with a break-up,\u00a0German newspaper Bild reported. It was  claimed this morning that the couple may have previously been engaged to be married next year. Mr Rosenschein, who was previously a researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, added: 'The safety net has a very wide mesh and that mesh needs to be narrowed. 'Athough suicide among pilots is not uncommon, murder-suicide is extremely rare.' Slipped through the net: Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had suffered from depression and \u2018burnout\u2019 which had held up his career. Investigators enter Lubitz's house on the outskirts of Dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues. In a blunt admission, Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa, which owns the budget airline, admitted Lubitz had slipped through the safety net. \u2018The pilot had passed all his tests, all his medical exams,\u2019 he said. \u2018He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions. 'We have at Lufthansa, a reporting system where crew can report \u2013 without being punished \u2013 their own problems, or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment. 'All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\u2019 Lubitz passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by Lufthansa, according to\u00a0The Telegraph. The airline said Lubitz trained at the Lufthansa Flight Training School in Bremen. An assessment required by Germany's civil aviation authority, the DLR, plus standards imposed by Lufthansa were needed before he was accepted. However, although the process includes psychometric testing of the candidate's ability to work under pressure and handle stress, they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely, The Telegraph reported. Lufthansa, like other airlines, does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots. Investigation: \u00a0French prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder. Search: Teams working in the difficult Alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings. Debris from the jet, operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline, was found near Barcelonnette. New information about Lubitz's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat, which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend. Officers  found 'evidence of mental illness' but no suicide note, Der Spiegel reported. It is understood detectives have found significant material on Lubitz's computer, which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions. He reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying. However, he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly. Germany\u2019s Federal Aviation Office confirmed this morning that Lubitz had a medical condition noted in his pilot\u2019s records which required him to have a regular examination"}

A longtime science teacher in Ohio has been reprimanded for failing to report a student who allegedly took a bottle of illegal liquor he had produced to class. Jennifer Thompson, 52, who has taught at Riverside middle school in De Graff for more than 20 years, reportedly tipped the moonshine down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities. According to Dayton Daily News, she was issued with a formal warning letter as a result, while the pupil in question was suspended from school. Thompson apparently knew the 13-year-old boy and another 14-year-old had created a still and were starting to produce alcohol. While she warned the duo it could be 'dangerous', investigators claim the tutor took no strict action to stop the operation. In January, a report from the Logan County Sheriff says the student brought some of the liquor to show in science class. Thompson disposed of it instead of alerting the principle. Under Ohio law, the illegal manufacture of moonshine is considered a first-degree misdemeanor - carrying the same charges as crimes including petty theft or assault. It is unclear whether the boy who took the moonshine to class will face juvenile delinquency charges in the case. Wrong move: The science teacher reportedly tipped the alcohol down the drain when she was shown it but did not alert authorities. Scene of the incident: An aerial shot of Riverside Local Schools School in Ohio. In the meantime he is said to be awaiting an expulsion hearing led by Riverside Schools. It is unclear how the news of the incident emerged. Riverside Local Schools Superintendent Scott Mann said he doesn't believe the student realized the seriousness of his actions. 'I think he wanted to show his science teacher and I don\u2019t think there was malicious intent at all,' he noted."}
{"abstract": "This week, figures released by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission showed that Uber cars now outnumber yellow cabs in the city. However, yellow cabs still have more rides per day than Uber cars. Uber's growth has flooded the market, lowering average incomes for all drivers, including yellow cab drivers.", "article": "New York City's storied yellow cabs are taking a back seat to black cars. Uber cars, often black sedans that can be summoned with smartphone apps, now outnumber the yellow taxis that city riders have hailed with a whistle and a wave for generations. It was a changing-of-the-guard moment that passed with little fanfare this week in figures released by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission: 14,088 registered Uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs. Uber cars, which are hailed by an app, now outnumber the yellow taxis in New York City, a place famous for its classic yellow cars (file photo) But it hardly means yellow cabs are out of favor. In fact, there are about 440,000 yellow cab rides a day, compared to just 20,000 to 30,000 Uber rides. That's because Uber drivers often own their own cars and work less than 40 hours a week, while most yellow taxis are owned by cab companies, have more than one driver and are on the road close to 24 hours a day. 'Yellow cab rides significantly outstrip the number of black car rides,' said Meera Joshi, chairwoman of the taxi commission. 'So the number of their affiliated vehicles in and of itself doesn't paint a complete picture.' Uber was introduced in New York City in 2011 and has grown steadily in popularity, particularly among tech-savvy customers who are comfortable hailing rides through an app that shows when a car is on the way. A customer can even follow its progress with a blip on a street map. Similar companies such as Lyft use apps to connect with riders. Prices are comparable, but some Uber riders have complained about fare add-ons for larger vehicles and'surge pricing' during rush hour, bad weather or holidays. Figures released by the New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission shows that 14,088 registered Uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs in the city (file photo) 'I absolutely do love the convenience, and if it's not surge pricing I find the costs very comparable and in some cases cheaper than yellow taxis,' said Kerry Farrell, a paralegal who uses Uber about three times a week. Uber spokesman Matt Wing declined to comment on the significance of the numbers of Uber cars surpassing yellow cabs. But some drivers and their advocates grumbled that Uber's growth has flooded the market, lowering average incomes for all drivers. 'Uber having an unlimited number of cars means no drivers \u2014 taxi or black car and livery \u2014 will earn a decent living,' said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an advocacy group that includes both Uber and yellow cab drivers as members. Mamadou Diallo, who has been driving a yellow cab since 2004, said he once could count on at least 30 fares a day. But his take has dropped 30 to 40 percent since Uber and other such car services entered the New York market. 'It's a jungle,' he said, 'and the big fish always eat the small fish.' New York's 13,587 yellow cabs are in competition with smartphone-driven newcomers on city streets, especially the 14,088 registered Uber cars that now outnumber cabs. Here's a look at how the basic operations of the two compare. Yellow Cabs. Uber."}

Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal against Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday. NEWCASTLE (4-1-4-1) TIM KRUL 6 \u2013 Dutchman had little chance with either of the Arsenal goals but otherwise looked solid behind a makeshift defence. RYAN TAYLOR 6.5 \u2013 Sound defensively, getting in a good early block on Sanchez, and launched the attack for Newcastle\u2019s goal with a lovely nutmeg. Danny Welbeck and Ryan Taylor do battles as both vie for the ball during the battle at St James' Park. DARYL JANMAAT 6.5 \u2013 Pressed into action as an emergency centre-back in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini, and the full-back coped well on the whole. MIKE WILLIAMSON 5.5 - Can\u2019t claim to have come off best in his duel with Giroud and was too busy trying to wrestle the Frenchman when he headed in the second. JACK COLBACK 5.5 \u2013 First touch let him down on a couple of occasions, not least when he ended up conceding the freekick that led to Arsenal\u2019s first goal. Newcastle United's Spanish striker Ayoze Perez vies for the ball with Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista. VURNON ANITA 5 \u2013 Guilty of playing Colback into trouble on the first goal, and looked vulnerable at times. Replaced by Gutierrez with 20 minutes left.

SAMMY AMEOBI 5.5 \u2013 Had his moments but tended to drift in and out of the game. A little better in the second half. YOAN GOUFFRAN 6 \u2013 Another one who struggled to make an impact. Should have done better than poke an effort straight at Ospina from eight yards out in the 60th minute. Yoan Gouffran gets to grips with Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla during the match at St James' Park. REMY CABELLA 7 \u2013 Really came alive in the second half and did well to pick out Sissoko for the Newcastle goal.

Subs: Gutierrez (Anita 72), Elliot, Obertan, Riviere, Armstrong (for Ameobi 89), Satka, Kemen. Scorer: Sissoko 48. Booked: none. Moussa Sissoko of Newcastle United scores to halve the deficit against Arsenal in the Premier League match. ARSENAL (4-2-3-1) DAVID OSPINA 7 \u2013 Kicked the ball more than he handled it in the first half such was the lack of threat from Newcastle, but called upon to make some important saves after half-time. CALUM CHAMBERS 6 \u2013 Like the rest of Arsenal\u2019s defence, coasted through the first half but ended up hanging on towards the end. Rarely put a foot wrong though. GABRIEL PAULISTA 6 \u2013 One of three changes from the Monaco game in midweek and looked solid enough on his return to the line-up. Laurent Koscielny of Arsenal is tackled by Sissoko of Newcastle United during the Premier League match.

NACHO MONREAL 5.5 \u2013 Strolled through the first half but had his hands full after that as Cabella and Perez stepped up their game. FRANCIS COQUELIN 7 \u2013 Did well snuffing out any trouble in midfield and spilt blood for the cause after a bang in the face, ending the game in a blank shirt. Arsenal's Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez vies for the ball with Newcastle United's  Gouffran.

The self-confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected. The 25-year-old, from Glasgow, had no idea she had the deadly disease - which is usually diagnosed at birth - until her heart suddenly stopped beating. Ticking timebomb: Self-confessed fitness fanatic Karen MacLachlan had no idea she had a lethal, undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time. 'When I collapsed, my mum thought I'd tripped over,' she said. 'It wasn't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance. 'She thought I was dead because my skin had turned a deathly black colour as I lay lifeless on the floor.' Ms MacLachlan was rushed to hospital and put into a medically induced coma. And remarkably, after surgery to rewire her heart, she has made a full recovery. Ms MacLachlan was diagnosed with Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA). This is a rare heart condition where the main ventricle of the heart, which supplies oxygen to the body, is wired incorrectly. Usually, the condition is diagnosed at birth, but there is 90 per cent chance a patient will die from heart failure by the age of one if undetected. Ms MacLachlan said: 'At first, doctors believed my heart stopped as a result of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome not ALCAPA - it's very rare for someone to survive past infancy with it.' 'Doctors were amazed that I'd lived with this condition for so long and never had any problems before.' Indeed, she had always prided herself on being fit and healthy. 'Doctors asked if I'd struggled walking up hills, but I've walked the Great Wall of China - I'm really fit and active,' she said. 'I'd danced for 10 years, canoed one of the longest rivers in France and never had any symptoms, so it was a shock to everyone.' 'Even was taken aback because doctors told me I should have been so unwell, it was really scary. Danger:\u00a0The self-confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected. 'It's terrifying as I now know I could have died at any moment.' Months after her collapse, Ms MacLachlan underwent corective open heart surgery. She then had a year of rehabilitation to get her heart used to even the most gentle exercise. She said: 'After doctors fixed my heart I was really poorly, I didn't realise how much the surgery would affect me. 'I couldn't walk four steps without sweating buckets like I normally do during strenuous exercise. 'I had to learn to build up my energy and became physically fit again. 'Every hour I'd have to walk one length of my parents' hallway to try and build my strength up. 'It hurt to sit down on sofas and I'd struggle to lift myself up because I didn't have enough energy to push myself up. 'Mentally it was pretty draining as well - at first I was scared to leave the house in case my heart stopped again. The 25-year-old said:\u00a0'When I collapsed, my mum thought I'd tripped over. It wasn't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance' 'It took me a year to battle through everything but I've came out the other end independent and stronger again.' She now goes to the gym every day and takes the stairs everywhere she can. And she says she's glad she wasn't diagnosed\u00a0any\u00a0earlier. 'In some ways I'm glad I didn't know I had ALCAPA because I know I would have been wrapped up in cotton wool. If I knew about my condition I had this I don't think I would have gone off to climb mountains or go on adventure holidays. 'It took me a year to battle through everything but I've came out the other end independent and stronger again.'

Scroll down for video. Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless started the hashtag #FacesOfProstitution on social media at the weekend by posting this photo to share positive stories from the industry. The blog post suggested 75 per cent of female sex workers had been raped, 95 per cent were physically abused and 68 per cent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. It also questioned how many sex workers had been deceived by Pretty Woman, the iconic movie that starred Julia Roberts as a warm-hearted prostitute and Richard Gere as a lonely millionaire businessman who fall in love. The post said the movie, which has regained prominence around the 25th anniversary of its release last week, deceived women into leading lives of 'abuse, trauma and slavery'.

I worked in an establishment initially, an erotic massage parlour in Canberra, followed by nude modelling, porn and then escorting,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's probably weird for a lot of people to consider that there's a 'journey' that you can take in this industry, much the same as working your way through any industry or career, but I've had one.' 'There's a huge stigma against sex workers in Australia.\u00a0Pop culture generally feeds them the image of the down trodden, broken woman in sex work, which I'm not saying isn't a situation for some, but it's certainly not the situation for all. 'The fact that #FacesOfProstitution is trending makes me so happy. It's this massive symbol of unity amongst the industry, sex workers are feeling like they have a chance to stand up and be represented.' Savannah Sly posted this photo of herself saying she was sitting in a coffee shop, but no one would guess she was a sex worker.

He has not been charged because he got out of the vehicle before Mayer drove it onto the ice, officials said. Neither of the pair was injured in the incident. Police and U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene at 12.15am on Sunday following a  report of a truck 'doing donuts' on the frozen river near Gladney Avenue. When they arrived at the river, the witness who had dialed 911 told them they had seen Mayer climbing out of the truck and escaping across the iced-over river before the vehicle went down.

The result leaves the Black Cats one point and one place above the drop zone and owner Ellis Short believes a change of manager is needed to avoid relegation. Poyet \u2013 who leaves after 17 months in charge \u2013 was informed of the club\u2019s decision having taken training at the Academy of Light on Monday morning. Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone. Sunderland fans turned on manager Poyet during the defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday. Sportsmail reported earlier in the day that influential sporting director Lee Congerton had advised Short to sack Poyet. A statement on the club's website confirmed the news on Monday afternoon, in which Short said: 'I would like to thank Gus for his endeavours during his time at the club, in particular last season\u2019s \"great escape\" and cup final appearance, which will live long in the memory of every Sunderland fan. Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon looks dejected as Sunderland were thrashed at home by Villa. Gabriel Agbonlahor scored two of Aston Villa's goals in the 4-0 win on Saturday. 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. 'Sadly, we have not made the progress that any of us had hoped for this season and we find ourselves battling, once again, at the wrong end of the table. We have therefore made the difficult decision that a change is needed.' Poyet\u2019s position had become untenable after a breakdown in relationship with Congerton and the club\u2019s fans, thousands of whom streamed for the exits with the team trailing by four at half-time against Villa. A handful of supporters even tried to storm the dugout while some targeted the directors\u2019 box \u2013 including chief executive Margaret Byrne - leaving the club hierarchy in no doubt that a change was necessary. Holland boss Dick Advocaat has already spoken to the club about a short-term deal until the end of the season and he could be installed before Saturday\u2019s trip to West Ham. Congerton is close to Frank Arnesen \u2013 they worked together at Chelsea and Hamburg \u2013 and he is thought to have recommended Advocaat for the role. The new man will inherit a team which has won just once in 12 matches and is without a home goal in more than five hours. Poyet leaves Sunderland after just over a year in charge. Poyet was appointed by Sunderland in October 2013 following the sacking of\u00a0Paolo Di Canio. They were dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Bradford City last month and away fans fought among themselves at Valley Parade. Bizarrely, Poyet blamed the Press for Sunderland\u2019s woes after that game but his excuses did not wash with supporters. Former Rangers and Holland manager Dick Advocaat is one name in the frame to take over. The goodwill generated by last season\u2019s League Cup final appearance and their escape from relegation in the final weeks of the campaign had long since evaporated and few fans will be mourning his departure. Poyet\u2019s backroom team of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway are also expected to leave the club.

At the press conference yesterday, Mr Tsipras also renewed the demand for war reparations, saying: \u2018We must work on the issue of forced loans and Second World War reparations.\u2019 However Mrs Merkel said she viewed the demands as an attempt to distract from the need for economic reforms, adding: \u2018The issue of war reparations is closed from a political and legal point of view. The topic has no relationship with the crisis and its emergencies.\u2019 Tsipras is expected to present a list of reforms, hoping to unlock bailout funds to prevent Greece from running out of cash next month, Greek government sources said. The Greek government has insisted that Germany must repay a loan forced on occupied Athens in 1942 and make reparations for Nazi atrocities. European leaders are currently refusing to give Greece any more money unless the Left-wing government commits to reforms.

The two people fell about 70 feet (21 meters) Saturday when part of the Arch Rock overlook at Point Reyes National Seashore gave way. The day before the collapse, the Point Reyes National Seashore had posted a photo on Facebook of a fissure in the rock structure -- with a warning to use caution. \"Visitors using Bear Valley Trail to Arch Rock -- watch out! At the very end of the trail, the cliff is breaking away -- seen here in a photo taken Wednesday,\" the government organization said. The NPS said hazardous conditions had been reported to it on March 19. John Dell'Osso from the Point Reyes National Seashore told CNN that it had posted warnings after being notified last Thursday that a crack had formed in the arch. \"We posted all kinds of notices up and down that particular trail, which is how probably how 99% of the people who would hike that far would (go), and all around our visitors' center in Trail Heads, just to warn people of the hazard that was out there,\" Dell'Osso said. \"We didn't know what could happen and what unfortunately did happen is on Saturday afternoon a large portion of that overlook actually collapsed down onto the beach and partly onto the ocean,\" he said. \"The tragedy is that there were two people that were standing out there who fell with all of that rubble.\" On Monday, the Marin County Sheriff's Office named the deceased as 58-year-old Nancy Blum, from California. It said she had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. Saturday \"when a structural collapse of the rock occurred.\" After emergency personnel reached Blum and her hiking companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death. \"The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Bluffs along the California coast are known for being unstable, according to the park service. The Arch Rock trail that runs along that part of the coast has been closed until further notice.

Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his'suicidal tendencies' were introduced in response to Nazi rule. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent, it was reported by the Times. With respect to medical data, the criminal code can ultimately leave doctors between a rock and a hard place. For it only allows them breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Still reeling from last Tuesday's disaster that killed 150 people, many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege. A transport policy expert from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), Dirk Fischer, said strict confidentiality policy should be loosened when their patients work in sensitive fields. Professionals such as pilots'should only see doctors designated by their employers,' Fischer told the daily Rheinische Post. He added that such doctors'should be relieved of their pledge of secrecy in communication with the employer and the aviation authority'. Military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the Germanwings plane crash in Seyne-les-Alpes. A military vehicle  carrying a crash site investigation team heads towards the site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash, in Seyne-les-Alpes in the French Alps. Member of parliament Thomas Jarzombek, also of the CDU, called for the creation of a commission of experts to study how to handle illnesses among those whose jobs mean they hold the welfare of many people in their hands. German prosecutors said Monday that Lubitz had been diagnosed'several years ago' with suicidal tendencies and was still in treatment. Although his symptoms had abated, he was apparently written off sick on the day the Airbus crashed. Media reports have indicated that Lubitz, 27, was taking medication for severe depression and was being treated for problems with his vision, possibly for a potentially career-ending detached retina. Investigators evaluating voice recorder data say Lubitz remained silent and breathed calmly as he allegedly locked his captain out of the cockpit and slammed the plane into a French mountainside. Carsten Spohr, the head of parent company Lufthansa, has said the airline was utterly unaware of any health issues that could have compromised Lubitz's fitness to fly, calling him '100-percent airworthy'. His professional performance and behaviour had never attracted cause for concern, Spohr added. The German Medical Board has clear ethical policies on doctor-patient relations: 'Doctors must remain silent about what is told to them in confidence or what they learn in their capacity as doctors.' It applies even after the death of a patient and includes keeping medical facts secret even from family members of the person in treatment, under penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine.

And now the site obsessed with beauty is facing an ugly backlash after thousands of people have started trolling the site in a bid to take revenge on their elitist policies. In an attack coordinated via social media, uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before then attempting to subvert the system by voting in 'ugly' people and voting out any good-looking potential members. Scroll down for video. Elitist dating site BeautifulPeople.com is facing a backlash from 'ugly' trolls after removing 3,000 members for letting themselves go. Uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before attempting to subvert the system. Last week it was revealed that BeautifulPeople.com had expelled over 3,000 people for not maintaining the appearance necessary to meet the high standards expected on the site. The move was welcomed by most of the member - but angered outsiders who disagreed with the site's selective policy. The 'Ugly' troll attack originated in Russia where over 2,700 applications were made to the site in a few hours. Over half of these were fake profiles and part of the ugly troll army. Similar coordinated attacks have come from the United States and the United Kingdom with 1,435 U.S. 'trolls' removed from the site and 400 from the UK in the past few days. BeautifulPeople.com is a site that is designed only with Beautifu lPeople in mind where users vote for those they think are the most attractive to stay on the site. 2,700 of the recent surge in fake profiles were from Russia, where the revenge campaign began. Greg Hodge, the managing director of BeautifulPeople.com, said: 'We had large spikes in numbers applying to join the site using profiles which immediately raised the suspicions of our administrators. 'Initially the scale of applications from specific geographical areas \u2013 Russia, the United States and the UK in particular \u2013 caused concern, when we examined the applications in more detail, we noticed a large number of what appeared to be fake profile pictures. 'We then traced this back to various social media sites calling for an attack on our site.' 'People had come together on forums such as Reddit to discuss the site and how they could hijack it by creating the fake profiles.' This is not the first time the site has been under attack. BeautifulPeople.com has been hit with 'denial of service' attacks, and had their rating system sabotaged in 2011. In response the site has introduced new measures to verify profiles and wannabe members must now take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of card with their name and date written on it. Recently 3,000 members were removed because organisers felt they had let themselves go.\u00a0This chap is an example of somebody who would make the BeautifulPeople.com grade. The site introduced a system of validated membership in 2012, whereby entrants are encouraged to take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper with their name and date handwritten on it to prove that their pictures are genuine. Validated members get a'verification stamp' on their profiles. Prior to the attack this feature was optional, but the makers have been forced to make profile verification mandatory. BeautifulPeople.com is the first dating site to force all users to prove they are genuine. Hodge said: 'Fake profiles are the number one problem in the online dating market today. 'We have always led the field in combating this. In taking this next step, we believe we will all but eliminate disingenuous profiles on our site and set the example for the online dating market as a whole. Online daters do not want their time wasted with fraudulent profiles.' The creators of BeautifulPeople.com are husband and wife duo Genevieve and Greg Hodge. He added: 'Having an exclusive dating site is not without controversy. There will always be a degree of jealousy from those who don't make the cut. 'Thankfully, through swift action by our administrators, vigilant members and the introduction of an extra level of verification has meant that we have been able to root out the attackers and ensure that our site remains beautiful and exclusive.' Entry to BeautifulPeople.com is only possible after passing a democratic rating process, where members of the opposite sex vote 'Yes definitely', 'Hmm yes, O.K', 'Hmm no, not really' and 'NO Definitely NOT' based on photographs and a brief profile submitted by new applicants. After the recent cull, over 800,000 members remain on the site, representing 190 countries and almost every ethnic and cultural background. A global average of one in ten applicants that apply to the site are accepted."}

The soldiers have recently been taking part in the Atlantic Resolve exercise, which was intended to demonstrate NATO's readiness to defend its members. Poland borders Ukraine and Russia and the conflict between the two countries has caused anxiety there. Putin, in particular, is seen as the main driving force behind the war, allegedly sending Russian troops to support the rebels in the east who want independence from the Ukrainian government. In just a year, it has cost more than 5,600 lives - and Russia's neighbours have become increasingly concerned Putin will turn his attention to them next. Lithuania, for example, feels the threat from Moscow feels is so real the government plans to reintroduce military conscription. But so far, America and the rest of Europe have refused to show any sort of military might towards the former Soviet Union - while Putin has made sure the rest of the world is in no doubt of the strength of his armed forces. Just this week, Putin boasted of a massive military exercise across his country, involving 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft, marking the beginning of a series of such drills this year. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin Tuesday that the manoeuvres were aimed at checking the readiness of the newly formed group of forces in the Arctic, as well as the military's capability to quickly field troops to several theatres of operations.

The convoy of American vehicles began their trip from Estonia last week and are travelling through Eastern Europe on their way to Germany. Zdzislaw Narel, 60, said it was a historic moment to see the U.S. forces parade through Bialystok. He said: 'This really means a lot to us.

Our new innovative solutions, which integrate wireless charging into home furnishings, will make life at home simpler.\u2019 Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally.

In the spotlight: Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally. Starting out: One technology industry analyst said it was a'very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology' Menno Treffers, chairman of the Wireless Power Consortium - which developed Qi - said the new collection shows customers 'the beauty and simplicity of wireless charging'. The most common type of wireless charging is known as inductive charging, which works on a well-known but rarely-used principle most often seen in electric toothbrushes. It was discovered by British scientist Michael Faraday in 1831. Mobile phones are using a more advanced version of the technology, which can operate over centimetres, rather than millimetres. The docking station has a coil within the charger, which generates an electrical field around the device.

{"abstract": "Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian lawyer, is leading a new slate of Arab parties in the upcoming Israeli election. If successful, they could become the third-largest party in the Knesset, potentially giving them the balance of power. Odeh hopes to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and Arabs, and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel.", "article": "Jerusalem (CNN)In a sea of Jewish parties campaigning at Hebrew University, Ayman Odeh was the star attraction. But this powerful new face in Israeli politics is not Jewish. While he is an Israeli citizen, the charismatic 41-year-old lawyer is of Palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million Israeli Arabs living in Israel. Under Odeh's leadership, Israel's tiny, splintered Arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the Joint List. Come election day on Tuesday, they are poised to take as many as 15 seats. This could potentially make them the third-largest party in the Knesset after Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his main rival, the Zionist Camp coalition, potentially giving them the balance of power. It is a game-changer, giving a significant voice to one-fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. His most immediate goal is to deny a new term to Netanyahu, who he says has led the \"most racist government in history.\" \"Netanyahu says the danger to Israel is not Palestinians in the West Bank, but rather Arabs in Israel. What is that telling me as a citizen of Haifa?\" he asked in an interview on Saturday. \"With 15 seats in the Knesset, no one will ever be able to ignore us again.\" Until now, Arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences. They run the spectrum from communist to Islamist. But a law passed by the last Knesset, sponsored by the right-wing party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the Knesset. Many believed Lieberman's goal was to push the Arab parties out of the Knesset. It's a theory that was given credence when, in recent televised debate, Lieberman warned Odeh, \"You are here for now.\" \"Why are you even here?\" Leiberman said to Odeh. Baiting him by accusing him of \"representing terror groups,\" Lieberman turned to Odeh and said, \"You're not wanted here.\" Odeh politely noted that his Joint List was polling well ahead of Lieberman's party. \"I'm very wanted in my homeland,\" he said. \"I'm part of the scenery. I resemble it.\" With that calm, dignified response, Odeh attracted political star status among Jews and Arabs alike. At the Hebrew University forum, event students campaigning for the Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Party wanted to take selfies with him. More importantly, he has given hope to the 1.6 million Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality. In the Wadi Nisnas neighborhood of Haifa where Odeh grew up, the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son. Odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician, speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the Joint List gets enough seats to change the face of the Israeli government. Over hummus and stuffed vegetables, he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and its Arab population, speaking about issues such as education, housing, employment for women, public transportation in Arab towns and recognition of unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev. Growing up, he says he identified with Malcolm X. But as he got older, he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. With a large block in parliament, Odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel. \"What makes people vote is the hope of change,\" he said. \"We have been ceding hope again and again. But we are 20% of the population. We can prevent the right from forming a government.\" There is some skepticism here that Arabs will finally have a say in how the government is run, but most are hopeful. Sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street, Sami Abuliat says Odeh is a good spokesman for Palestinians living inside Israel. \"We've asked for so many rights we don't we won't get,\" Abuilat says. \"The big eat the small. But united, we can be strong. This is a good first step.\" If, as many expect, Likud or Labor fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government, they may be forced to join together in a \"national unity\" government. That would make the next biggest group of parties, and Odeh, the official opposition. It's a position he says he would prefer over joining an Israeli government, which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the Palestinians.

Bournemouth striker Wilson just cannot believe his goal has been disallowed by referee Lee Mason. 'You'll have to ask the referee why the goal was not allowed, I don't think he had a particularly good game and that's an understatement.

The two countries are working together to defeat ISIS, but the U.S. is also wary of Iran's nuclear program and is seeking a comprehensive agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the U.S. to express his concerns about the negotiations.", "article": "(CNN)In 1984 Margaret Thatcher met Mikhail Gorbachev (before he became Soviet leader) for the first time. Asked of her impressions, she said: \"We can do business together. We both believe in our own political systems. He firmly believes in his; I firmly believe in mine. We are never going to change one another.\" \"Doing business together\" might sum up the Washington-Tehran relationship today. They have overlapping interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, perhaps even in Yemen -- as well as the shared goal of an agreement on Iran's nuclear program, if not how to reach it. The Obama administration has a keen interest in coaxing Iran back into the \"community of nations\" because it is a regional power, a major player in a volatile part of the world. Were the nuclear talks to leave Iran as a \"threshold state\" -- capable of becoming a nuclear power in short order -- Turkey, Egypt and others in the region also might be tempted also to go nuclear. And Israel might carry out its threat of a military strike on Iranian facilities. But U.S. and Iranian interests converge in more immediate ways. Defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- the most high profile and urgent objective of U.S. foreign policy -- requires Iranian help, and quite a lot of it. Beyond coalition airstrikes, ground forces are comprised of the Iraqi security forces, Shia militias and Iranian advisers and officers. In some areas, the Iranian air force has been active. On Sunday, Iraqi troops and the militias began an offensive to retake Tikrit and the province of Salahuddin from ISIS. Next to Mosul, Tikrit may be ISIS' most important holding in Iraq. On the frontlines, according to the Iranian Fars news agency, was none other than the leader of Iran's Quds Force (or Revolutionary Guard Corps), Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani -- often dubbed Iran's spymaster -- has huge influence in both Baghdad and Damascus. And the Revolutionary Guards have influence over the powerful Shia militia in Iraq known as Hashid Shaabi that is an important component of the fightback against ISIS. The Institute for the Study of War observed that \"the presence of an Iranian general, other Iranian advisers, and Shia militias on the ground alongside Iraqi Sunni fighters to retake a major Sunni provincial capital will be a significant test case for the success of similar future anti-ISIS operations.\" And not only is Iranian help needed in defeating ISIS, but Iranian restraint will be required in preserving Iraq as a single and (dare one hope) stable state thereafter. To many observers, former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki set the stage for ISIS' rise through his increasingly sectarian and anti-Sunni policies. But now the excesses of some Shia militia in Iraq threaten to alienate the Sunni tribes that Maliki's successor, Haidar al-Abadi, is trying to woo. In a veiled reference to alleged abuses by Shia militia of Sunni civilians, Prime Minister Abadi ordered all forces taking part in the Tikrit operation to take \"utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property.\" But he needs Tehran's help in reining in the Hashid Shaabi. A similar environment may yet produce a U.S.-Iranian \"understanding\" in Yemen. The Iranian-backed Houthi militia -- a Shia sect -- is now in power (at least in the capital, Sanaa). The Houthis are, ostensibly, hostile to the United States, and Washington would rather see President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi back in charge. But the Houthis and Yemeni troops are battling al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which the U.S. regards as one of al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliates. Even so, the same risk as in Iraq applies: Sunni tribes in Yemen may side with AQAP as the lesser of two evils, effectively partitioning the country. There is no clear-cut link between the negotiations on a nuclear deal and U.S.-Iranian co-operation elsewhere. Last week, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Congressional hearing: \"I really don't think that the negotiations, one way or the other, will have much bearing on what [the Iranians] do in Iraq or any place they are trying to exert their influence, meaning Syria or now Yemen.\" In any case, a substantive agreement on Iran's nuclear program does not seem imminent. Ahead of yet another meeting in Switzerland with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javid Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that \"unless Iran is able to make the difficult decisions that will be required, there won't be a deal.\" And he was at pains to insist the U.S. would not settle for anything less than a comprehensive, watertight agreement. \"No deal is better than a bad deal because a bad deal could actually make things less secure,\" Kerry said. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is in the U.S. to tell Congress that the"}

The astonishing pictures show humans are not the only couples capable of having lover's tiffs with this lion pair having a particularly vicious-looking argument. The lion was busy trying to show off his alpha male credentials by baring his teeth in an attempt to attract the female but she appeared to take offence, lashing out with her sharp claws and swiping at his face. Lunge: This is the moment lioness shows just how annoyed she is with her other half, who sits there without reacting to her bite. What did I say? The lioness launches towards the astonished male who just stands there and braves the ferocious attack. Fearsome: The situation seems to escalate when she takes a swipe at him while continuing to growl and show her teeth to the poor male. Take that: The lioness is inches away as she takes a swipe at the beleaguered male who takes a step back to avoid her swing. Grin and bear it: The male lion just stands there as the lioness gets whatever is upsetting her off her chest at the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Keen snapper Massimo Mei, 53, captured the human-like moment on a trip to the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya last month. Mr Mei, from Rome, Italy, said: 'I was surprised at the scene and their behaviour. It really looked like human expressions - although maybe towards the end of a relationship not at the beginning. 'The expressions of the male were funny and I struggled not to laugh while I took pictures. It was a shock when the female turned and attacked him I wasn't expecting this.' Not impressed: The grumpy lioness swishes her tail and shows her sharp teeth to the large male who looks bemused at why she is so upset. Not so toothless: He finally snaps back by growling and showing a glimpse of his gnashers during the lovers tiff captured by a photographer. Fortunately the pair appeared to make up shortly afterwards after spending some time cooling off from their antics in the Africa sun. 'He was trying to show his teeth and convince the female he is a good powerful male, an alpha male,' said Mr Mei. 'But she tested him almost like she was annoyed.' Stalking: The fight seemed to start after the lion was seen following the female, causing her to react and fend off his advances. Nervous: He looks unsure of his next move as she lies low in the grass ready to pounce if he comes too close at the nature reserve in Kenya. Lovers and haters: His persistence seems to pay off as the couple are pictured lying together looking far happier just moments later. Far more relaxed: The lioness looks sleepy as she uses her paw to rub her eye now shortly after swiping it at the male lion. Who me? The duo look like they are talking over their differences with the male getting more of a say now things have cooled down."}

Laura and her team of legal experts are taking their case to the European Court of Justice, hoping to prove that the law contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights.", "article": "A dominatrix based in Scotland is challenging a new law in Northern Ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex. Laura Lee, 37, believes the legislation will put women's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground. In response, she's assembled a 'crack team' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the European Court of Justice. For the past 18 years, Laura has earned her living as a sex worker, travelling between Scotland and Ireland and juggling the job with motherhood, studying and activism. Laura Lee, 37, has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger. 'The work I do is very diverse,' Laura said. 'I'm a dominatrix, I provide a \"girlfriend experience\" and I also work with the disabled and terminally ill.' Laura says her clients fall into three categories. 'The first group are what I call my Duracell bunnies,' she said. 'These are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for, which of course it's not. They can be difficult to deal with but they're good fun. 'I see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off. It can be because they drifted apart from their wife but, in some cases, it's sadder; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's. 'Sometimes it's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they've come to the conclusion that it's better for everybody. Laura says her clients fall into three categories - including 'Duracell bunnies' who 'pound away' Until June 1, laws governing prostitution in Northern Ireland remain similar to the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that prostitution itself is legal, but most activities associated with it (such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel) are illegal. Once the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act comes into force, it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in Northern Ireland. 'The third category are my older guys. They're usually widows, terribly lonely, and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else.' Laura is careful when choosing her clients, ensuring that she's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve, especially when they're booking her as a dominatrix. 'I get a good grasp before-hand of what they're expecting,' she said. 'We pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries. This could be through things like spanking, caning, cross-dressing or role play.' At the moment, transactions like this between Laura and her Northern Irish clients are legal. However, from June 1, a new law will mean that men who pay Laura for sex could be arrested. The legislation is being championed by Democratic Unionist peer Lord Morrow. It will make Northern Ireland the first region in the UK to ban payment for sex between consenting adults. Laura says she is a dominatrix providing a 'girlfriend experience' The so-called 'Swedish model' \u2013 which makes it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it \u2013 has been heavily criticised by groups including the World Health Organisation and Amnesty International. They say there's no evidence it works and that, instead, it causes real harm to women. Police in Northern Ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister, David Ford, has said to will be hard to enforce. Importantly, a Department of Justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law. 'Even women who've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients,' Laura said. The law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking, although the Department of Justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it. Last year, there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in Northern Ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers. Laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. The main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability\u00a0as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest. 'Lord Morrow has effectively said that he really couldn't care less about the welfare of sex workers,' she said. Once the law comes in, the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to Northern Ireland's High Court and finally to the European court of human rights. The team will challenge the legislation on several articles. They are hoping to prove that Lord Morrow's law contravenes the European Convention on"}

Resplendent in a crimson ensemble, 43-year-old Maxima donned protective glasses and watched from a wharf in Hamburg alongside her husband. Perhaps not finding the eclipse quite as dramatic as she had hoped, the Argentina-born royal soon began laughing and whipped off her glasses. Scroll down for video. Watching the eclipse: The Netherlands' Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander watch the eclipse. Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in a bright crimson ensemble, complete with matching gloves. Impressed: King Willem-Alexander appeared impressed with what he saw, pointing up towards the eclipse. The Dutch royal couple are currently in the middle of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany with Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg on their itinerary. In Britain, millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the Moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic, resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. Is that it? A less enamoured Maxima took off her glasses early and turned away. On tour: The Dutch royals are touring Hamburg today as part of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany. Meeting: They are attending a meeting aimed at boosting Dutch business and trade links. Gas: The royal couple are also being shown a new barge that is fitted out to carry liquefied natural gas. Maxima and Willem-Alexander arrived Germany yesterday, after completing a short three-day tour of Denmark. Having waved goodbye to their Danish hosts at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport, they flew on to L\u00fcbeck where they were greeted by excited well-wishers clutching hand-painted portraits. After a lunchtime reception, they then continued on to the Th\u00fcnen Institute for Organic Farming in Trenthorst, where Maxima came dangerously close to getting her shoe stuck in some silage. Along with watching the eclipse, today's schedule includes a meeting at Hamburg's\u00a0Fischauktionshalle to discuss business opportunities for Dutch firms in Germany. The royals will also be shown a newly-built barge, named the Hummel, which is designed to carry liquefied natural gas. All natural: Yesterday, Maxima came close to treading in some silage (fermented hay) during a farm visit. Looking around: The Dutch royals were touring the\u00a0Th\u00fcnen Institute for Organic Farming in Trenthorst. Warm welcome: The couple arrived in\u00a0L\u00fcbeck to be met by well-wishers proffering portraits of them. Maxima and Willem-Alexander will also tour the Joop van den Ende Academy, which focuses on innovation  in theatre technology - also a speciality of the Dutch performing arts sector. So keen are the Dutch royals on giving local performers a boost, they flew four dancers from Amsterdam to Copenhagen for a performance on Wednesday night. The men, all from the Het International Choreographic Arts Centre, got their big moment during a banquet hosted by Maxima and Willem-Alexander for the Danish royals. Designed to give Dutch culture a platform, the minimally-clad performers treated Denmark's Queen Margrethe and her family to an unusual modern dance performance. Watching from the front row was Maxima herself, elegant in a patriotic russet dress beside the Scandinavian country's Crown Prince Frederik. Interesting: The couple spent their last night in Denmark treating their hosts to a Dutch dance performance. Keep smiling: Maxima appeared to enjoy the modern dance performance and beamed throughout. Looking good: The 43-year-old Dutch Queen looked fabulous in a patriotic russet gown. Round of applause: All the royals politely applauded at the end of the performance."}

And it seems the show has even influenced affluent households thousands of miles away in China. Young Chinese people are\u00a0paying \u00a3140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy families hire help, the People's Daily Online reported. Students at the International Butler Academy, in Chengdu, are drilled daily on ironing perfect creases into tablecloths, polishing silverware and identifying the correct cutlery to accompany an eight-course banquet. Students at the International Butler Academy in Chengdu, China, pay \u00a3140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy Chinese families hire help. Tasks also include balancing a platter  and placing food on a plate using just a fork and spoon. Thomas Kaufmann, head instructor at the school, said: 'Downton Abbey is so famous here in China, that is the standard we are measured at. 'In the last few years the demand for butlers has become bigger and bigger. So it is logical for us to have teachers here.' Mr Hu is one of dozens of students who have enrolled in the school's six-week course, which costs 40,000 yuan (\u00a34,300). He previously worked for U.S. casino magnate Steve Wynn, where tasks included wiping fingerprints from his phone and picking out particular chocolates from assortment packs. He said: 'In the whole world there are more and more rich people. And especially in China, they want someone to take care of the smaller things.

'Butlers don't only serve wealthy families, but also multinational bosses. These people are successful. To make these kind of people feel relaxed and happy, I get a sense of achievement.' Each morning classes start with a round of dusting, cleaning and polishing. Students are also expected to be able to correctly position a water jug. A butter-knife laid a centimetre out of place can lead to failure. Using rulers to make sure the distances are correct is not unknown. Another student Chrissy Yan described the training - especially laying a table - as 'hard'. But she said: 'I want to lead a team of Chinese butlers which will be known worldwide. I want to be asked to travel the world.' The Academy, a beautiful house, opened in response to the increasing demand for domestic servants. Men and women are allowed to train as butlers and complete the same tasks before they finish. Above, two students pour tea. Cutlery, plates and jugs have to be perfectly in line and students fail if they are a centimetre out of place. A butler can typically expect to earn 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,150) a month. Their duties also include more mundane tasks such as fetching groceries, walking the dog, organising cleaning staff and polishing furniture and shoes. The Academy is Dutch-run but partly backed by a Chinese real-estate firm, which offers butler services to potential homeowners as the property market gets tougher. Mr Kaufmann added: 'It is easier to train a Chinese person in the butler trade than it is to train a Western butler in Chinese language and culture.' China is home to more than a million people with assets above \u00a31million, according to wealth publisher Hurun. Between 2004 and 2010 the number of Chinese billionaires rose from three to 64. A short stroll away from the Academy a billboard for a new housing estate shows a grinning man in a suit and bow tie, promising to bring 'the elegance of British butlering service into everyday life'.

The Spanish double world champion was ruled out of the opening race in Australia by doctors treating him for the effects of a high speed crash. Alonso has been training hard for his planned comeback at the Malaysian Grand Prix in nine days' time and used the McLaren simulator to hone his mental preparations. The CNN-sponsored team announced the news on Twitter, showing McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier and Alonso at the team's headquarters in Woking, England. Alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky. McLaren had explained that Alonso's \"accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time.\" After getting back to race preparation in the simulator, McLaren tweeted that it had been a good day for Alonso, \"focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures.\" The media enjoyed a guessing game in Australia about just how Alonso might have reacted to events in Melbourne, where Lewis Hamilton and his mighty Mercedes dominated while Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button finished in last place. Dane Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the recuperating Spaniard, was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid. Alonso left Ferrari at the end of the 2014 season to rejoin McLaren, which is experiencing teething as it renews technical partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda for 2015. In his response on Twitter, Alonso chose to focus on congratulating Spanish rookie Carlos Sainz, who finished ninth on his Toro Rosso debut and who was inspired by Alonso as he plotted his own racing career. \"Congratulations to @carlosainz for the great weekend in Australia!! And of course to Hamilton and Mercedes for the win!! See you in Malaysia,\" Alonso's message read. Meanwhile, Boullier is focused on finding improvements in the car's pace and performance for the next race on Sepang's sizzling circuit, which is also very physically demanding on the drivers. \"We know we have a mountain to climb as far as performance is concerned,\" the Frenchman said in a McLaren statement. \"In two weeks' time we'll be racing in Sepang [Malaysia], where the weather is bound to be extremely hot and humid. \"I'm not going to be rash enough to predict a form upswing in so short a time frame, but we'll be working flat out between now and then to make performance and reliability gains in any and every way we can, of that you may be 100 per cent certain.\""}

The ministry says the tomb, found near the southern city of Luxor, dates back to the New Kingdom of the 18th Dynasty (1543-1292 BC)\u00a0\u2014 the most famous of ancient Egypt dynasties. The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains, between the famed valleys of the Kings and Queens over the town of al-Qurna. Scroll down for video. A team working near the historic city of Luxor has found not one, but two ancient tombs. Both tombs feature astonishing murals which are believed to date back to the 18th Dynasty of the Egyptian New Kingdom. This means the tombs were likely created sometime between 1543-1292BC. The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains. Incredible photographs distributed by the ministry show a tomb with bright green and brown paintings with hieroglyphics with murals that depict both celebrations and everyday activity, and despite their age are still remarkably vibrant and colorful. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damaty said in a statement that the tombs do sadly appear to have been looted at some point and\u00a0the sarcophogi containing the bejeweled mummies were missing. 'The tomb contains many stunning scenes with bright colours painted on plaster,' Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty said in a statement. 'Many of scenes represent the tomb owner and his wife in front of an offering table and a view of a goddess nursing a royal child as well as scenes of the daily life,' he added. The tomb was discovered by a team of American archaeologists alongside an Egyptian inspectors' team in the city of Luxor, 700 kilometres (435 miles) south of Cairo. However, the temple guard's final resting place had been vandalised for unknown reasons. The T-shaped tomb 'was deliberately damaged in ancient times,' said Sultan Eid, the ministry's general director for the Upper Egypt region. 'The name and titles of the tomb owner, some hieroglyphic texts and scenes in addition to the names of the god Amun were deliberately erased,' Eid added. The first tomb was discovered on March 2, and the second was discovered on March 10. The second tomb is believed to be that of Sa-mut and his wife, Ta-Khaeet. The first tomb meanwhile is believed to be that of Sa-Mut's father, Amenhotep. Luxor, a city of some 500,000 people on the banks of the Nile in southern Egypt, is an open-air museum of intricate temples and pharaonic tombs. Eldamaty said in a separate statement that a royal rest house belonging to King Thutmosis II, also from the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom period, had been discovered in the Suez Canal province of Ismailia. The murals depict both celebrations and everyday activity, and despite their age are still remarkably vibrant and colorful.

'I had to get on the end of it, so if it meant colliding with the post, I had to. I was just glad to get the goal. 'I just got to do the right thing and ice it because it will definitely hurt tomorrow, but no pain, no gain.' After Palace beat Saturday's opponents 3-1 at Selhurst Park Zaha refused to get carried away as Alan Pardew's side close in on the top half of the table. The former Manchester United winger grimaces after smacking against the post. Zaha lays on the turf injured after the collision with the upright and later had to be substituted. 'Theres a lot to be done so we'll take every game as it comes. I don't know how high we can go, we're playing well. We've got to keep a steady head.' James McArthur and Joel Ward added two goals in ninety seconds just before half time as Palace ran riot in the opening 45 before Matt Phillips pulled a goal back for the visitors with a 40-yard stunner in the second half."}

Once a brilliant shade of blue, the Morning Glory pool's appearance has altered dramatically since the 1950s, thanks to an accumulation of coins, rubbish and natural debris. The pool has been dubbed the Fading Glory, due to the transformation from its original colour to the yellowy-green hue it has today. Scroll down for video. Morning Glory in the Yellowstone National Park was once a brilliant shade of blue, but now owes its yellow tinge to debris and coins thrown in over the years. The Morning Glory hot spring in 1940. The photograph reveals a stark contrast to the fiery colours now exhibited at the tourist attraction. The popular tourist attraction sees three million visitors flock to gaze at its psychedelic waters in Wyoming, USA. The site first gained popularity in the 1940s when a million tourists would visit the site. Pool on fire! The fierce colours are influenced by how light interacts with the water\u2019s depth, with yellow and orange colours in the shallows and green in the deep waters. The rainbow hot spring has been clogged up with debris, which block the heat vents, and affecting the water circulation in the pool. It is estimated that the destruction of the hot spring has been building up for decades. Research by Montana State University and Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany helped to create a model that could depict the hot spring's colours from over a century ago, when it was less frequented by visitors. Now nearly three million tourists flock to Yellowstone National Park, compared to the one million in the 1940s, which has led to the build-up of debris in the pool. As the underwater vents started to get clogged up, water circulation was affected, decreasing the temperature of the waters and causing a migration of the orange-coloured bacteria towards the centre. Adam Hoffman from Science Friday said: 'Pigments produced by swaths of those microbes\u2014called microbial mats\u2014are responsible, at least in part, for the brilliant yellows, greens, and oranges that now tinge Morning Glory and other thermal pools in Yellowstone.' Photographs from 1966 show the Upper Geyser Basin  pool's original blue colour, before the build up of coins and rubbish. The pool\u00a0received\u00a0its name in 1883 from Mrs McGowan, who was the wife of Assistant Park Superintendent, Charles McGowan. As a nod to its then crystal blue colour, she named it after the blue flower, Morning Glory. Although it was originally known by its Latin name, Convolutus, by 1889 it was commonly known by its current name. Over three million people enjoy the Yellowstone National Park annually,\u00a0spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles, comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and mountain ranges. Unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface, Morning Glory will never be fully blue again.

Mellor is accused of attacking Keenan through Twitter, emails and a blog, claiming she had fabricated an account of childhood sexual abuse in her bestselling memoir. The trial is expected to last about two weeks and is ongoing.", "article": "Penny Mellor, 53, (pictured arriving at Chelmsford Crown Court today) is accused of sending abuse online to anti-paedophile campaigner Shy Keenan. An anti-paedophile campaigner was bombarded with online messages claiming she lied in her bestselling misery memoir by a woman who had developed an 'obsession' with her, a court heard. Penny Mellor, 53, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, allegedly attacked Shy Keenan through Twitter, emails and a blog, claiming she had fabricated an account of childhood sexual abuse. Ms Keenan, from Colchester, Essex, who describes herself as a justice campaigner, wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. The revelation led to the conviction of Stanley Claridge and others in 2002 and Ms Keenan set up her own organisation, Phoenix Post, with campaigner Sara Payne, whose daughter was murdered. She also worked as a columnist for the Sun and revealed her early life on a BBC Newsnight programme. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Mellor accused Ms Keenan of repeatedly lying in her book, claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker. Mellor denies stalking Ms Keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between January 1 and 16 March 2013 by sending tweets, publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on Ms Keenan's day to day activities. Prosecutor Tony Abell, opening the case to the jury, said the law against cyber stalking via social media under which Mellor was being tried only came into effect in January 2013. He said Mellor appeared 'to have developed something of an obsession with Shy Keenan and embarked upon a very personal campaign against her'. He said the tweets were personal and offensive and continued: 'She has accused her repeatedly of lying in the book \"Broken\". 'She has suggested Ms Keenan has groomed individuals, implied that she\u00a0suffers from Munchausen's By Proxy and referred to her post traumatic stress disorder. 'Emails contain private information which Shy Keenan regards as sensitive, including copies of marriage certificates, addresses and the like.' Shy Keenan (pictured)\u00a0wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather. Mellor allegedly claimed that Ms Keenan'repeatedly lied' in her book. Mr Abell said Ms Keenan felt concerned about her own and her family's personal safety because the information might help other people with grudges against her. She had installed extra security and had had to go back on anti-depressants. The jury heard  Mellor was a campaigner against false allegations of Munchausen by Proxy, where parents were the victims of false claims from their own children, for organisation Dare to Care. In 1998 to 1999, Mellor and Ms Keenan were in close communication but they fell out. Ms Keenan thought that Mellor's work might be offering support to real child abusers. The two women didn't have any contact again until late 2012. Mr Abell said the trigger was Ms Keenan writing in her Sun column in October 2012, following the Jimmy Savile scandal, that she had mentioned to Esther Rantzen many years before of rumours about his inappropriate behaviour. Shy Keenan (right) with Dr Sara Payne (left), whose daughter was murdered by a paedophile, work together at her organisation, Phoenix Post. Mellor then began tweeting that Ms Keenan 'had told lies in her book Broken', said the prosecutor. Mellor emailed recipients including the BBC, Newsnight, the Sun, the Guardian, Broken's publisher Hodder & Stoughton and Ms Keenan's literary agent. She was appealing to them to 'investigate' her claims of inaccuracies in Broken and sent 239 tweets from January to March 2013. Mellor is to have accused Ms Keenan of 'lying and cheating for years' and that she 'cons everyone and hides behind that abuse'. The court heard she described the graphic abuse Ms Keenan wrote about in her\u00a0book as 'titillation' for paedophiles and not the sort of thing a mother should publish for her own children to read. Mellor wrote that Ms Keenan'seeks attention, she needs to be adored and revered in order to get money', the jury was told. 'That's a flavour of the sort of bile which was coming out of Penny Mellor over this period,' said Mr Abell.'It sought to attack Ms Keenan's credibility as a victim of sexual abuse, causing her distress and concern by revealing personal information. Mellor was given a verbal warning by Essex Police in December 2012 but after a brief respite, the cyber attacks began again in January. She was arrested on 15 March 2013 and told police her motive was to get Ms Keenan to stop what she was doing. The trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, continues. Sorry"}

Now a new study has found a link between testosterone and the caring side of men when they return home from the 'hunt'. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home. The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Pictured is a family who was involved in the study.\u00a0Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle. The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer. The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle which revolves around small, tight-knit communities that produce their own food. 'Our goal was to look at the interaction between different hormones in motivating behaviour in a naturalistic context,' said Adrian Jaeggi, co-lead author at University of California, Santa Barbara. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home.\u00a0The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer, and linked with changes in testosterone (pictured) 'Hunting for subsistence and sharing meat is something people have done for hundreds of thousands of years.' Previous studies have shown that oxytocin makes people more cooperative while testosterone has the opposite effect. Jaeggi said he expected to see a trade-off between the two hormones and was surprised to find the positive relationship between them. When a man tells his wife or girlfriend she looks nice, it\u2019s not because of her new haircut. Instead, it\u2019s his hormones doing the talking. A study found that a whiff of the \u2018love chemical\u2019 oxytocin made men rate their partners as being more attractive. And German researchers recently said that oxytocin may also play a key role in monogamy, a trait that is rare among mammals, other than ourselves. The University of Bonn scientists showed 40 young men who claimed to be passionately in love pictures of their partners. They were asked how attractive they found the women after being given a placebo spray to sniff and a burst of oxytocin. Pictures of strangers and of long-term acquaintances, such as work colleagues were also shown. The men, who were in long-term relationships, also underwent scans to check how much the brain areas responsible for rewarding feelings lit up. Lead author Dirk Scheele said: \u2018When the men received the oxytocin instead of placebo, the reward system in the brain was very active when viewing their partner and they perceived them as more attractive than other women. \u2018We did not detect this effect with pictures of long-standing acquaintances.\u2019 According to Jaeggi and co-lead author Ben Trumble, high testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a 'winner effect' experienced by men making a kill. It could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as the Tsimane. In either case, the increased oxytocin could serve as a balance to make the hunters kinder, more generous and more willing to share their bounty. 'Almost half a century ago, it was famously documented that successful Kung hunters were jokingly insulted by others in order to 'cool their hearts' to'make (them) gentle,' lest pride or boasting disrupt the egalitarian social system common to many foragers,' said senior co-author Michael Gurven. 'Here we observe a potential hormonal analogue consistent with the type of levelling behaviour seen in hunter-gatherer societies.' Another use for both hormones may have to do with post-hunt recovery. Both are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity. 'These men are coming home, they're finished with work for the day, and they're about to eat and share food,' Jaeggi continued. 'So the need to be social coincides with the need to regenerate and it would make sense for the same hormones to facilitate both functions.' To conduct the study, Trumble joined the hunters as they went out into the jungle and attempted to make a kill to feed their families. He then took saliva specimens along the way, collecting them at exact intervals. The oxytocin was measured in the UCSB Human Biodemography Laboratory. Though the sample size is 'not huge,' he and Jaeggi noted, the study 'definitely adds to the current literature in which the interplay between testosterone and oxytocin is often overlooked.'

Morgan Chase, General Electric, and Dow Chemical.", "article": "It was only after Ronald Read's death last June that his talent for picking successful stocks became public knowledge when he left $6 million to his local library and hospital in Brattleboro, Vermont. A former gas station employee and janitor in Vermont who died last June aged 92 had secretly amassed a fortune of around $8 million thanks to a hidden talent for picking successful stocks. Ronald Read's fortune only became public knowledge after his death when he bequeathed $6 million to his local library and hospital. During his lifetime Read was known to friends and neighbors as a man who sometimes held his coat together with safety pins and had a long-time habit of foraging for firewood. Read, who worked for almost 25 years at Haviland's service station in Brattleboro, was known for his flannel jacket and baseball cap. His most expensive possession was a 2007 Toyota Yaris valued at $5,000, which gave no hint of the size of his  fortune. 'If he could save a penny, he would,' Bridget Bokum, a senior associate at his local Wells Fargo Advisors office told WSJ. Bokum together with Claire Johns, the executor of Read's will, is currently going through a five-inch-thick stack of stock certificates to determine his exact worth. 'We all knew he was into the stock market, but not to this extent,' said Johns. The secret to Read's financial success was that a well as being a shrewd stock picker, he also displayed remarkable frugality and patience with his shares. At the time of his death Read owned at least 95 stocks, many of which he had held for decades. The secret to Read's success was that a well as being a good stock picker, he displayed remarkable frugality and patience with stocks including Procter & Gamble. He had invested across a variety of sectors, including railroads, utility companies, banks, health care, telecom and consumer products but had avoided technology stocks. When Read received dividend checks in the mail he plowed the money back into more shares, said Bokum. Among his longtime holdings were Procter & Gamble, J.P. Morgan Chase, General Electric and Dow Chemical. At the time of his death, Read also had large stakes in J.M. Smucker, CVS Health and Johnson & Johnson. His portfolio also included some notable failures including Lehman Brothers Holdings, which famously collapsed during the financial crisis in 2008. One of the keys for Read's success was that he was prepared to stick with his picks for long periods of time. In 1959 he bought 39 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric for about $2,380 and  they are now worth about $10,735.\u00a0At the time of his death, he owned 578 shares in PG&E, worth just over $26,500. When Read died last year he also had large stakes in companies including Johnson & Johnson. Secret millionaire in their midst: Ronald Read, (left, in his trademark baseball cap), pictured eating Christmas Dinner at the American Legion in Vermont a few years before his death. Stepson Phillip Brown, of Somersworth, New Hampshire, told the Brattleboro Reformer that the only indication Brown had of Read's investments was his regular reading of the Wall Street Journal. 'I was tremendously surprised,' Brown said of Read's hidden wealth. 'He was a hard worker, but I don't think anybody had an idea that he was a multi-millionaire.' Read relied on subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal and Barron's for his investment knowledge, although he also made good use of his local library to which he has  bequeathed $1.2 million. He also donated $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and made a number of smaller bequests. 'It's pretty incredible. This is not something that happens on a regular basis,' said the hospital's development director, Gina Pattison. Gas station employee: Ronald \u00a0Read worked at Haviland's service station for 25 years and even met his wife there in 1960 for whom he was married for 10 years until she died in 1970. This Google street view shows Ronald Read's modest home and that may even be him pictured in the right corner near his Toyota parked outside. Read was born in Dummerston in 1921. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, walking and hitchhiking about four miles each way from his home to the high school in Brattleboro. After military service during World War II, he returned to Brattleboro where he worked at a service station for 25 years then worked for 17 years as a janitor at the local J.C. Penney. In 1960 he married a woman he met at the service station but she died in 1970."}

'The cost per mile of HS2 is estimated to be up to nine times higher than the cost of constructing high speed lines in France.' The report by the economic affairs committee concludes the Government has many questions to answer on cost, benefit, reducing overcrowding and helping the regions. It adds: 'Parliament should not approve the enabling legislation that will allow HS2 work to begin until we have satisfactory answers to these key questions.' The first phase of HS2, from London to Birmingham, is due to open in 2026, with a second Y-shaped phase to Manchester and Leeds due for completion around 2032/33. The report says HS2 is supposed to rebalance the economy but it is London rather than the Midlands or the North that is likely to be the biggest beneficiary. Lord Hollick, chairman of the Lords committee, said: 'At \u00a350billion, HS2 will be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK but the Government have not yet made a convincing case for why it is necessary.

In a statement, it said: 'The case for HS2 is crystal clear. It will have a transformational effect, supporting growth in the North by improving connectivity, freeing up space on our crowded rail network, promoting regeneration, boosting local skills, generating tens of thousands of jobs and helping secure the UK's future prosperity.' On HS2's ability to relieve congestion, the peers said full information on passenger numbers had not been made available by the Government on grounds of commercial sensitivity. They said the target price for phase one of HS2 gives an average cost of around \u00a390million per kilometre. The French TGV network cost \u00a39.7million a kilometre."}

However, the teenager, who has a number of medical conditions and underwent facial surgery twice last year, had his application refused because of his high absence record. 'Last year he had a bit of time off because of his operations and other medical conditions,' said Daniel's mother Tracy, 48. Daniel Keyworth, 16, has been told he cannot sit his A-Levels at Wickersley Academy in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after missing too many lessons. But his mother, Tracy, pictured, said his low attendance was due to doctor's orders. 'When he's not well, I've always had him to the doctor. It's always been the doctor's advice. 'When they tell me to keep him off school, that's what I do.

He needed the same procedure revised in July, when cartilage from his ear was put in his nose. Daniel missed two weeks' school while recovering each time. His other complaints include Raynaud's phenomenon, which affects the blood supply to the fingers and toes, asthma, eczema and a list of allergies.

'He likes photography, graphics and science and he wants to do A-Levels after his exams. 'He's been getting there, slowly, and doing his best.' Tracy said Daniel's progress had also been hampered by the school losing coursework for graphics and photography. A Wickersley School spokeswoman said: 'We have no comment to make.' The septum is the structure that separates the right and left nostrils in the nose. It is made up of cartilage  at the front and bone further back. The septum is important in maintaining the shape of your nose. If the septum is bent or damaged it can cause a blockage or inflammation within the nose which can turn to mucus and a nasal drip. A septoplasty procedure involves operating inside the nose to straighten the septum. It involves a doctor exposing the bone or cartilage that is causing the blockage. The obstruction is then removed or straightened. Most patients who have the operation, which lasts between 30 minutes and an hour, are able to go home the same day. (source: NHS)"}

Naseer Chawki, who claims to be 34 and from Iran, was detained for more than four years while Home Office officials fought for deportation, after he was convicted of sexually abusing two women on a rush-hour Piccadilly Line train. But he has now won a High Court battle against Home Secretary Theresa May, after a judge ruled that he had been illegally held for seven months - against his human rights - during that process. Naseer Chawki, who sexually assaulted two women on a rush-hour Tube, could be awarded \u00a37,000 after the High Court (pictured) ruled he was unlawfully held for ten months while officials tried to deport him. Deputy High Court Judge Stephen Morris said Chawki's payout is yet to be assessed, giving no indication of what the figure would be. But according to human rights lawyers, the payout given to Chawki could be between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000. In 2013, a Supreme Court judgment set a precedent that those detained illegally should receive around \u00a31,000 for each month they are held against their human rights. It means Chawki can expect to receive around \u00a37,000. During today's hearing in London, the court heard how Chawki - who has failed in a bid to claim asylum - arrived in Cardiff from Iran in 1999 before moving to Liverpool. He then moved to Seven Sisters, north London. The court heard how, in November 2008, Chawki was given a three-year jail term for carrying out two sex assaults on the London Underground, as well as possessing a false identity document. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) had claimed Chawki was held because he posed a'serious risk' to the public but has lost the case. Chawki had pleaded guilty to the offences, after he pressed himself against the women on a crowded rush-hour train. The attacks had been witnessed by commuters and Chawki was later traced using DNA evidence and Oyster card records. During the hearing over those offences, the court heard how the 'revolting' sex attacks had had'very lasting effects' on the victims. Judge Martin Beddoe, who heard the case at Southwark Crown Court, said he would recommend deportation after he had served time in jail for the crimes. Chawki was then released from jail in December 2009. Following an order for his deportation, he was placed in immigration detention, while officials began the process. But he was released from immigration detention in March last year after attempts to deport him failed. He was made to wear a monitoring tag. After his release, Chawki launched a legal battle, claiming he had been held in immigration detention when then was 'no prospect' of him being deported. Mrs May disputed his claim, saying he posed a'serious risk of harm' and that there was a'serious risk' that he would abscond. Judge Morris ruled that detention had been lawful for the majority of the four years and four months Chawki was held. But he ruled that the detention had been unlawful between mid-September 2013 and March last year. He said that, by that time, there had been 'no sufficient prospect of removal within a reasonable time'. During the 2013 case which set the precedent on the issue of payouts, the Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of State had breached the human rights of Mr Faulkner by keeping him in detention for 10 months longer than necessary. Mr Faulkner was serving a life sentence but had brought the case over the delay in reviewing the need for his further detention, on the grounds of whether it was necessary for public protection. The Secretary of State was ordered to pay him \u00a310,000 in damages, setting a precedent of around \u00a31,000 in damages per month held unlawfully."}

A 22-year-old Saudi student was caught driving through Hyde Park in his father's custom made McLaren supercar, after he had been smoking cannabis in the early hours. Mohammad Al-Sharif was stopped by police as he drove through the London park and confessed to having taken drugs at 7.30am that morning, when officers found he was unsteady on his feet and slurring his words. The 22-year-old had been driving his father's limited edition McLaren car, which is worth around \u00a3168,500. The supercar, which goes from 0mph to 60mph in 2.8 seconds had been given a makeover to make it even more powerful. It was also a previous winner of 'best supercar' in\u00a0the Middle East's Car of the Year awards. Business student Al-Sharif, who lives off a family allowance, admitted driving while in unfit through drugs and was fined \u00a3400. He was also disqualified from driving for a year. Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard that he was stopped at about 10.40am on December 11 last year because he was seen driving 'erratically.' Mr Gill said:\u00a0'He was spoken to and there was a strong smell of cannabis coming from the car, he was the sole occupier. 'He was unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred when he spoke and he appeared intoxicated. 'He was asked if he had been smoking cannabis and said he had at 7.30 that morning. 'He was arrested and taken to Paddington Green Police Station and searched and a small amount of cannabis was found that he admitted was his.' A blood test found Al-Sharif had used cannabis and another drug, which is believed to have been prescription drugs. He was found to be driving on a Saudi Arabia-issued International Driving Licence, which ironically was not valid in his home country. Al-Sharif had been driving the supercar, which had been modified to make it even more powerful. Al-Sharif admitted having taken cannabis when he was stopped by police who spotted his 'erratic driving' The car, which belongs to his father, had been extensively modified to make it even more powerful. Al-Sharif denied the claim his driving was 'erratic', the court heard. He had been studying in London since 2012, attending Birkbeck College, the London School of Business and Finance to improve his English and career prospects in the finance sector. He has no income and survives with the financial support from his family in Saudi Arabia. Al-Sharif was spotted driving a McLaren MP4-12c 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8 Velocita Wind Edition. In the Middle East\u2019s Car of the Year awards the vehicle won \u2018Best Supercar\u2019 and overall \u2018Car of the Year\u2019 for 2012. The car was priced at \u00a3168,500 when launched onto the market in 2011. The Velocita Wind Edition was inspired by a mystery Saudi enthusiast, who demanded an alternative custom design to the McLaren MP4-12c. It can reach 60mph in just 2.8 seconds. Modifications included increasing the output from 592 hp and 442 lb/ft of torque to 660 hp and 502 lb/ft. It also includes a new spoiler lip for the front bumper and an added rear wing.

{"abstract": "North and sub-Saharan Africa have become a magnet for Islamist extremism, with countries such as Algeria, Libya, Mali, Niger, and Mauritania all experiencing terror attacks. The US, France, and other Western militaries have responded by creating military commands and training special forces in the region. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot, AQIM, has been responsible for many of the attacks, including kidnappings and suicide bombings.", "article": "(CNN)The attack on Tunisia's famed Bardo Museum is just the latest evidence that parts of North and sub-Saharan Africa have become a magnet for Islamist extremism. Tunisia -- lying just across the Mediterranean from Europe, but bordered on one side by Libya and on the other by Algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years. But it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of Islamist extremism has intensified in the region. Islamist terrorists also have struck in Algeria, where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013, and in Libya, where terrorists killed the U.S. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where ISIS has established a beachhead in the east. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has its roots in Algeria, has captured territory in Mali and taken hostages -- often Europeans -- in countries such as Niger and Mauritania. So what is the world doing about it? The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa. France has sent troops to Mali. And, as CNN recently reported from Chad, Western militaries have trained special forces from several northern African nations to take on the Islamists. Here's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how Islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of Africa. Algeria is home to a long-running Islamist insurgency. In perhaps the highest-profile incident, Islamist militants attacked the In Amenas oil and gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the remote facility. Dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege. The attack was the work of the Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the \"Signatories in Blood Brigade.\" Last September, another Islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, after seizing him as he walked in Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. Days earlier, the outfit -- Jund al Khilafa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Militants affiliated with AQIM had previously also kidnapped foreigners in Algeria, including Italians and Spaniards. In 2007, AQIM launched a suicide bombing campaign in Algeria, which included a deadly bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Algiers. In January, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. Besides its growing presence in Tripoli, ISIS is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Before the advent of ISIS, an Islamist group called Ansar al Shariah was blamed by the United States for carrying out the September 11,  2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. State Department computer expert Sean Smith and former U.S. Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, then acting as security contractors, also died. In 2012, Islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in Mali after a military coup and uprising by Tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. France intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the Islamists. Since then, Mali's government has battled various rebel factions, mostly in its northern region, with the help of French and African forces. Recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital, Bamako, which killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. AQIM issued a warning to France via jihadist websites in January, following terror attacks in Paris, stating that \"France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,\" citing the presence of its soldiers in Mali. According to analysis by Jane's Defence Weekly, despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward Libya, \"Mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with France and Algeria.\" Jihadist groups including AQIM and the Mulathameen Brigade operate in the porous border areas between Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya. Militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom, including three Spaniards in 2011, according to Jane's. However, since 2011 jihadist activity"}

Nathaniel Clyne may have to rein in some of his attacking instincts when playing for England, while Daniel Johnson was the star when Aston Villa's youngsters reached the quarter-finals of the NextGen series in 2012. Notts County are set to appoint Ricardo Moniz as their new manager following Shaun Derry's exit.", "article": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of international fixtures and reflects on a selection of interesting rumours from the Football League. 1. Ashley Williams was on Arsenal\u2019s radar for ages before signing a new four-year deal at Swansea last summer, but a move to the Emirates fell through supposedly because he wasn\u2019t considered Champions League quality. The 30-year-old has made a nonsense of that verdict since with his performances for Wales. Brilliant in a defiant defensive display when they gained a 0-0 draw away to Group B favourites Belgium in November, the Welsh captain was again outstanding in the 3-0 win in Israel which put Chris Coleman\u2019s side top of the group. While Gareth Bale grabbed the headlines, Williams was superb at the back. He gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes \u2013 and won it back both times. Ashley Williams (right, pictured with Gareth Bale) was in impressive form during Wales' win against Israel. 2. John Terry is clearly a far more decent bloke than the various unsavoury episodes of his past would suggest. At the age of 34 and with a back that needs constant treatment, Chelsea\u2019s captain could have done with a weekend off after playing all but four of Chelsea\u2019s 45 games so far this season. But he gave up his time to play 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard\u2019s All Star charity game supporting various good causes in the Merseyside area. Terry was also first to agree to play when Stiliyan Petrov ran out a sell-out game in Glasgow 18 months ago to raise funds for Leukaemia research. John Terry, pictured with Mario Balotelli, played 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard's All Star charity match. 3. Nathaniel Clyne might have to rein in some of the attacking instincts that have worked so well for him at Southampton when he\u2019s wearing an England shirt. The 23-year-old is beginning to look like a natural at right back for Roy Hodgson after winning his third cap in the 4-0 win over Lithuania. But Hodgson clearly asked Clyne to keep his position to let opposite full back Leighton Baines do most of the marauding forward. The Everton man played 53 passes in the forward half, nearly twice the number (28) that Clyne did. England ace Nathaniel Clyne may have to keep his position in order to let Leighton Baines maraud forward. 4. Portugal might have gone top of Group I with their 2-1 victory over Serbia but new boss Fernando Santos could do with finding some fresh talent for his squad. Seven of the side that started the game, including Cristiano Ronaldo, were already in their country\u2019s senior squad for Euro 2008. Portugal have failed to significantly freshen up their international squad since Euro 2008. 5. There must be something about the north London air because if Harry Kane can\u2019t stop scoring goals, the same is true of Olivier Giroud. Arsenal\u2019s centre forward, who has 11 goals from 13 starts for his club since the start of 2015, was on the scoresheet again for France as they beat Denmark 2-0 in a Sunday night friendly. Kane, certain to get his first full England start in Italy after his dramatic 79-second debut goal against Lithuania, has 14 from 14 starts for Spurs since New Year\u2019s Day. Harry Kane and Olivier Giroud flew the flag for north London by scoring for England and France respectively. 6. Andrew Robertson\u2019s return from injury could be a key in helping Hull battle away from the relegation zone in the last two months of the season. The 21-year-old left back, picked up from Dundee United last summer by Steve Bruce for a bargain \u00a32.8million, showed he is back to full match fitness with a dazzling display for Scotland. He played 100 passes in all during the win over Gibraltar, with 93 of them reaching a team-mate \u2013 and 49 of them in the attacking half of the field. Hull full back Andrew Roberton impressed against Gibraltar following his return to full match fitness. 7. Notts County say they are going to name a new manager this week with 50-year-old Dutchman Ricardo Moniz, once on Tottenham\u2019s coaching staff, the current bookies\u2019 favourite to get the job. They might be better off forgetting that and sticking with the experienced figure of Paul Hart who stepped up from working with the Academy for a one-off day as caretaker boss against relegation rivals Scunthorpe. The 61-year-old made a dramatic difference, lifting County out of the relegation zone with a 2-2 draw \u2013 and only a late Niall Canavan goal stopped him taking all three points. Notts County look set to appoint former Tottenham coach\u00a0Ricardo Moniz following\u00a0Shaun Derry's exit. 8. Midfielder Daniel Johnson was the big star when Aston Villa\u2019s youngsters reached the quarter-finals of the NextGen series in 2012"}

We in the UK cannot just watch as another country burns in the Middle East, strengthening the forces of extremist and violence. 'The Houthi rebels have brought the country to its knees. Yemen is facing an economic and humanitarian catastrophe. We are witnessing an implosion in one of the most strategically vital countries in the world.'

The lucha libre fighter, whose real name is Pedro Aguayo Ramirez, was left slumped against the ropes after a flying kick from one of his opponents, Rey Mysterio, during the match Friday night. The other wrestlers continued with the fight as Aguayo's limp body slid down onto the mat, according to video footage of the bout posted on social media. The video showed ringside personnel repeatedly shaking Aguayo and talking to him without any response. He eventually received medical attention and was rushed out of the arena in the city of Tijuana. But doctors were unable to revive him. AAA, the wrestling promotion company for which Aguayo worked, said it was informed of his death around 1 a.m. Saturday. He was 35 years old. \"Mexican lucha libre is in mourning over the death of one of its star talents,\" the AAA said in a statement. Questions remained over what exactly caused Aguayo's death and why it took so long for him to receive medical treatment. Ernesto Franco, the duty doctor at the fight, told Mexico's state news agency Notimex that at the time of Aguayo's collapse, he was attending to other injured wrestlers, according to CNN Mexico. Franco said Aguayo's injury was the result of a blow to the neck region, adding that he spent about an hour trying to revive him using \"all possible resuscitation measures.\" The Associated Press reported that the state prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into possible manslaughter. The AAA said Friday's fight was organized by another promotion company named The Crash. Aguayo's death prompted an outpouring of grief on social media from fans and members of the wrestling industry. \"I will miss you and carry you with me for the rest of my life,\" tweeted Rey Mysterio, who landed the flying kick on Aguayo. \"Rest in peace, Hijo del Perro.\" He posted two images on Instagram that appeared to show him and Aguayo at a young age and again later in life. \"I had the privilege to share a ring for the first time with Hijo del Perro Aguayo in his debut as a professional wrestler and an honor to be in the ring with this great legend for the last time!\" he wrote. \"You will be missed, Perro.\" WWE wrestler Mark Henry tweeted, \"Respect to fallen brother in arms!\" \"I and the WWE universe pray for your peace and comfort to your family!\" Henry wrote. Aguayo is the son of one of the giants of Mexican wrestling, Pedro \"Perro\" Aguayo. The younger Aguayo began his career in 1995 at the age 15, according to the AAA.

This comes as new figures reveal hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year. A 12-year-old boy has become the youngest person in Britain to have a gastric band fitted, as doctors struggle to fight the child obesity epidemic.", "article": "Teenagers as young as 16 in Birmingham have undergone weight loss surgery (file picture) Obese teenagers as young as 16 have had NHS-funded gastric band operations, worrying new figures show. And in a four-year period, the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in Birmingham more than doubled. Gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the NHS when a patient's life is deemed to be at risk. Such surgery is a last resort, and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally. The guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone. Meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go-ahead for surgery. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre released under the Freedom of Information Act show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. Overall between 2008-09 and 2011-12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase. It comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year. Since 2011, 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Last year it emerged that West Midlanders are the second fattest group in the whole country, with NHS England figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese. New figures released in January this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in Birmingham are  officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11. Concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an 'easy option' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle, eating more healthily and taking exercise. NHS guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has 'life threatening obesity' - a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, or a BMI of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. The policy states: 'It is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards. 'Due to these associated risks, most surgeons, whether they are working privately or for the NHS, would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not just for cosmetic reasons.' People can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately. A gastric band operation, which reduces the size of the stomach, costs up to \u00a38,000. Meanwhile, a full gastric bypass, which re-routes the digestive system meaning a person can digest much less food, costs around \u00a315,000. In the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery. which includes gastric bands abd bypasses. These included two 16 year olds, two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds. The NHS has warned that the treatment is available more cheaply overseas, but added it carries increased risks. Current statistics suggest that there is a one in 1,000 risk of death from weight loss surgery within 30 days. Nationally 16 teenagers under the age of 17 underwent stomach surgery in the last five years. Responding to figures revealing a rise in obese newborns,\u00a0Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions, which increase the size of the baby, most just overeat. He said: 'Quite simply, the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing. 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight. 'As they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is a continuous upwards spiral. 'Successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem. It starts at conception and sometimes even before then.' Mr Fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies. He said: 'Some babies are so fat they cannot come out naturally. 'Women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation. 'If we get it wrong, it's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on.' MailOnline has contacted NHS Midlands and East for comment.

Laurent Blanc\u2019s future as manager at PSG will hang in the balance, as will the competing philosophies at the respective clubs. In a battle of old money versus new money it\u2019s not often Roman Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea are consigned to the former category, the frugal, traditional team taking on the gaudy spendthrifts. Laurent Blanc's position as PSG manager is under threat despite domestic dominance in France. Branislav Ivanovic's crucial away goal has given Chelsea the edge in the tie ahead of Wednesday's game. But with Chelsea having grown out of their own age of extravagance, it is Qatari-backed PSG who have fallen foul of UEFA\u2019s new Financial Fair Play rules. When Jose Mourinho makes his barbed comments about clubs which \u2018think they can over-ride what Financial Fair Play says\u2019 he has PSG in his sights as much as Manchester City. And perhaps understandably so; despite being fined, like Manchester City, \u00a349 million for breaching the FFP rules, told by UEFA to break even by 2016, to not increase their wage bill and to limit transfers, the club managed to spend \u00a343m on Luiz. And, according to reports in France, the club\u2019s provisional budget for turnover next season has risen again to \u00a3350million after increased sponsorship deals with Nike, Emirates, Nivea, Huawei, Pure Essential and Mumm \u2013 all in addition to the disputed \u00a3150m four-year deal they have with the Qatar Tourist Authority, which UEFA refused to accept was a fair market price for a secondary sponsor. Jose Mourinho has complained about the Paris club's extensive spending, but FFP has had little impact. Former France defender Blance knows his bosses expect the team to progress beyond the last 16. PSG captain Thiago Silva has spoken of his desire for the club to challenge Europe's major powers. All of which leads the club to believe that their dream of winning the Champions League within the next few years can be achieved. \u2018I do not think the project here is stalling at all, it was always going to be a big project,\u2019 said Thiago Silva, captain and Luiz\u2019s defensive partner. \u2018The owners aim is to have us on the same level as Real Madrid and Bayern. We know that we have the players to be able to win the Champions League, and even with the very difficult game against Chelsea - we have to believe that this year can be our year.\u2019 That goal appeared a distinct possibility when Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side ran Barcelona close in the Champions League quarter finals in 2013, being knocked out on away goals. And when they beat Chelsea 3-1 at Parc de Princes in the first leg of the quarter final meeting last year, they appeared to be continuing their growth. But a 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge saw them ejected from the competition and they are now are in danger of exiting in the last 16. Silva praised the professionalism of his team-mate, and former Chelsea defender, David Luiz (right) Luiz was on the other side when the teams met in the quarter final last year, when Chelsea progressed. PSG will take heart from the first leg in Parc des Princes, where Chelsea were hanging on to the 1-1 draw by the end and the fact that last year PSG were missing an injured Ibrahimovich at Stamford Bridge. \u2018We are better equipped than last year to beat Chelsea,\u2019 said Thiago Silva. \u2018Even if you look at the game in Paris, we were the better team no doubt. If it was not for an unbelievable performance from their goalkeeper we would have won the game and would be travelling to London with the lead, we must take heart from that. \u2018David Luiz is very excited to go back to Chelsea. He had great memories there, he helped them to win the Champions League - so I would be very surprised if the Chelsea fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception. Javier Pastore looked to have given PSG a winning lead in the first leg last season, but Chelsea hit back. Demba Ba's last-gasp goal put Chelsea through, but PSG are confident they can win this time around. Lionel Messi scores against PSG in 2013, when it looked like the French side were on the brink of Europe's elite. 'He is a winner though, yes he has good memories of Chelsea, but his only objective will be to knock them out - and for us to progress.\u2019 Blanc\u2019s future remains uncertain.

The school and its president, David Boren, have opposed the lawsuit on procedural grounds, but the court has directed a lower-court judge to consider transferring the case to Oklahoma.", "article": "A federal appeals court has given new life to a Holocaust survivor's claim that the University of Oklahoma is unjustly harboring a Camille Pissarro painting that the Nazis stole from her father during World War II. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan has directed a lower-court judge to consider whether the lawsuit she threw out should be transferred to Oklahoma, saying she has authority to do so. The court's order on Thursday came as the school found itself amid a racial controversy after video of fraternity students engaged in a racist chant spread across the Internet. Dr. Leone-Noelle Meyer\u00a0maintained she is entitled to Pissarro's 1886 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' because it belonged to her father when it was taken by the Nazis as Germany moved across France. University President David Boren ordered a fraternity house closed and expelled two of its members after reviewing clips of the chant that referenced lynching and said blacks would never be allowed in the fraternity. The school and Boren are defendants in the lawsuit brought in 2013 by 75-year-old Holocaust survivor Leone Meyer, who lives in Paris. She maintained she is entitled to Pissarro's 1886 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' because it belonged to her father when it was taken by the Nazis as Germany moved across France. Her father, Raoul Mayer, died in 1970. Swiss records show Meyer's father in Paris had owned the painting. But a Swiss court ruled that the painting's post-war owners had properly established ownership and rejected her claim. Bequeathed to OU by Clara Weitzenhoffer, the wife of oil tycoon Aaron Weitzenhoffer, the school displayed it publicly for over a decade. The painting:\u00a0Swiss records show Leone-Noelle Meyer's father in Paris had owned the painting 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' by Camille Pissaro. Disputed item: This Monday, May 12, 2014 photo shows a display of information on the 1886 painting 'Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep' by Camille Pissarro. The Weitzenhoffers bought the painting from a New York gallery in 1956. When she died in 2000, she donated more than 30 works worth about $50 million to the University of Oklahoma. In an emailed statement Saturday, Oklahoma University spokeswoman Catherine F. Bishop said: 'The University is continuing its efforts to work with the plaintiffs to determine all the facts in this matter, some of which may still be unknown, and to seek a mutually agreeable resolution.' Last year, Boren defended Oklahoma University's ownership, saying the school does not want to keep any items it does not legitimately own but also wants to avoid a bad precedent by automatically giving away gifts it receives to anyone who claims them. Boren and the school have opposed the lawsuit on largely procedural grounds, saying the school has sovereign immunity and that Meyer was not diligent in pursuing her claim and had sued in New York rather than Oklahoma as a 'forum shopping strategy' to avoid Oklahoma's more restrictive statute of limitations. Several Oklahoma lawmakers who authored a resolution in the state Legislature seeking to force the school to turn the painting over have spoken out against the university's position. In a letter to the people of Oklahoma, Meyer has said her quest 'has nothing to do with money. It is about justice and a duty to remember.' Pierre Ciric, a lawyer for Meyer, said Saturday he welcomed 'any progress toward the resolution of our client's claim.' 'It appears that everyone involved with this case agrees that `La Bergere' was the property of my client's father prior to the Nazi occupation of France, which we have asserted since the complaint was filed,' he said.

Claire Dean, 43, noticed an insect bite on her hip while gardening in September last year, but thought nothing of it. A few days later she began suffering mysterious flu-like symptoms, and  soon found herself in crippling pain. A few days later she woke up with numb cheeks and noticed her face was paralysed - to the point where she looked unrecognisable  in the mirror. She was in such agony she had to quit her job as a cleaner and  was hospitalised for two weeks. Claire Dean, 43, was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a tick while gardening in September last year. She is pictured with daughter Alexandra, 21. Ms Dean remembers being bitten on her hip but thought nothing of it. Days later, she suffered flu-like symptoms which became worse until she was in agony. After carrying out tests, doctors discovered the mother-of-two had developed\u00a0Lyme disease,\u00a0a\u00a0bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. She was prescribed antibiotics and underwent months of physiotherapy to help strengthen the muscles in her face - and is now telling her story to warn others of the dangers of tick bites. On the day she was bitten she had been wearing jeans and a baggy jumper, which she believes the tick must have become caught in. Ms Dean, from Castle Douglas, Scotland, said: 'I was in agony. The bites themselves weren't itchy or painful, so I didn't think they were the cause at first. 'I'm quite an active person and just put the aches and sharp pains down to my body being worn out.' She began suffering flu like symptoms and went to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, when the pain in her hip and back became so severe she could hardly move. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. It is is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America. Public Health England estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad. Ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas that feed on the blood of mammals, including humans. Tick bites often go unnoticed and the tick can remain feeding for several days before dropping off. The longer the tick is in place, the higher the risk of it passing on the infection. Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire. They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. Lyme disease can cause problems with a person's skin, joints, heart and nervous system. It is treated with antibiotics. Source: NHS Choices. She was treated for pressure sores with codeine and paracetemol, before being sent home with crutches. The pain became increasingly worse, but she didn't want to burden her family and so tried not to complain. She said: 'I tried to hide the pain from my kids as I didn't want to worry them, but it was getting harder to put on a brave face' 'I had to quit my job as a cleaner as I just couldn't work, I was in that much pain. 'It got so bad, my daughter called an out-of-hours doctor who visited me and gave me a morphine injection for the pain.' Just days later, Ms Dean woke to find she'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks. She could barely open her mouth to speak and found smiling or wrinkling her nose impossible. Her GP performed a series of reflex test and diagnosed Bell's Palsy \u2013 a rare condition that causes temporary weakness of the facial muscles. There is no known cure for the condition, although most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after a few weeks. But six months on, Ms Dean's face was showing few signs of improvement. 'I was horrified that my face was paralysed, but even more so when my doctor told me that there's no cure,' Ms Dean said. 'I was told I could be paralysed for weeks, or even months. Only time would tell.' Ms Dean, who is a single mother to Alexandra, 21, and Carl, 12, was referred to hospital. She underwent blood tests and a lumbar punctures, which is where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system.

{"abstract": "This year, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East has kept tornadoes to historic lows so far. If we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during El Nino events, which is currently occurring.", "article": "(CNN)While Boston and other New England cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons, other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions. All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East remains stuck in more of a winter mode. \"We're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather, and the right ingredients -- moisture, instability and lift -- (have yet to come together),\" said Greg Carbin, the Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather. So far this year it's been extremely quiet. By this time in mid-March the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide. This year they have issued a paltry four. Both January and February were well below normal. March has been even quieter.  At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado. \"We are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather\" Carbin said. In fact if we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first, according to the center. There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March. This year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the United States the past several years.  In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253. Meteorologists don't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes, but one possible answer is the development of El Nino, a warming in the equatorial Pacific, which can influence weather patterns globally. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said that a weak El Nino had developed. So while all agree this is good news so far this year, it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet. Weather patterns can change quickly. In 1984, for instance, there was a very similar slow start through mid-March and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of June, according to data from the storm center. It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example. The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record. The twisters in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma, occurred in May of that year with devastating results. Tornadoes Fast Facts."}

After their daughter found their house ransacked and reported the Chumneys as missing, their bodies were found a badly-burned car the next day. Scroll down for video. Robert Clark, 29, was indicted by a grand jury in Coshocton County, Ohio, on 15 counts including murder. Jeffery Stewart, 21, was also indicted for his suspected role in the slayings of Doyle and Lillian\u00a0Chumney. Doyle, 88, and Lillian, 79, went missing from their home in Tuscarawas and their bodies were found a burned car. A Coshocton County grand jury indicted both of the men on 15 counts, including ten counts each of aggravated murder. Clark, who led authorities on a nationwide manhunt before being arrested on February 5 in Arizona, is facing the death penalty while Stewart is not, according to the Canton Times Reporter. His charges include death penalty specifications for using a gun which are not included in the charges against Stewart. If Stewart is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The jury felt the killings were premeditated and said Clark and Stewart caused the death of the Chumneys with 'prior calculation and design'. The other charges lodged against the men include aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, kidnapping and aggravated arson. Clark was also classified as a repeat violent offender because he was convicted of robbery in 2010. The men are being held separately in Tuscarawas County jail in New Philadelphia. They can plead guilty or not guilty when they appear in front of a judge, but an arraignment date has not been set. Clark is also suspected of being involved in the armed robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in West Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia."}
{"abstract": "England's 3-2 victory over Germany in the European Under 21 Championship showed that they can compete with the best of Europe. James Ward-Prowse, Carl Jenkinson and Nathan Redmond were the stand-out stars of the match, with Ward-Prowse scoring the winning goal. Gareth Southgate is still expected to include Harry Kane in the squad, but the performance of the three stars suggests that England can do well without him.", "article": "England's campaign at the European Under 21 Championship looks set to be dominated over whether Harry Kane is included - but Gareth Southgate may not need him. In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer. Southgate is still expected to do\u00a0everything\u00a0he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany\u00a0shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe. Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough. James Ward-Prowse. The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic. The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces. Germany's Julian Korb reaches out in vain as James Ward-Prowse fires home England's winning goal. The Under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance. In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game. Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on. Carl Jenkinson. Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home. But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side. Carl Jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for England as Germany substitute Nico Schulz looks on. Jenkinson put in a Man of the Match display having assisted two of England's three goals. It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal. With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team. Nathan Redmond. Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing. Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions. Nathan Redmond rifles home England's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner. Redmond celebrates after drawing England level late in the game following an impressive display on the right. It was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor Norwich side in the Premier League last season, but having struck the equaliser against a talented Germany team he looks to be improving. Now a veteran of the Under 21 set-up, it will be difficult for Southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for Kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the Young Lions."}

Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died that his father had started the fire on purpose. The inquest heard that Mr Sykes had felt the world was against him after a meeting with CAFCASS and had mistakenly believed his son only wanted to see him for one hour a week.", "article": "An horrifically burned 12-year-old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine-year-old brother, an inquest has heard. Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital. Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12. Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell. Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.' He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.' The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'. Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.' The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy. He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'. Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.' An inquest into the death of Paul (pictured bottom left and far right) and Jack was carried out today, where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing. Claire Throssell's son Jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother (pictured) at his bedside, but died five days later. He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss. Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.' CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week. Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.' She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.' Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father. The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had'meant the world' to her. 'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.' When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife. Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent \u00a3600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'. Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his"}

But instead of walking her son to the local school like most parents, she is forced to drive 25 miles to Archie's current school in Kings Hill, Kent. Louise Beard claims she spends \u00a3100 per school day - \u00a32,000 a month - on the school run after son Archie, four, did not get a place at a local school.

And at the end of the day, she has to do the entire journey in reverse, before picking them up from a childminder. She eventually gets the children home at around 8pm - 13 hours after they leave the house every morning. Mrs Beard said: 'It's awful at the moment. We are under a lot of stress. 'The kids are always sleeping in the car on the way. Archie is just exhausted.' The family estimate they spend around \u00a32,000 a month on the school run - or \u00a3100 per school day.

Total: Minimum spend of \u00a395 per day. Mrs Beard and recruitment manager husband Byron, 30, have already spent around \u00a312,000 on the school run since Archie started in September. They say they spend the money on petrol, train tickets, parking, a childminder, breakfast club and nursery fees. Now the couple are so fed up with the daily grind that they have decided they have no choice but to sell their \u00a3400,000 home and move closer to the school. A spokesman for Bromley Council refused to comment on the case specifically. The spokesman said: 'Bromley Council is responsible for ensuring that children applying for a Bromley school are offered a school place. 'In common with the rest of London we have had exceptionally high demand for reception places and have worked hard to provide all parents who applied on time with an optimal school place. 'The high demand means that proximity to school criteria may have a small radius, particularly in a year with large numbers of siblings. 'The pan-London admissions scheme distributes places in a scrupulously fair and transparent way based on the eligibility criteria including the applicant's permanent address and the number of places available at each school. 'Many schools are over-subscribed and cannot offer to all who apply, and only reach limited distances under the proximity criteria.' The family say they spend \u00a3100 a day on petrol, train tickets, parking, childminder, breakfast club and nursery."}

Now there\u2019s a host of exotic superfruits that are said to help reverse the skin\u2019s ageing process, boost energy levels and even fight disease. MANGOSTEEN. Native to South-East Asia, mangosteen is also known as the \u2018queen of fruit\u2019, because Queen Victoria offered a reward to anyone who could deliver some to her palace. Perhaps she\u2019d heard about its amazing health benefits, which range from healthy joints to improving the immune system. Mangosteen (pictured) is also known as the \u2018queen of fruit\u2019 and is native to South-East Asia. \u2018Mangosteen has been touted for its high content of xanthone compounds, which studies have shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties,\u2019 says Naomi Mead, lead nutritionist and founder of nutrition clinic Food First. Mangosteen is also good for acne, PMS and younger-looking skin. Buy your mangosteen in liquid form from Holland & Barrett (\u00a32.45) or Planet Organic (\u00a32.75), or order a bottle of capsules from biovea.com (\u00a317.20). PITAYA. More commonly known as dragon fruit, this is mild- tasting, but packs a powerful nutritional punch. Pitaya (pictured) is more commonly known as dragon fruit and although it's mild-tasting it has high nutritional values. \u2018Pitaya is rich in vitamin C, which has been repeatedly proven to protect against auto-immune diseases, heart problems and even the signs of ageing skin. It contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and improve cell function,\u2019 says Mead. Ocado stocks it in fresh (\u00a32.99) and tea (\u00a32.99) form. GAC. The spiky outer layer of this vine fruit might be poisonous, but the edible arils, or extra seeds, hidden inside are used across South-East Asia because of their fantastic red colour. Gac fruit (pictured) has a spikey outer layer which might be poisonous but the extra seeds inside are edible. The fruit contains huge amounts of beta-carotene and lycopene, known for their medicinal properties. \u2018Research has found the concentration of lycopene in gac to be around ten times higher than in tomatoes and carrots,\u2019 says Mead. \u2018Several studies, including research from the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at Portsmouth University, suggest lycopene helps protect against cancer of the lung, stomach and prostate.\u2019 Order gac, in powder form, for the princely sum of \u00a366.57 from Amazon. No one said every superfood comes cheap. SAW PALMETTO. The berries of this plant have been used in American Indian herbal medicine for hundreds of years \u2014 and for good reason. The fruit contains antioxidant compounds that can help in the treatment of an enlarged prostate gland or benign prostate hyperplasia. \u2018Clinical research has shown that taking one 320mg capsule of saw palmetto daily for two months before prostate surgery reduces blood loss, the development of problems during surgery and the total time spent in the hospital,\u2019 says Mead. Capsules available from Holland & Barrett (\u00a312.25) or Amazon (\u00a37.99). LUCUMA. \u2018Not only is it a good source of antioxidants, fibre, beta- carotene, niacin, potassium, zinc and iron, but the caramel taste makes it a healthy sugar alternative for diabetics and those avoiding refined sugar,\u2019 says Mead. Pick up this yellow Peruvian fruit at Planet Organic (\u00a36.99) or Whole Foods Market (\u00a37.42). PICHUBERRY. Another Peruvian export, this small berry  looks similar to a kumquat, but has a much higher vitamin content. Not only does it boast excellent levels of vitamin D, vital for healthy bones and skin, but it also contains vitamins C and B12. \u2018It has been shown to reduce inflammation as well as possessing anti-cancer properties,\u2019 says Mead. Pichuberry (pictured) is a Peruvian export and looks similar to a\u00a0kumquat but has a much higher vitamin content. Also known as Inca berries, green-fingered experts say they\u2019re hardy enough to be grown in Britain. Find them at biovea.net/uk (\u00a313.05) or suttons.co.uk (\u00a32.49 for seeds). ARONIA. All hail this North American berry, which has one of the highest antioxidant values recorded for a fruit. The deep purple berries, often called chokeberries due to their tart taste, are packed full of natural compounds that help protect cells from free radicals that cause ageing, degenerative diseases and cancer.

She then re-posted her post from that day, writing: 'I had my mind made up. My boyfriend was cheating on me. I have small kids, what will people think??

She says she had a difficult morning getting to the clinic as she had to find a babysitter because her daughter was ill, her car broke down on the drive and she arrived for her appointment late - and then she began to wonder if 'God was giving me signs to not do it.' Henderson explains that when she was called for her appointment she was looking in her wallet for her ID when a card fell out out - it had been left on a table by a couple she had served that week and had their church name on it. She says a verse from the bible which was written on the card gave her strength and then two of her best friends called and said they would support her. She writes: 'I told the lady I changed my mind. As I was about to walk out. A young girl no older than probably 19 says to me..\"Are you going to do it?\" I told her I couldn't.. She said..\"I wish I could be brave like you..\" I told her she was brave and she could do the same thing. 'She said she had to do it because of some serious circumstances.. As I turned around she said..\"When you see your baby's face for the first time you're gonna be so glad you walked out of here today.\" She says that when she left the clinic she felt an 'enormous amount of relief and strength.' Henderson said she had a scary pregnancy and admits to suffering weak moments but gave birth in September 2013.

Liverpool have now gone 13 games unbeaten since their loss to Manchester United in December, and have not conceded a goal in their last six away games, equaling the club record set in 1972. Henderson has stepped out of Steven Gerrard's shadow and has scored three goals in Liverpool's last three games.", "article": "After little more than an hour of a match that was proving difficult for Liverpool, Jordan Henderson removed the captain\u2019s armband from his left bicep and handed it to Steven Gerrard. He did so out of respect. He did so because he recognises that a player who only joined this contest as a second-half substitute remains arguably the finest to have represented the club. But four minutes after the exchange of that iconic piece of elastic came a moment when Gerrard might have felt it appropriate to hand it back. Jordan Henderson scored a second-half winner for Liverpool as they continued their impressive recent form. Henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved Liverpool within two points of the Premier League's top four. A delighted Henderson let out a roar for the Liverpool fans in the Liberty Stadium. Henderson's shot was deflected over the top of Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski's head and into the back of the net. Henderson was mobbed by his team-mates after scoring what proved to be the winner in Wales. Swansea: Fabianski 6, Naughton 6.5, Amat 7, Williams 7, Taylor 6.5, Ki 6 (Dyer 80), Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7, Gomis 7.5, Sigurdsson 7 (Emnes 89), Routledge 6 (Montero 73).

It was then, 68 minutes into this contest, that Henderson did something that has long been synonymous with Gerrard: he came to Liverpool\u2019s rescue. If it lacked finesse, and owed more to good fortune, a winning goal that narrowed the gap to Manchester United in the fierce battle for Champions League places owed everything to Henderson\u2019s desire and determination. It was an ugly goal, Jordi Amat\u2019s attempted clearance spinning off Henderson\u2019s shin and flying beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski. But it was Henderson who made the run in pursuit of Daniel Sturridge\u2019s flick-on and Henderson, after a stuttering first half, who had given Liverpool impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break. The goal was Henderson's third in the last three Premier League games after his strikes against Manchester City and Burnley. Liverpool recorded their fifth successive Premier League victory ahead of their huge clash against Manchester United on Sunday. Henderson clattered into Shelvey with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but Roger East opted not to even book him. If Gerrard had an impact, it was his deployment as a holding midfielder that allowed Henderson to get forward. And the fact the goal came so soon after Gerrard\u2019s first appearance in eight games reflected well, once again, on Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers deserves enormous credit for the run of results Liverpool are enjoying. It is now 13 games unbeaten since they lost at Old Trafford in December and six away from home in the league without conceding a goal, an achievement that equals the club record set by Emlyn Hughes and Co in 1972. Rodgers has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side. It has been tactically astute leadership. But Rodgers also needed players to step out of Gerrard\u2019s shadow and prove they can survive without him. Nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in Henderson now reflecting on three goals in Liverpool\u2019s last three games. The pressure was on here with Sunday\u2019s game against United at Anfield and a trip to Arsenal to follow. And against a Swansea side displaying a find blend of ambition and graft under the guidance of Garry Monk, Liverpool struggled in that opening 45 minutes. Monk might have been the managerial apprentice but Rodgers would have recognised how well Swansea\u2019s players had mastered their boss\u2019s instructions. They were excellent, using the pace and power of Bafetimbi Gomis to good effect. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet makes a full-stretch save to deny Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal in the first half. Liverpool's Belgian goalkeeper Mignolet had to make a number of important stops in the first half as Swansea piled on the pressure. Swansea midfielder Wayne Routledge evades a challenge"}

The 23 year-old (right) was always told by his agents not to divulge that he was gay because it would limit the variety of acting variety roles he would be offered. 'I was always told to keep my mouth shut - it was ridiculous,' he said. 'I was told only gay people played gay roles and straight people got all of the straight roles.

Although Harry doesn't play a gay character  - the theme of the movie was something that he could deeply relate to\u00a0as he felt'very shady and secretive'. The defining moment when Harry decided he could no longer live a lie was when he was directly asked if he was gay in a radio interview just after filming finished up just a year ago. 'I completely shut down and said something like \"that's personal\",' he said. 'Then I decided I couldn't keep living like that - I was lying to myself and not being who I am.'

Harry moved to Los Angeles a year ago to try to break into Hollywood which has made him notice that Australia still has a lot to learn when it comes to accepting homosexuals as equals in society. 'It's quite frightening how clear it is now that I have lived here - I knew it wasn't up to scratch with everybody else - I knew we were lacking a bit when it came to equality but I just didn't realise how bad it was,' he said. 'The U.S. has got 50 states and I think 37 now has got same sex marriage while none of them do in Australia - I think it's one of the last countries in the western world to be completely against it which I find very sad.'

Nigel Farage has launched an astonishing attack on the National Health Service accusing doctors of 'incompetence and negligence' over their failure to diagnose his cancer. The controversial politician developed cancer in his 20s and said an Indian doctor tried to convince him he had an infection even though his left testicle had swollen to the size of a rock hard lemon. The Ukip leader claimed he was 'fobbed off by one NHS doctor to the next', and, without private health insurance, he would 'probably be dead'. Writing in his memoir, The Purple Revolution, which is being serialised in the Telegraph, Farage wrote: 'Several doctors examined me - registrars, locums, all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that I had a twisted testicle. I would need an immediate operation, they said. I was taken by ambulance to hospital in Farnborough, Hampshire, where I was re-examined by another four doctors. It was pretty painful. 'An Indian doctor told me that the Bromley doctors had got it all wrong: I had an infection. I was to go home and take a heavy dose of antibiotics. I did not need an operation after all. A few weeks went by and the pain was just as bad. All the time, my left testicle was getting markedly larger.' Mr Farage said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his 'left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard'. But despite being in a 'terrible state' a consultant directed him to ''keep taking the antibiotics' and sent him away. Eventually Mr Farage said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer. Scroll down for video. After being told he was covered by company health insurance he went for private treatment and was swiftly informed he had a tumour and would need to have a testicle removed. Mr Farage told how he was 'terrified' when doctors told him he may have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs. More than 30 years on, recounting the period'makes  me upset', he added. On the day of the 2010 general election, Mr Farage said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70-year-old.d.

After the air accident Mr Farage was told that he could be  signed off as partially  disabled but having a blue badge would be'conceding  defeat'.'I remember thinking,'so this is it, this is how it ends',' he said of the air crash. 'When people say that their life flashed before them when they thought they were about to die, it is rubbish. 'All I could think of was how much there was I still wanted to do and the impact my death would have on others - my girls were still so little and the boys were only just finding their way in the world.' He added:'Having nearly died three times has made me a much bigger risk-taker. When you think your life is about to be taken away and you are given it back, you just want to get on and do things. 'There's no time to waste: children to bring up, elections to win, pheasants to pluck, wine to drink.' The Ukip leader accused other political parties of being afraid of criticising the NHS. He has also taken the opportunity in his memoir to attack the other major Westminster political parties over their fear of criticising the NHS. He said that he is 'better qualified to criticise and defend our health care system than most politicians'. Mr Farage praised the NHS for being 'astonishingly good' at emergency critical care but claims the NHS will 'probably let you down' over screening and a fast diagnosis. He said the system is'so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it' and warned that the NHS'is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks'. 'There are huge problems with the NHS, deep structural ones, but, as I have said, I know more than most what that means on a personal level,' he wrote. 'When I had cancer, the incompetence and negligence of the NHS almost killed me, but it has also saved my life. I am certainly not taking any flak from gutless politicians who claim that I am no fan or supporter of the NHS.'"}

Yussman had claimed two masked men ambushed him in his home and held him and his mother captive, ordering him to rob two Achieve Financial Credit Union branches. He failed part of a lie detector test while answering a question about his involvement in the home invasion, and the investigation is still ongoing.", "article": "Questions: Matthew Yussman failed part of a lie detector test after claiming he'd been held hostage. A credit union manager who told police he was held hostage, strapped with explosives and ordered to rob $4.2 million from the bank failed part of a lie detector test, it has emerged. Matthew Yussman, 46, had claimed two masked men ambushed him in his home in Bristol, Connecticut in the early hours of February 23 and held him and his mother captive. The next day, they ordered him to rob two Achieve Financial Credit Union branches, he said. He was ultimately found outside one of the banks with a device strapped to his chest, while his mother was discovered on her bed with another explosive beneath it. Both bombs turned out to be fake. Police previously said they had not determined if Yussman was a victim or a suspect but it has now emerged that he gave deceptive answers during a lie detector test the night of the attempted heist. He apparently lied while answering a question about his involvement in the home invasion, according to the Bristol Press, citing a search warrant for Yussman's home. New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said Yussman later withdrew from the test. 'He made the decision not to continue the interview a short time after,' Wardwell told the Press. The details emerged in search warrants secured this week for Yussman's home, car and laptop. Authorities previously took items, including his laptop and routers, and swabs from his home, and are investigating his cellphone and garbage bags taken from his car, among other items. The suspects reportedly ambushed Yussman in his garage as he returned home around 12.30am. Attempted heist: Police swarm around the Achieve Financial Credit Union in New Britain, Connecticut on February 23 after Yussman was found in the parking lot with a device strapped to his chest. Scare: Armored vehicles were seen on the scene before investigators learned the device would not go off. Yussman said two men stormed into his home that morning and took and his mother hostage. When his mother, who lives in an apartment on the side of the home, noticed he had failed to go inside, she checked on him and found him face-down with his hands zip-tied behind his back. Valerie Yussman, 70, told police that she saw the two 'well-spoken and polite' armed men in the garage and that they ordered her to stay on her bed. The men took Yussman from the home for 30 minutes around 3.30am after unplugging Mrs Yussman's phone, leaving her food and using duct tape to pin her to the bed. Her son told cops he was blindfolded and put in a car before they drove around for 30 minutes and returned to the house. It is not clear why they left the home. Valerie Yussman told police that she overheard the men saying they owed someone money and would kill the Yussmans unless they paid them. Her son and the men left later that morning after vacuuming a couple of rooms, she said. Around 8am, the bank's president called 911 and said Yussman had called him to explain his predicament, but told him not to call police. Minutes later, police found Yussman alone in his car outside the New Britain branch of the credit union and determined that the device on his chest was not going to detonate. Public works trucks were brought to the scene as'shields' because they would be large enough to withstand a blast or stop a car from fleeing if needed, Wardwell said. Probe: Yussman, the manager of a Achieve Financial Credit Union branch (pictured), remains under investigation and search warrants have been granted for his home, car and laptop this week. The suspects had disappeared by the time police arrived.\u00a0They are believed to have fled in a vehicle that looked like a white older model four-door Mazda, according to reports at the time. The incident sparked a massive police response involving dozens of officers and SWAT equipment. Schools were put on lockdown and roads were closed. Yussman was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where he was for exposure to freezing temperatures while having to sit in the unheated car. His mother was not hurt. The investigation is continuing. No arrests have yet been made but police previously said they were looking for two suspects.

This due to the\u00a0country's deteriorating security situation, as was witnessed on Friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country. A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings. What's more, hundreds of members of al Qaeda managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, the Houthis issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled President Hadi. Scroll down for videos. Yemenis and members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on Saturday in Yemen. Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on Saturday. CNN\u00a0reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among those who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and are now being sent out of the country. The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization\u00a0al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP, which is based in the country, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris. Members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of Friday's suicide bombings. Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The Houthis are a Shia group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup-d'etat that some believe was funded by Iran. In January of this year, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. It was at this point most Americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered. The Houthis also launched a strike against President Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital. That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi. This after President Hadi called the Houthis overtaking of the government 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy' in one of his first speeches in weeks. He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of\u00a0Riyadh, and no doubt upset the Houthis when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of\u00a0Sa'dah, the Houthi base. Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country. Hundreds of Yemenis chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings. Meanwhile, should ISIS indeed be behind Friday's attack, that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al Qaeda are both extremist Sunni groups, the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al Qaeda finding many ISIS acts and attacks far too extreme. Making ISIS's role in the bombings more likely is the January decree of al Qaeda senior leader Harith an-Nadhari who spoke against the shedding of 'unlawful blood,' such as attacks in mosques. The United States has said however they still cannot confirm who is behind the attacks."}

The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw, uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. It is significant because it suggests our first human ancestors emerged 400,000 years earlier than previously thought. The fossil is now encased in a glass box at the Arizona University. Scroll down for video. The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw (pictured), uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. The fossilised remains were put on display inside a glass case at Arizona University earlier this week. It was unveiled at a press conference by  Professor Kaye Reed, one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in January 2013. Scientists say the fossil, which is known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family. This would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - Homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Neanderthals. Researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve. 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon. 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge. 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early \u2018proto-human\u2019 shares traits with chimps and gorillas. 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's. 2.8 million years ago\u00a0- LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family. 2.7 million years ago\u00a0- Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing. 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa. 1.8 million years ago\u00a0- Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record. 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation. 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly. 400,000 years ago\u00a0- Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia. 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa. 40,0000 years ago\u00a0- Modern humans reach Europe. The discovery, which was found in the Ledi-Geraru area of Afar, has put a new date on the emergence of the first'man' from our more ape-like ancestors. Dr Brian Villmoare, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, helped lead the fossil hunters, said: 'In spite of a lot of searching, fossils on the Homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare. 'To have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage\u2019s evolution is particularly exciting. 'LD 350-1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million-year old Homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus. 'At 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved Homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features.' The researchers, whose work on the fossil is published in the journal Science, say the fossil could be a key missing link between the Homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called Australopithecus. Details of the Australopithecus are best known from a fossil named \u2018Lucy\u2019, dating back 3.2 million years, which was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. But exactly how Homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record. The new discovery has helped to fill that gap. Scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the Homo family from those belonging to Australopithecus. Until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils. Scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins. Dr William Kimbel, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University who was also involved in the research, said: 'The Ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between Australopithecus and early Homo. 'It\u2019s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution.'

A group of Rangers fans have been petitioning Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to ban the word 'H**' from football grounds. The group say the term incites'religious hatred' and is 'a derogatory and sectarian term for a Protestant'. There is no indication that Guidetti, who is on loan from Manchester City, had any idea of the meaning of the chant, but he caused anger nonetheless by saying he thought it was 'a good song'. A spokesman for the anti-sectarian charity Nil by Mouth told The Scotsman there was a need 'for a proper education programme for Scots footballers'. He added: 'Clubs should make it clear to them the kind of language likely to provoke others.' Guidetti was repeating a song that he had heard sung in the terraces while he played. Celtic manager Ronny Deila said recently he had not given up hope of signing Guidetti on a permanent basis."}

The team is Britain's last remaining representatives in the tournament and have been playing strong sides to keep their run going. Naismith hopes they can strike a balance between the Europa League and the Premier League to reach the final.", "article": "It still clearly rankles with Steven Naismith that injury saw him miss out on a UEFA Cup final appearance with Rangers in what now seems like another dimension, never mind seven short years ago. But the Scotland star has revealed that it\u2019s the memory of that heartbreaking episode which is spurring him on to reach this season\u2019s Europa League showpiece with Everton. Roberto Martinez\u2019s men host Dynamo Kiev tonight at Goodison Park in the first leg of their last-16 tie and the hosts are expected to progress against one of the competition\u2019s lowest-ranked sides. Steven Naismith consoles Kevin Thompson after Rangers' defeat in the 2008 UEFA Cup final. Naismith is determined to make up for that defeat, and missing the final, with Everton this season. Britain\u2019s last remaining representatives in the tournament will have their work cut out to go all the way, with the likes of Wolfsburg, Napoli, Roma and Zenit also still in contention. But Naismith is adamant they have what it takes to challenge for the club\u2019s second continental honour after the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup was claimed three decades ago - and are ready to go one step better than Rangers did in 2008 when they lost to Zenit St Petersburg in Manchester. In his first campaign at Ibrox after leaving Kilmarnock, Naismith appeared as a sub in a crucial 1-1 draw at Panathinaikos that gave Walter Smith\u2019s side an away goals victory. He was also among the replacements at Werder Bremen and in both meetings with Sporting Lisbon as the Scots kept progressing. But four days before the first semi-final with Fiorentina, he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in a last-four Scottish Cup tie with St Johnstone. Naismith, and his then manager Walter Smith, walk past the trophy in 2008. The Everton forward (far left) trains with his team-mates ahead of their tie against Dinamo kiev. That ended Naismith\u2019s quest for European glory. He was a spectator at the final and didn\u2019t play again competitively for another nine months. \u2018I played in Greece back then and was on the bench a couple of times afterwards but then I got injured at Hampden,\u2019 recalled the 28-year-old. \u2018I missed the semi-finals and the final and I remember watching the penalty shoot-out in Florence that took us through on TV and I didn\u2019t feel 100 per cent part of it. It was a great feeling to see the team win but I hadn\u2019t travelled and it wasn\u2019 t great to feel I was missing out. \u2018This is an opportunity to make up for that. There was still a great buzz from sitting watching the final from the sidelines in Manchester. It was fantastic but it also makes me think now I\u2019d love to get that feeling again and hopefully go one better, play in the final and win it. That\u2019s what drives me on. \u2018It\u2019s not just that I never got to play back then but also that I want to experience the feeling we had around the club from getting to the final in the first place. 'This season when we\u2019ve been playing in Europe, it has crossed my mind that the experiences I had with Rangers can help me, especially at this stage in the tournament. The disappointment of seven years ago, and his failure to influence it, still haunts the Scotland striker. \u2018We had to be very resilient and well organised in 2008. Teams found it difficult to break us down and we did well to counter and create chances that way. 'We rode our luck a bit as well and I look at that and think it was great we got so far. It\u2019s something Everton can look to do now too and we\u2019ve been similar. \u2018In the group stage, things went flawlessly and we played every game perfectly. We were very solid in the last round against Young Boys as well. 'As things go on, we know it will get tougher and tougher but at this stage we feel we can go further and go as far as the final. We definitely believe that.\u2019 While many English sides have looked upon the Europa League as a distraction from domestic matters in recent seasons, that hasn\u2019t been the case at Everton. Martinez has purposely picked strong sides to keep his team\u2019s run going, rather than sacrifice participation in the competition for the sake of concentrating more on the Premier League. Naismith wants to get his hands on the trophy he came so close to with his former club Rangers. That has impacted on the club\u2019s domestic performance and they lie 14th in the top flight - but hopes remain high they can strike a balance on both fronts. Naismith added: \u2018After working so hard last season and being so close to the top four in the league, this was our"}

A 25-year-old soldier in Lindenhurst, north of Chicago, was attempting to light a tracer round in his backyard with a blow torch when the ammunition exploded and alarmed residents on his street. Residents began calling 911 after their homes and windows began shaking from the blast at 9.45pm Saturday night. An Afghanistan reservist's bullet that exploded in a suburban neighborhood north of Chicago was a tracer round, which are often marked by a different colored tip from other ammunition (file photo) The reservist and his 23-year-old sister both received 'quite a few superficial wounds,' Lindenhurst police told the Chicago Tribune. They were released from the hospital Sunday morning and rejoined their parents, who treated their own small injuries. Tracer rounds contain a combustible compound that leaves a visible trail of the projectiles path. They can be taken out of their shells and ignited for use as flares, the likely intended outcome of Saturday's incident. 'What he thought would happen didn't,' Lindenhurst commander George Moravec said of the incident, which created a flash explosion. Moravec added that the reservist, who returned from Afghanistan last fall with the tracer, had a'respected history in the military'. Houses on the reservist's street (pictured) were shaken and police are assessing to see if there was any damage. Tracer rounds (pictured in Kobane, Syria, 2014) can be used as flares if removed from their shell and ignited. The exploding bullet was not illegal to own as a civilian and foul play is not expected. Police are going back to the residents to assess any damage done to property. Great Lakes Naval Air Station said they will conduct an investigation into the incident. An estimated $2million in damage was caused at an Indianapolis shooting range last year when a bullet believed to be a tracer round caused a fire, according to\u00a0WTHR.

Rohit was caught in the deep when he was on 90 but was allowed to keep batting when the umpires ruled that Rubel Hossain's delivery was above waist-height and therefore a no-ball, although television replays suggested it was a fair delivery. Rohit had initially been forced to abandon his normal cavalier approach as his team mates struggled to score quickly on a windy afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground but exploded later in the innings. While Suresh Raina (65) was the only other batsman to make a significant contribution at a rapid strike-rate, Rohit batted for 47 overs to make 137 off 126 balls, highlighted by 14 boundaries and three sixes. For a man who scored a world record 264 last year, it was almost sluggish going by his normal standards but no less crucial in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the World Cup. Of the three matches already played at the sprawling MCG during this tournament, the team batting first has scored over 300 runs and won each time and Bangladesh now face a formidable challenge to break that sequence. The MCG can be an intimidating bear-pit of a stadium and India opted to bat first in front of their fanatical supporters, and got off to a flying start, racing past 50 inside the first 10 overs. Bangladesh, appearing in their first World Cup quarter-final, managed to put the brakes on India's scoring after the fielding restrictions were lifted and they brought on their spinners. From the end of the 10th over till the start of the 35th over, India added just 104 runs for the loss of three wickets.

But cricket is a game where things can turn on the smallest of margins and India got two big breaks that proved decisive. Raina survived a confident appeal for lbw when he was on 10 then Rohit got a massive let-off 10 runs short of his century when he holed out at mid-wicket. The pair put on 122 for the fourth wicket as Bangladesh began to lose their way in the field. Raina threw his wicket away in the 44th over when he skied a catch behind then Rohit joined him after he was bowled by Taskin Ahmed but their efforts left India in a strong position to join South Africa as the second team in the semi-finals.

The product, called Palcohol, had received the greenlight from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error. On Wednesday, bureau spokesman Tom Hogue told The Associated Press the issues were resolved and that four varieties of Palcohol were approved. But Hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders. Dry booze: A brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The maker of Palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer. A few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above. The approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy. Several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol, including lawmakers in Colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale. That bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval. Concerns have included abuse by minors, the potential to snort the powder and whether Palcohol's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks. Palcohol would come in a pouch, with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink. A statement on Palcohol's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer. Palcohol founder Mark Phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early Wednesday morning, and said in a subsequent email that pricing hasn't yet been determined. 'We aren't commenting on production or distribution at this time,' he wrote. The four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan, a margarita, vodka and rum. Phillips added that he expects another Palcohol product \u2014 Lemon Drop \u2014 should also be 'approved shortly.' Previously, Phillips had said he came up with the idea for Palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles. Hogue said the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regularly reaches out to the Food and Drug Administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered 'adulterated.' If the FDA says the product isn't adulterated, he said the bureau's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what's in the product. 'Potential for abuse isn't grounds for us to deny a label,' Hogue said."}

Hernandez said Honduran judges would likely be in charge of the case because there has not yet been an extradition request from the United States. Since 2013, the U.S. government has identified Handal as a drug trafficking kingpin who supplied Colombian cocaine to Mexico's Sinaloa and rival Los Zetas cartels using clandestine airstrips as well as land-based routes into Guatemala, where the Mexican gangs have a presence. Handal's father and his wife were also designated as leaders of the organization by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"After several months of searching, today Chepe Handal has been detained and will now be judged,\" Hernandez said in a post on his Twitter page. Drug-related violence in Honduras has increased in recent years since Mexico's drug cartels expanded there, enlisting Honduran gangs and using its Caribbean coast to transport South American cocaine to consumers in the United States."}

The world champion was replying to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who called on the FIA to limit the superiority of Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes team to make the season a more even fight. Horner\u2019s view was supported on Monday by Bernie Ecclestone, the sport\u2019s commercial boss, who said: \u2018Red Bull are 100 per cent right. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian Grand Prix win after he finished ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg. The British Formula One star appeared in good spirits as he was pictured at Sydney Airport on Monday. \u2018There is a rule I think (former FIA president) Max Mosley put in that in the event of a particular team or engine supplier doing something magic, which Mercedes have done, the FIA can level up things. Mercedes have done a first-class job. We need to change things a little bit now. \u2018What we should have done was frozen the Mercedes engine and leave everybody else to do what they want so they could have caught up. We should support the FIA to make changes.\u2019 The indications  were that the FIA, the sport\u2019s rule-makers, will not rush to act on Ecclestone\u2019s words, which may have been intended primarily to soothe Red Bull, whose motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said they might walk away in light of rules that \u2018will kill the sport\u2019. Hamilton, celebrating his 34th career victory in Melbourne, detected an irony in Red Bull\u2019s criticism. Also on the podium was Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel who, as a Red Bull driver, won four consecutive championships from 2010. On Sunday it was third-placed Vettel\u2019s turn to finish more than half a minute behind Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

So I know how it must have felt back then.\u201d \u2018He had nobody behind pushing him. At least I\u2019ve got my team-mate, who I was really racing. I don\u2019t remember that ever being the case with Red Bull.\u2019 Ouch, even though Mark Webber did sometimes push Vettel, and not all of the German\u2019s championships were comfortable, with his first title coming down to a four-way decider in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton added: \u2018If you want to put someone in the same car, there is no doubt where I would be finishing. People say it\u2019s all the car. Well, it\u2019s a big team that built this car. I\u2019m the one who has to get in and extract the best from it. There has never been a driver that has won the championship that hasn\u2019t had a great car that year.

Horner's Red Bull have threatened to withdraw from the sport if changes are not implemented. Hamilton\u2019s views will be shared by those who believe Mercedes should be allowed to reap the rewards for their hard work, but Red Bull\u2019s Marko said: \u2018We will evaluate the situation again in the summer. If we are totally dissatisfied, we could contemplate an F1 exit. \u2018Yes, the danger is there that Mr Mateschitz (the owner) loses his passion for F1.\u2019 Meanwhile, Ecclestone has said Manor must pay for not putting out a car in Melbourne.

Distraught: Ms Hughes Dohm had released a heart-wrenching video (pictured) begging for the return of her  sons, whom she thought may have had their appearances altered by her former husband. Tarras missed a court date in August and police in Tennessee said at the time that he cut off an ankle monitor and fled town, investigators said. He was then listed as one of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's most wanted fugitives. He was tracked down after his cellphone was traced to Florida by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Marshals service, according to Sgt. Bobby Gibson with the Smyrna police department in Tennessee. He said the two were friends from growing up together in New Jersey. Prosecutors previously said Tarras had lured teen girls through an Internet ad seeking models to photograph. Tarras was appointed a public defender Thursday and was ordered held without bond in his first court appearance. Both men were jailed at the Pasco County Central Detention Center. Dohm also was being held without bond. Dohm's sons were reported missing by their mother February 9 after she said they weren't returned home by their father in violation of a custody agreement.

Instead however, he abducted Parker, who has asthma, and Jaxon and drove out of the state in his 2009 grey Nissan Pathfinder, swapping out his license plate with stolen plates along the way to avoid detection. Sandra released a heart-wrenching video begging for the return of her two sons earlier this week, noting that they may have had their appearances altered by Dohm, who suffers from diabetes.

Riley Rieser, 3, was tragically killed in a house fire on October 31, 2013, in Louisiana, Missouri. His family are now suing the city after the boy's stepfather, Ryan Miller, was tasered and handcuffed by police. Grandmother Lori Miller said she witnessed two officers use the stun gun three times, twice after Ryan Miller had been handcuffed. Mr Miller suffered chest burns and was taken to the city jail, although he was later released without being charged. City Administrator Bob Jenne called the police response a 'judgment call'. However the family say it was the wrong judgement, and are now suing on the grounds of\u00a0excessive, negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death and false imprisonment. The lawsuit was filed March 12 and was obtained by Courthouse News. The family are seeking unspecified damages. 'Officers Jeffrey Salois and William Harrison prevented Ryan Miller from entering the home to save his stepson Riley Rieser by forcibly moving and by repeatedly Tasing Ryan Miller, including once in the police cruiser as Riley Rieser was being removed from the home,' the lawsuit reads. Police used a stun gun three times on step-father Ryan Miller (left) and handcuffed him so he couldn't run into his burning home in an attempt to save young Riley (right) Riley Miller's aunt Emily has described the actions of the police as 'heartless' and she doesn't think they handled the situation correctly.

'It's just heartless. How could they be so heartless? And while they all just stood around and waited for the fire department, what kind of police officer wouldn't try and save a three-year-old burning in a house?' she told KHQA. 'We've been going through pictures and he's just smiling in every picture. He was just a happy, go-lucky kid.' The fire started in a recreation room at the rear of the house. The official cause was faulty wiring, according to the complaint. The parents had fallen asleep watching television, but were woken by the smoke alarm and managed to get out of the building via a rear door in the same room. They then called 911. Wreck: A city police officer fired his stun gun at Ryan Miller as he tried to re-enter his burning home, which was destroyed. Riley was asleep in his bedroom and so Ryan Miller ran to the front of the house and kicked in the front door. Police arrived as he was about to enter and an officer stunned him with a Taser. State Fire Marshal Investigator Scott. Stoneberger said that a firefighter in full gear attempted to enter the. home but the flames were too hot. Firefighters discovered Riley near the doorway to the bedroom from the front living room. Ryan Miller has another son who wasn't home at the time of the blaze."}

{"abstract": "Richard White, 63, attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray, and was shot by a sheriff's lieutenant. He was carrying a bag of Molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders. White had recently been described as very cordial and calm, and the motive for his attack is still unknown.", "article": "(CNN)The man who attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of Molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders, authorities said. The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report."}

Chai Jing's investigative documentary - which has already attracted unprecedented attention from the country's officials - explores the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells the story of her daughter, who was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The 39-year-old goes on to report how a number of newborn babies in China have contracted pneumonia without even leaving home. Scroll down for video. Young victims: Chai Jing, 39, has made a hard-hitting film, exploring the controversial topic of smog in China, one of the most widespread issues in the state. Motherly love: In the opening scene of the documentary, Ms Chai tells how her daughter was diagnosed with a benign tumour before her birth in October 2013. The film also features an interview with Wang Huiqin (pictured), 6, who lives in highly industrialised Shanxi Province and says she has never seen stars or blue skies. Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. It has already been watched by some 200million people and has sparked a firestorm of public criticism over the government's failure to act on the issue in a timely manner. In the 144-minute film, Ms Chai, a former anchor at China Central Television, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, tells how she made the documentary to tell her daughter 'what is smog, where smog comes from and what we shall do with it'. She explains how she found herself pregnant in January 2013, when 25 provinces and cities in China were blanketed by heavy smog. She then gave birth in October 2013, when her daughter had already been diagnosed with a benign tumour. The diagnosis led to Ms Chai quitting her job  at the beginning of last year so she could focus on taking care of her daughter. It was during that period that she began making the film, entitled Under the Dome, she explains. Enveloped: Most cities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai (pictured), face serious air pollution issues. Price for industrialisation: China burns a large amount of\u00a0petroleum and coal, two major causes of pollution. The film was distributed to various video websites in China on February 28. It received 117 million views in the first 24 hours, according to\u00a0Tencent. Ms Chai's daughter is no longer unwell. But she says in the film that she only took her daughter outside when air quality in Beijing was marked excellent or good. The rest of the time she had to lock her daughter at home 'like a prisoner', she claims. She adds that 175 days during 2014 were graded as polluted in Beijing. The film also includes an interview with a six-year-old girl, Wang Huiqin, who lives in Shanxi Province, a heavily industrialised area in central China. The girl tells Ms Chai in the interview how she has never seen stars, blue skies or white clouds in her life. Stardom: Ms Chai is a highly recognised anchor and investigative journalist in China. She is also a best-selling writer. Controversy: Although Ms Chai does not explicitly link her daughter's tumour to China's air pollution, the film - the first to probe the topic in such depth - has prompted public speculation that the two are connected. China's cities are often hit by heavy pollution \u2013 in the form of smog \u2013 caused by burning a large amount of petroleum and coal. The film has already been widely backed by the Chinese public, as well as a number of officials. Chen Jining, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection in China, was quoted in an article on People's Daily\u00a0as saying:\u00a0'I want to thank her. She has wakened up the public to pay attention to the environment from a public health perspective. 'I think (she is) worth our respect.' Self-protection: A girl puts a mask on her dog in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province, during a smog attack. Fake sunrise: An LED screen on the Tiananmen Square shows what a sun-rise looks like in heavily polluted Beijing. And Gao Mingyong, a senior media commentator in China, wrote on ifeng.com: 'Under the Dome is the best example of self-initiated media which can represent the logic of the internet, but its significance is far more than this.' Ms Chai financed the making of the film by herself which cost $160,000. It's believed that Ms Chai gave birth to her daughter in the U.S, leading to her being branded a hypocrite and traitor"}

Gregg Peers, who is standing for the Conservatives in a Cumbria County Council by-election two weeks before the general election, posted the fancy dress picture on his Facebook page. Labour MPs said it was'stomach churning' to see a prospective Tory councillor making light of a man who gunned down his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day two years ago. Gregg Peers, who is standing for the Conservatives in a Cumbria County Council by election two weeks before the general election, posted the fancy dress picture on his Facebook page. Mr Peers has previously stood for election in Newcastle and is the agent to the Tory parliamentary candidate for Barrow and Furness Simon Fell. A Conservative Party spokesman this afternoon attacked Mr Peers' fancy dress choice. He said: 'This is unacceptable and in poor taste. The candidate has apologised and taken the picture down.' But Labour shadow minister Liz Kendall said the Conservative Party needed to immediately discipline the candidate. She said: 'Oscar Pistorious is rightly serving time in prison for killing Reeva Steenkamp - it is stomach churning to see a man who wants to hold elected office making a joke out of the death of a woman. 'David Cameron must show he takes violence against women seriously by taking immediate action against his candidate, and the Conservatives must explain why they promoted him to senior positions in their party.' Oscar Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction. Former Olympian sprinter Oscar Pistorius posing with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2013 just a month before he shot and killed her. Pistorius is facing a fresh murder trial for the killing of his model girlfriend after prosecutors appealed against his manslaughter conviction. Prosecutors in South Africa want Pistorius convicted of murder for shooting his girlfriend multiple times in a bathroom in his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. Labour shadow minister Liz Kendal said David Cameron should sack Mr Peers. In December, Judge Thokozile Masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit Pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius's lawyers had argued that the judge should not have allowed that appeal. The Olympian and multiple Paralympic champion is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide, or negligent killing. The 28-year-old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital, Pretoria, in August to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. If prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the Supreme Court of Appeal and have it upgraded to murder, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail. Judge Masipa, who presided over Pistorius's seven-month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors, made her latest ruling after a short court session in Johannesburg. Pistorius's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits in the central city of Bloemfontein. No date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court, legal experts have said."}

Consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day, and the value of these sales fell by 4.8 per cent to \u00a3768m. The sector is now seeing its first TV advertising in 10 years, as well as a new Main Meals in Minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity Lucy Mecklenburgh.", "article": "After decades in the doldrums, eggs appear to have a cracking future. Consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled, scrambled and fried every day of the week. It is a remarkable resurgence for the egg, which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to \u2018Go to work on an egg\u2019. The revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein-rich diets such at Atkins and Paleo, which promise weight loss and even a longer life. Consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day. Experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein-rich diets including Atkins and Paleo. As a result, egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former Tory health minister Edwina Currie infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination. That attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs, which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol, which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries. However, the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit. At the same time, Vitamin D, which is vital for healthy bones, is up by 64 per cent compared to a decade ago. The net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body. Until 2009, Britons were warned against eating more than three eggs a week because of the worries about cholesterol \u2013 but this warning has now been junked. Research by experts at University of Surrey found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels. If you are looking for a loan, serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick. A compound found in eggs makes people much more generous, new research suggests. Scientists say that tryptophan, an amino acid found in some foods, can change our behaviour. In experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity. Eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel-good chemical serotonin. And the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines. It stated: \u2018Cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.\u2019 A spokesman for the British Egg Information Service said: \u2018Health professionals\u2019 recognition of their health benefits, and the end of the confusion over their effect on cholesterol, mean eggs are now being widely recommended as part of a healthy diet. \u2018They are also included in all major slimming plans, from established groups such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World, to more recent trends such as the Atkins and Paleo diets.\u2019 Egg consumption has also been boosted by the trend to eat breakfast at dinner under the rise of the \u2018Brinner\u2019 \u2013 a trend that has been imported from America. In total, 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year. \u2018Consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014, having grown 16 per cent in the past five years,\u2019 said the spokesman, adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s. The details were reported by Farmers Weekly, which said sales have also been helped by supermarket promotions and price cuts. Data obtained from retail analyst Kantar Worldpanel shows that, in the 52 weeks to the end of February, the GB retail market for eggs was up 2.4 per cent in volume terms. The egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit. However, the supermarket price cuts meant the actual value of these sales fell by a significant 4.8 per cent to \u00a3768m. Andrew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council, said he anticipated another year of rising consumption in 2015, pointing to the sector\u2019s first TV advertising in 10 years, as well as a new Main Meals in Minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity Lucy Mecklenburgh. A fan of the Brinner trend, she said: \u2018I\u2019ll often eat eggs for dinner when I get home from a work out in the evening. They"}

But Scully hoped that the journal he was writing would help explain his mental state and the motivations behind his actions.

Scroll down for videos. Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old. Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to a journal that he was now writing in prison and that the reasons for his horrific actions that he details in it could only be explained by a psychiatrist. 'What I'm looking for is the real reason why I took that road and what drove me to that, because in Australia I wasn't like that,' he said. However, for every direct question Ms Brown had, Scully had an equally opaque answer. 'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage. Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he said that he did, but could not say exactly when he felt this. 'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done,' he said. \u2018At what point do you have remorse? I can't answer that honestly yet.' When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Ms Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house. 'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown. 60 Minutes Tara Brown went behind bars in the Phillipines to speak to the alleged paedeophile. Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 13 children and causing the death of another. Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including\u00a0Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie. She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.

Here's how we split the clubs:. South. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom,\u00a0West Ham United. North. Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland. North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England. But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point \u2013 football. This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win? In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East. And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event? Yesterday, Rob Draper selected his South XI. Here, Joe Bernstein reveals his North XI - plus seven subs. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager. And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... Goalkeeper: Joe Hart (Manchester City) Tough call between David de Gea and Hart, but the City stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air. And, as he showed against Lionel Messi, he can stop a penalty too. Right back: Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle United) Been outstanding this season and Toon fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up. Janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard. Creative player too. Centre half: Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City) Would surely have been an England regular if he played for a more glamorous club than Stoke. Better than Gary Cahill or Phil Jagielka, less injury-prone than Phil Jones. This team is so crammed with attacking talent, the two centre-halves are in purely to defend. And they're good at that. Joe Hart has been superb in the league and showed against Barcelona he can do it in Europe too. Daryl Janmaat has been outstanding this season and Newcastle fans will have an anxious wait this summer. Ryan Shawcross pictured scoring for Stoke City against Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium. Centre half: Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) Totally fearless, he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre-half. Useful in both penalty areas at set-pieces too, he gets his fair share of goals for a defender. Him and Shawcross wouldn't let anything pass, allowing the two full backs to push up. Left back: Leighton Baines (Everton) Just gets better and better with age. Fantastic at set-pieces, both delivery and shooting, and so calm on the ball. Has got over the disappointment of not joining Manchester United and it's no coincidence Everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured. Right wing: Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Showed at the last World Cup he has now taken over Wayne Rooney's mantle as the best player in the England team and it's hard to believe he is still only 20. The one player in Roy Hodgson's squad that you think could actually make it with Real Madrid or Barcelona, he is quick, skilful, has natural balance and courage on and off the ball. Liverpool's totally fearless defender Martin Skrtel (right) squares up to David de Gea at Anfield recently. Everton's Leighton Baines just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding Premier League. Raheem Sterling has become an brilliant performer for Liverpool this season as they look to tie him down. Central midfield: Michael Carrick (Manchester United) People ask why Manchester United's form has improved in the last couple of matches. Simple, Michael Carrick is back from injury and making the team tick. Always seems to know when to play the right pass, and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great. Central midfield: James McCarthy (Everton) If this team has steel down the middle in Skrtel and Shawcross, and stealth in Carrick, McCarthy adds speed. He can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball, the Irishman is neat and tidy. One of Roberto Martinez's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him. Left midfield: David Silva (Manchester City) With Leighton Baines behind him, Silva wouldn't have to hug"}

House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration. McConnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue. When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no. The final bill provides funding for one more week, at which point Congress needs to take up the issue again. Yet from a different perspective, congressional Republicans are achieving their goal. Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems. While the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough. Using up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against. The strategy has been pretty straightforward. Each time that President Obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation, whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality, Republicans have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy. This is what Republicans did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if Democrats did not accede to their budget demands. Congress spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default. This was all that anyone in Washington was talking about. The GOP did the same with the threat of a government shutdown. Even though the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act is remote, Republicans keep bringing it up for a debate, forcing Democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing. The \"tea party\" faction of the House Republicans has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week. Since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles, and that they won't allow Boehner to rein them in for \"practical\" political considerations, Democrats can't afford to take the threats lightly. Republican leaders can and have said to the White House they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems, but with a nod to the Republican caucus, remind Obama that they don't have full control. While it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the GOP and place Republican presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016, many congressional Republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar. Aside from vetoing bills, President Obama doesn't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away. Now the GOP has done it again. Even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security, months have been consumed on Capitol Hill. When the year began President Obama wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year. He wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor, as well as the struggles facing middle class Americans. But he has only had limited success. Instead, he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill. When House Republicans pushed their \"stop-gap\" measure to fund Homeland Security for just another week, they were following the standard game plan. By avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems, and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time, the GOP continues to eat away at the president's political clock. Usually political extremism does not have the virtues that Sen. Barry Goldwater claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the Republican Convention, but it sure can have short-term political benefits in Congress. Just ask Mitch McConnell, who can barely contain his grin."}
{"abstract": "Prince William is visiting China for the first time in three decades, and his visit is being viewed as a test of his diplomatic skills. Chinese people have been embracing British culture with a passion, from watching British TV shows to sending their children to British schools. Prince William will be visiting the Forbidden City, attending the Chinese premiere of the British-produced children's movie \"Paddington\", and launching a campaign to celebrate British innovation during his three-day trip.", "article": "(CNN)Prince William arrived in Beijing on Sunday -- the first visit to China by a senior member of the British Royal Family in  three decades -- and he might have been expecting a dose of culture shock. But chances are he'll feel right at home. From television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock Tudor housing developments, China has been embracing British culture with a passion. Chinese viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like \"Sherlock Holmes\" and \"Downton Abbey,\" with the former's star, Benedict Cumberbatch, so popular he has his own Chinese nickname -- Curly Blessing. The fascination with Edwardian England depicted in Downton has created a growing demand for butlers, and the country's elite are donning tweeds and taking up deer stalking. \"Downton Abbey depicts traditional British, high-class lives. It something that I and many other Chinese are curious about,\" said student Cherrie Zhang. It's not just television shows. Affluent Chinese parents are sending their children to British schools after some of the most notable names in British education have established campuses in China. Harrow, Wellington College and Dulwich College have all opened sister schools in the country. And the obsession with British culture has taken a bizarre turn in Thames Town, a housing development on the outskirts of Shanghai that resembles a quaint English town, complete with replica red telephone booths. It's crucial that Prince William capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high-profile visit, which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills. \"It will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne,\" said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney and a former British diplomat. \"And I think China will put some capital in his visit because this guy is not a politician, who come and go, but (someone who) will be around for quite a while.\" Cultural exports are viewed as a growth area that the prince can promote. China spent 17 million pounds on UK TV programs and formats in 2013, a 40% increase on the year before, but they form a small part of the overall trade balance. And while London has been successful in attracting Chinese investment, UK companies have not thrived in China the same way as some of their U.S. and German counterparts. Previous trips by Royals have been gaffe ridden. When the Queen and Prince Philip spent time in China in 1986, the Queen's husband caused offense when he told a group of British students: \"If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed.\" Prince Charles, William's father, has never visited China but described the country's leaders as \"appalling old waxworks\" during his visit to Hong Kong in 1997. His close ties with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, have also angered China's leaders. Prince William will visit Beijing's Forbidden City, attend the Chinese premiere of the British-produced children's animated movie \"Paddington\" in Shanghai and launch a campaign to celebrate British innovation during the three-day trip. Before China, he is spending three days in Japan. The prince will also get a chance to champion one of his favorite causes -- combating the illegal trade in wildlife --  when he visits an elephant sanctuary in southwestern China. \"If he can make some kind of link in China, if he can instinctively show he gets it, that could be an important thing,\" Brown said. But the relationship between the UK and China comes laden with \"stacks of historic baggage,\" Brown adds, and the prince will have to tread carefully, particularly over the former colony of Hong Kong, where the push for a free vote has strained ties between Britain and China, the current landlords. British lawmakers were denied permission to visit the city on a \"fact-finding\" mission last year amid heated pro-democracy protests. What's more, it's not clear how much \"star power\" Prince William has in China, especially without his glamorous wife Kate, who at eight months pregnant won't make the trip, and his young son George. An informal survey conducted by the UK's Telegraph newspaper in Beijing showed that many struggled to recognize the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- one thought the couple were in the movie \"Titanic\" -- and there are fears his visit will struggle to attract interest among ordinary Chinese. \"The Royal Family are not really a big deal to me,\" said Zhang, the Downton Abbey fan. Serena Dong in Beijing contributed to this report."}

Only seven others could ever make that claim: Fangio, Brabham, Piquet, Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Vettel. Here in sunlit Melbourne, Hamilton began practice for the Australian Grand Prix at the start of a 20-round season in which the British driver hopes to add his name to that exclusive club. Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to retain the Formula One title after last season's triumph. Hamilton took part in Friday's Formula One Grand Prix practice session ahead of Sunday's season opener.

My second choice: Daniil Kvyat of Red Bull. The race I am most looking forward to? The saying in F1 is those that start with \u2018M\u2019 are the best to be at: Melbourne (my absolute favourite), Monte Carlo, Montreal and Monza. Mexico returns this year. Hamilton pondered the word \u2018legend\u2019 and said: \u2018I hope when I have retired and am much, much older, perhaps in 30 years, a kid might use that phrase for me. \u2018I want to win this year. There\u2019s a championship there for the taking. Damn it, I want to win it! I want to go and grab it. More than ever. At least as much as last year, and hopefully even more.\u2019 He will certainly have a car capable of accomplishing that task. Mercedes are in a parallel universe of speed and reliability, according to pre-season testing. It again promises to be a straight fight between him and his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lauda is their boss at Mercedes. Stewart has been a critic of Hamilton from time to time. He thinks the word \u2018legend\u2019 can only be applied long after a driver has hung up his helmet. \u2018That is how it works with many halls of fame in America,\u2019 he said. \u2018Time waits to confer its judgment.\u2019 The debate about Hamilton is always keen. He fuels this by his actions. He has taken to posting pictures of himself brooding and pouting, half-dressed and self-absorbed on the photo-based website Instagram.

More than a dozen state institutions have 'adopted' a stray dog, which is then issued with an official state identity card bearing its photograph name and where it lives. Five of the dogs live at Old Havana's Museum of Metalwork and regularly patrol the streets after hours. When not patrolling, each of the dogs can be found sleeping underneath the institution's grand stairway. Vladimir the former street dog now lives at the Old Havana Museum of Metalwork in Havana, Cuba. Each of the street dogs is given an official identity badge with its photograph and contact details. Security Guards Dary Valdes, left, and Margarita Garcia, right, enjoy looking after their unusual colleagues. The dogs, Vladimir, Canela, Aparicio, Leon and Carinoso spend the days avoiding the hot Caribbean sun among the museum's artworks. All of the dogs afforded the special status are immune from the attentions of Havana's dog catcher. Yarisbel Perez, who works in one of the historic buildings in Plaza Vieja, in the centre of the old city, said: 'I don't like dogs but I've really developed a soft spot in my heart for them.' Ms Perez and her colleagues are responsible for two dogs, Nina and P9, who is named after a bus line in the city. Ms Perez feed her dogs half-eaten pork chips and left-over chicken and rice from a nearby restaurant. Ordinarily, all animals are banned from workplaces in Cuba with the exemption of guard dogs. Nora Garcia, President of the Cuban Association for the Protection of Plants and Animals said the dogs were afforded their special status after a guard was awoken one night by a barking dog who noticed some people were looking to steal an air conditioning unit. Guard Yarisbel Perez said she did not initially like the dogs but has since developed a soft spot for them. The dogs are afforded special protection from Havana's dog catcher because of their security role. Leon, Canela, Vladimir and Aparicio pictured are four of the five dogs at the metalwoork museum. Ms Garcia said: 'There was a public ceremony in which the dog received an award for saving the air conditioners.' Some security guards adopt the dogs to alleviate the boredom of protecting buildings in a city with little crime. Victoria Pacheco, who works in the metalwork museum said: 'They don't eat bones. They eat cold cuts, mincemeat, hotdogs and liver.' The animal protection society maintains a list of 21 dogs living in state institutions, including a Communist Party gas station, offices of the Cuban Journalists' Union and a mechanical workshop of the Ministry of Public Health. Dalia Garcia, caretaker of a public toilet has taken responsibility for two of the dogs. 'They stay here and nothing happens to them. Everyone takes care of them, no one hits them. They don't bark and they don't bite anyone.' Each of the dogs is provided with free healthcare and accommodation by the state institutions invovled. Dogs without the special name tag face being detained by the dog catcher and possibly destroyed. Other dogs haven't been so lucky, including a group snatched by the dogcatcher from Havana's University of Arts while their student protectors were home on vacation, Garcia said. 'They're official for us but the state doesn't always look so kindly on them,' she said. 'When they come and say there can't be any dogs here, they have to go.' Similarly sad fates await street dogs who aren't chosen for special treatment by state workers, including some of the dogs who wander, matted and skinny, through groups of quasi-official dogs on the streets of Old Havana. 'Sometimes we feel bad and we give them something to eat,' Perez said. 'But if we start taking care of all of them, it would get to be a zoo around here.'"}

It's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Whether Athena's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum is another matter entirely. Following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media, the All England Lawn Tennis Club was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition. Earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket, alongside the famous image, to promote its Powerful Posters exhibition, due to open tomorrow. That such a saucy shot should appear to have won the approval of the historic and respectable club immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma was outraged, writing: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who call themselves 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The offending image was swiftly deleted from the official Wimbledon Twitter account and a new post went up which said: 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it.' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition. However, a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Last night an All England Club spokesman said the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over 2million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. One Twitter user said: 'Come on Wimble!

Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for \u2013 I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.' The year-long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum's collection, an 1893 advertisement for The Championships, through to the original artwork for this year's Grand Slam at the world famous venue in London SW19."}

Giuliani has stood by his comments, but wrote an op-ed saying he didn't intend to question Obama's motives or the content of his heart.", "article": "Facebook has removed the personal account of a 12-year-old Georgia boy who posted a viral video last week in support of Rudy Giuliani's comments that President Obama 'doesn't love America'. Republican C.J.Pearson found out the price of his new found fame on Friday morning when a friend told him it had been deactivated for'suspicious activity'. Fearing his video, which was watched by more than 1.4 million people, may have been the cause, Pearson hit out at the social media giant, accusing them of quelling any dissent towards Obama. Dumped: C. J. Pearson (seen here in a picture from his public page on Facebook) had his personal page deactivated after the social media giant became aware of his age. The first sign that something had gone awry came on Friday morning when Pearson informed his followers on his public page he had lost his personal account. 'I am having my Editor, Alan Davidson post on my behalf on this page while Facebook continues to lock me out,' wrote the Columbia Middle School student according to\u00a0Fox. 'The 1st amendment is obviously not a big concern to the powers that be at Facebook, but we will continue to fight back!' Demanding a response from Facebook, they duly replied and gave him a cast-iron reason why they banned his page - he is 12. Indeed, it is explicitly stated in Facebook's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account. Drawing attention to yourself:\u00a0CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a viral video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's love for America. In a statement, Facebook said they were alerted to the fact that Pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly. 'You have to be 13 to have a Facebook account. This is a requirement, not a suggestion. He was locked out because he lied about his age, not because of the content,' replied a Facebook representative. Pearson however, is not having that. 'I would consider that complete malarkey,' said Pearson to Fox DC. 'Because in all honesty, there are many many people younger than me who have a Facebook account.' 'I will not stop here,' he added to FOX 5. 'You cannot silence a voice that deserves to be heard. And I will continue to make as many accounts as possible.' Pearson made a number of media appearances over the weekend to draw attention to his plight. 'Time and time again, Facebook has shut down many conservative accounts after they decide to speak up,' Pearson said on Fox & Friends Sunday. Defense: Giuliani wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he didn't want to question Obama's motives or heart. Attacked: Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that President Barack Obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should. 'When a person decides to speak up, their voice shouldn\u2019t be hindered because of someone disagreeing.' Last week, Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America at a fundraising dinner for Governor Scott Walker, but he found a backer in Pearson. He told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - that 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.' Democrats, the White House, and even members of the GOP have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician, who was a Presidential contender in 2008. After the tide of criticism, middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video agreeing with Giuliani, in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'. The video, posted last Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 1.4m views as of Monday night. A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'. For his part, Giuliani has said that he stands by his controversial comments made last month. However, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he 'didn\u2019t intend to question President Obama\u2019s motives or the content of his heart'."}

While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene.\u00a0Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the\u00a0White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I\u2019m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State. Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth \u2026 we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-gr"}

A Maryland woman who stood by while her husband horrifically whipped, shook and kicked his grandson to death has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors say Melissa Dawn Brittle, 38, of Thurmont, Maryland, encouraged husband Raymond Brittle to punish two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins - who was staying with the Brittles and their three children at the time. Robert died in a Washington, DC, hospital on September 8, 2013 following injuries that State's Attorney Charlie Smith called the most horrific he has ever seen, according to the Frederick News-Post. Mrs Brittle waited until the next day to take the unconscious boy to the hospital. She told police that Robert had fallen down the stairs. Mrs Brittle's lawyer argued that she was terrified of her emotionally abusive husband and intimidated into covering up his violence against little Robert. Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh told Daily Mail Online that Brittle had no job, no high school diploma and no driver's license. 'We adamantly denied that she encouraged the child in any way,' Mrs Drawbaugh said. Raymond Brittle has admitted to horrifically beating two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins to death in September 2013. The Brittles were looking after the boy for his mother. 'She did come clean and cooperated with police and did facilitate a call to her husband in which he confessed to the crime.' Drawbaugh asked for a 12-year sentence, the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for the case, arguing that Mrs Brittle helped bring about her husband's guilty plea and had been prepared to testify against him. Mrs Brittle faced up to 40 years in prison under a state law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse. A judge on Wednesday ordered her held for 20 years, with 20 years suspended. Robert Dean Watkins was the step-grandson of Raymond Brittle. Raymond and Melissa has agreed to take care of the child for his mother. Raymond Brittle has also pleaded guilty in the child abuse case and faces 55 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. Prosecutors say he routinely beat and battered Robert while he was caring for his grandchild. On September 5, he became enraged at the boy when he wouldn't eat dinner. He whipped the children with a belt and kicked him. Investigators say he also lifted the boy by his head and shook him. An autopsy found that most of the boy's body was covered with bruises. He also had a fracture that covered three quarter of his skull and the injuries caused his brain to shift."}

Hill House Independent Junior School in Kensington in west London was rated 'inadequate' in every single category by Ofsted inspectors and its fate will now be decided by ministers who will review the report. An inspection of the exclusive  school, where alumni include Prince Charles and singer Lily Allen, criticised it for breaching health and safety measures as well as failing to ensure its young students make adequate progress. Hill House Independent Junior School was rated 'inadequate' in every single category by Ofsted inspectors. The former prep school attended by Prince Charles (pictured centre, introducing his mother, Queen Elizabeth to teachers) could be closed after Ofsted inspectors rated it 'inadequate' in all five areas. Hill House was also criticised for focusing on getting older pupils to practice entry tests for secondary schools at the expense of teaching them in depth about their subjects. The family run school, which is based at several houses in Kensington and Chelsea, has previously been described as 'eccentric' in the Good Schools Guide. It has almost 1,000 pupils who attend from the age of four to 11. The Department for Education said the next stage in the process is for ministers to review the report. A spokesman said 'all options' remained open, despite the school's independent status. This includes closure or helping leaders come up with an action plan to improve. Lily Allen is among the school's famous alumni. Among the criticisms leveled at the school by inspectors, who visited at the beginning of December last year, was the poor educational attainment by pupils. The report said: 'Too few pupils make adequate progress across the school, particularly in writing and mathematics. 'Leaders and proprietors do not have the capacity to secure essential improvements. They are not taking any action to secure effective teaching.\u00a0They do not know if pupils are making the progress of which they are capable.' Behaviour and safety of pupils also achieved a blistering 'inadequate' rating by inspectors. While pupils were regarded as polite with 'excellent manners' and generally good behaviour, their safety was raised as a concern. Inspectors highlighted poor attention paid to health and safety. It said 'The safety of pupils and adults is compromised on some of the school sites. The report branded fire evacuation procedures 'flawed', with records lacking detail and staff lacking training to deal with problems. It said the supervision of children was sometimes 'lax' and some fire exits could be a hazard. Ofsted inspectors rated the school as 'inadequate' in each of the five categories of leadership and management; behaviour and safety of pupils; quality of teaching; achievement of pupils; early years provision. The prep school was ranked as inadequate in all five areas that were inspected by Ofsted in December. A spokesman from the Department for Education said: 'We have just received a copy of Ofsted's published report following an inspection at Hill House International Junior School. 'Ministers are studying that report and will confirm their decisions about regulatory action shortly.

The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere. The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass.

But when Richard and Sara from Newport think of their nine-year-old son Toby's future, they see prison. The schoolboy, who features in a new programme tonight on Channel 5 called My Violent Child, has suffered from bouts of extreme violence since he was very young - even at the age of four he threatened his older brother, then five, with a knife. Scroll down for video. Sara and Richard from Newport are struggling to control their nine year old son Toby, who suffers from violent outburtss. Despite still not reaching double figures, he has already been in trouble with the police for causing permanent damage to a fellow child's mouth after hitting them with a brick. His father Richard said: 'From a very young age he was very aggressive. When he was about four, he held a knife to Casey and threw bricks at Casey.' He continued: 'We've had police at the house where he's thrown brick - a child ended up injured and needing dental treatment. 'I expect for Toby in his teens to be locked up, we're expecting that. Because he doesn't care.' Sara comforts Toby after one of his outbursts. The couple, who have three other children; Casey, 10, Corey, seven, and Jacob, four, have been unable to control Toby's behaviour for years because they have no idea what the root of the problem is or what will start him off. Sara said: 'Absolutely anything sets Toby off, it can be anything as daft as two items of food touching on his plate, a noise, a smell or something he sees - it can be anything. 'He's physically abusive, he's mentally abusive, he really gets to you - to the point that he makes me want to cry sometimes. 'Sometimes I just let him pinch me and hit me and then he'll calm down and sometimes he does. 'I don't want to live on edge every day when he wakes up, I should be able to enjoy being his mum.' Toby attacks his mother during a tantrum. Sara and her son Casey try to get Toby off a bike during one of his outbursts. The brunt of Toby's behaviour is borne by his parents - Richard and Sara have both been strangled by their son and during the hour-long programme, he is regularly filmed punching, biting and kicking them both. But the violence also extends to his brothers, including four-year-old Jacob, who is filmed being kicked by Toby in the park. His nature has become so unpredictable that Sara reveals she is worried about leaving them alone in a room. Sara reveals that she often just allows Toby to kick and punch her to calm him down. Sara said: 'I can't leave him with his brothers because I know he'll hit them.' The strain has become so great on Sara and Richard that it has almost split them up several times. Richard said: 'It has driven us to the point where we could have parted ways many times. 'When there's no more you can do for each other and we're struggling, it gets to the point where it would be easier to turn and walk away.' In an effort to find out what is causing Toby's outbursts, the programme makers call in parenting expert Sarah Evans. Following a discussion with Sara, she discovers that the very early years of his life were fraught with stress from the family's living situation. From left: Father Richard, Casey, 10, Toby, nine, Corey, seven, Jacob, four, and Sara. Sara and Richard had their eldest child Casey when Sara was just 14 years old, then 10 months later she gave birth to her second son Toby. Because of the strain of having two children so close together, Sara reveals that she was very stressed and admits that she didn't bond with Toby as well as she would have hoped. Sarah Evans then talks the family through a series of tricks that she can use to enforce the bond between mother and son and explains that much of Toby's behaviour may be down to the lack of affection. Sara attempts a bonding exercise with Toby. As Sara starts to use tactile behaviour, including hugging Toby when he is having a tantrum or lightly touching his hand, she sees that her son starts to come out of his tantrums much quicker. Sarah also discusses the importance of Richard spending time with his family. Richard works long hours six days a week in a car business in order to provide for his family, but Jane emphasises that his children also need him to be around at home. The family then spend a day at the farm together and the couple admit that they are beginning to see big improvements in their son. Sara said: 'It is early days but I hope that if I persevere with it then we'll get results down the line and I think that day will come.' My Violent Child airs on Channel 5 this Wednesday at 9pm."}

Lance Hohaia  scores first try for\u00c2\u00a0of St Helens on Friday night. Widnes led at the break thanks to tries from Eamon O'Carroll and Patrick Ah Van in front of 7,772 fans. The hosts were missing skipper Kevin Brown, Cameron Phelps, Lloyd White, Manase Manuokafoa and Hep Cahill with Danny Craven, Stefan Marsh, Grant Gore and Macgraff Leuluai back after last week's defeat at Huddersfield. St Helens, without James Roby and banned Kyle Amor, were strengthened by the return of Burns from suspension, while Paul Wellens reverted to his old full-back spot in the absence of injured Jonny Lomax. Josh Jones and Andre Savelio replaced injured Mark Percival and Mark Flanagan, who were also injured in the win at Wakefield with Luke Walsh still missing. Widnes notched their first home win over Saints for 20 years last season and made a flying start with O'Carroll charging over from short range after Danny Tickle was held short. Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook has the ball stripped from him by the tackle from Stefan Marsh of Widnes. Tickle had no problem with the straightforward conversion to fire his side into a 6-0 lead. Alex Walmsley almost forced his way over for Saints but was bundled into touch by determined tackling. The Vikings defence was not as impressive after 15 minutes with Hohaia scampering over from dummy half, with Burns adding the goal to level at 6-6. Saints continued to pile on the pressure before Widnes were only denied on the break by a try saving tackle from Tommy Makinson on Joe Mellor before a thundering midfield burst by Ah Van. Makinson was forced to quit injured with Widnes regaining the lead with Rhys Hanbury's pass putting Ah Van over in the corner and Marsh booting the touchline conversion with Tickle having gone off. Marsh struck a penalty five minutes before the interval to make it 14-6 and Saints could have no complaints after sloppy handling. Jon Wilkin gives thumbs up to Saints fans at the end of the game. Paddy Flynn failed to collect the restart and Widnes paid the price with Ah Van fumbling a Jon Wilkin kick - Vea pounced and Burns converted to cut the gap to 14-12. The Vikings lost Chris Dean with a rib injury and were forced to drop out twice in quick succession from under their own posts as Saints stepped up the tempo. The pressure told with teenage forward Thompson forcing his way over to give Saints the lead for the first time after 53 minutes with Burns' kick edging them ahead 18-14. Saints put daylight between the sides four minutes later after a thundering burst from Vea with Wellens in support to send Turner over and make it 24-14. Hohaia wriggled over for his second try to add to the Vikings' woes on the hour and stretch the lead to 30-14. Danny Craven looked certain to notch a third try for Widnes after a long range break but stumbled and was stopped by Matt Dawson. Widnes managed a late try from Aaron Heremaia but paid the price for their poor start to the second half. \u00c2."}

It will take four years to destroy the Pueblo stockpile. Another 523 tons of mustard and deadly nerve agents are stored at Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky. Blue Grass isn't expected to start destroying its weapons until 2016 or 2017, finishing in 2023. The destruction process is safe, officials said. Most of Pueblo's stockpile will be dismantled and neutralised in a highly automated $4.5 billion plant built at the depot. The Pueblo Chemical Depot \u00a0in southern Colorado has a method of destroying damaged chemical shells. The United States said it never used mustard agent in any conflict and agreed to destroy their stockpile. About 1,400 damaged shells and a dozen metal bottles of mustard agent are considered unsuitable for that plant. They'll be opened with explosives and neutralised in the sealed chamber, which sits inside an airtight structure near the larger automated plant. The metal bottles contain mustard that was extracted from the shells for testing. A single bottle was the first container to be opened and neutralised Wednesday. Crews were waiting for the neutralisation to finish before draining the chamber, rinsing it and then removing the remains of the bottle. Once all the bottles are destroyed, crews will start work on the damaged shells, depot spokesman Thomas Schultz said. The automated plant isn't expected to begin work until December or January. Design and construction have taken years, and final testing and training are underway. Mustard agent is a thick liquid, not a gas as commonly believed. It has no color and almost no odor, but it got its name because impurities made early versions smell like mustard. The U.S. acquired 30,600 tons of mustard and nerve agents, but it never used them in war. Nearly 90 per cent of its original stockpile has already been destroyed, mostly by incineration. The depots in Colorado and Kentucky are using chemical neutralisation because residents and officials expressed concerns about the vapor from incineration."}

Cookbook author Dreena Burton, 44, stopped eating meat, fish and animal products 20 years and during that time, has written five best-selling cookbooks. The Vancouver-based author's most recent, Plant-Powered Families, includes more than 100 whole-food, vegan recipes  to help families that want to transition to a meat-free diet. Scroll down for video. Cookbook author, Dreena Burton stopped eating meat, fish and animal products 20 years ago and in that period has written five best-selling cookbooks. Dreena's recipe for Cinnamon French Toast omits eggs and instead uses white chia seeds, cashews and unsweetened dairy-free milk. Dreena, who writes a blog as well, has raised her three young children (ages 6, 14 and 10) as vegans, and the recipes supposedly cater to everyone from fussy eaters to packing school launches. The 'delicious, creative, fun and nutritious' book also includes guides to healthy and balanced meal plans for all ages, including a morning snack, an afternoon snack and even a dessert after dinner. Burton highlights key superfoods such as quinoa and kale, and flags easy ways to incorporate them into an everyday diet. She also underlines more unconventional food alternatives, such as using vegetables like artichoke in place of meat in a burger patty and use sunflower seeds to change up the texture. Instead of meat-based burger patties, Dreena uses artichokes for the body of the'meat' Dreena then uses sunflower seeds to change up the texture of the artichoke burger. The mother-of-three also recreates iconic American meals with vegan alternatives, such as the'sloppy joe', which is usually comprised of beef. onions and ketchup in a bun. Burton instead, utilises oats, green lentils and red bell peppers. When it comes to desserts, the recipes become truly inventive, with brownies that omit eggs and instead use kidney beans, dates and a potato. Dreena became a vegan in her twenties and at first made subtle dietary changes. 'I wanted to improve my health. I began learning about the health benefits of a plant-based diet (and the health risks associated with consumption of animal products). Scroll down for recipe. Dreena's recipe for her 'Crazy Brownie' excludes the use of eggs and instead opts for slightly unconventional ingredients such as kidney beans, pitted dates and cooked yellow or red potato. Dreena's three daughters (pictured left to right - ages 6, 14 and 10) are also vegans. Dreena has said: 'I didn't want to give our children foods that I didn't want to eat myself!' 'After making some changes over a period of weeks, I first became vegetarian, and then vegan a few months after. 'I felt so much better, and all beneficial aspects of the diet (health, environment, animal welfare) connected for me.' Her cookbook also includes healthy drinks options such as the pumpkin pie smoothie. As well as a variety of seasonings, she also incorporates pumpkin pur\u00e9e, mango chunks, pitted dates and banana slices - all blended up. Her breakfast options include  delicious cinnamon french toast, which omits the use of eggs for ingredients such as white chia seeds, cashews and unsweetened dairy milk. Scroll down for recipe. In the recipe book\u00a0Plant-Powered Families, Dreena makes meat-less alternatives to burger patties by substituting beef or chicken for artichokes. Dreena believes that all the beneficial aspects of being a vegan, including health, environment and animal welfare added up for her. As for her three children, raising them as vegan was ever the only option. Dreena says: 'It was very natural for me. I didn't want to give our children foods that I didn't want to eat myself! 'As a new parent, I was of course cautious and did my research. 'But ultimately, I wanted to give our children abundantly nutritious foods, and protect them from the health risks of meat and dairy consumption.' Dreena only uses simple and natural ingredients such as pumpkin to create her whole-food, vegan recipes. Dreena cooks delicious vegan dishes with her 6-year-old daughter. She says: 'Ultimately, I wanted to give our children abundantly nutritious foods.' It turns out Dreena's strong belief and extensive list of recipes have attracted attention from high-reaching places.

Some lawmakers are upset that lethal weapons haven't already been included as part of $75 million in new aid announced Wednesday. Asked during a White House press briefing to confirm that the U.S. won't send weapons to the former Soviet nation, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'That's not necessarily accurate.' 'I can't,' he said. 'The President, I think, in his own mind, is continuing to evaluate the situation in eastern Ukraine,' Earnest told reporters, 'and continuing to assess the risk that's associated with providing additional lethal assistance to the Ukrainian military.' Scroll down for video. STILL ON THE TABLE: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the Obama administration hasn't ruled out sending lethal military aid to Ukraine. BROKEN DOWN: Ukraine's military vehicles are being repaired with COINS where bullet-holes have made them otherwise unfit for new duties on the front lines. NEW COSTS? Russian President Vladimiar Putin has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula. Obama is weighing the consequences of putting new lethal weapons in the hands of Ukraine's military, weighing the risks that it could further inflame a conflict in which more than 6,000 people have already lost their lives. 'That bloodshed is something that we're trying to avoid and de-escalate,' Earnest said. 'So the president is very mindful of the potential risk that's associated with providing additional lethal military assistance to the Ukrainians.' Members of Congress from both parties have repeatedly urged Obama to provide Ukrainian soldiers with lethal weapons to defend themselves. Cory Fritz, spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, told the Associated Press that the new aid 'will be completely ineffective.' 'The Ukrainians are begging for help, and the Congress is begging the administration to provide the defensive lethal assistance we authorized in December. Our allies deserve better,' Fritz said. CHEWING IT OVER: Obama, seen Tuesday in Atlanta, Georgia, is said to be mulling the geopolitical pros and cons of standing up to Putin by sending new defensive weapons to Kiev. DEVASTATION:  Pro-Russian rebels last week inspected the rubble of a destroyed coal mine that was used as a Ukrainian army outpost. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of 13 lawmakers wrote on Tuesday to Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran and Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top dogs on the Appropriations Committee, asking them to set aside funds specifically for 'defensive weapons' earmarked for Ukraine. 'While these weapons would not allow Ukraine to outmatch the Russian military, they would enable Ukraine to better defend itself and increase the costs of President Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine,' they wrote. 'By increasing costs for President Putin\u2019s aggression, it would discourage future aggression in eastern Europe that could even more directly threaten U.S. national security interests.' Another pair of senators, Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, reached across the aisle to jointly demand that the White House green-light new weapons allocations. 'Now is the time for the United States to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself from continued Russian aggression,' the wrote in a letter to the president. 'We should not be misled by Vladimir Putin's repeated efforts to exploit nominal ceasefire agreements.' Putin, the president of Russia, has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula. Corker and Menendez said in their letter that providing defensive weapons to Ukraine could 'impose a greater military cost on Russia' for its aggressive movements. 'After countless broken promises by the Kremlin, it is clear that Moscow's aggression in Ukraine can only be stopped if Putin realizes that the United States and Europe are unequivocally committed to helping Kiev impose this military cost on Russia,' they insisted. HANGING ON BY A PRAYER:  Father Alexandr Matveev led his congregation in servcies held in his office on March 8; their Russian Orthodox church's main hall was destroyed by Russian shelling in 2014. APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED: US senators from both sides of the political aisle want the White House to send weapons to Ukrainian soldiers, and they're willing to spend taxpayer dollars to do it. Word of Wednesday's new aid package came in a telephone call Wednesday from Vice President Joe Biden to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The White House said Biden also expressed concern that Russian-backed separatists are violating cease-fire agreements in eastern Ukraine and keeping out international monitors. Earnest said the new aid includes unmanned drones to help defend Ukrainian forces and enhance their communication; radios and other secure communications equipment; radars to warn and protect against mortar and artillery fire; and medical equipment, including military ambulances.

King then tweeted Friday how much he paid the state in taxes over the last two years. The entire tax controversy stems from a plan being considered by the governor of Maine to overhaul tax.

Busch was accused by Patricia Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against the wall in his motor home at Dover International Speedway in September. \"After a thorough consideration of all of the available information about the case, it is determined that the admissible evidence and available witnesses would likely be insufficient to meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Busch committed a crime during the September 26th incident,\" Delaware Department of Justice public information officer Carl Kanefsky said in a statement. \"Likelihood of meeting that high burden of proof is the standard for prosecutors in bringing a case. For this reason, the Department of Justice will not pursue criminal charges in this case.\" In a statement Thursday, Busch said he is grateful that the prosecutors decided not to file charges. \"I wish to thank my family, friends, fans, and race team who stood by me throughout this nightmare with their unwavering support,\" Busch said. \"Thanks also goes to my legal team for making sure that the truth got out and was fully provided to the prosecutors.  As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse. I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" While Busch will not be charged, he must stay away from Driscoll for one year, a Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February. Driscoll had requested a no-contact order against Busch. Stemming from the family court ruling, NASCAR suspended Busch indefinitely shortly before the Daytona 500. That decision was upheld after appeal. CNN has reached out to NASCAR for an update on Busch's status but did not immediately hear back. \"Patricia and I are very disappointed that Kurt will not be prosecuted for the abusive acts he committed in September,\" Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, said Thursday. \"The (attorney general's) decision, however, only makes the order that we received for protection from abuse that much more important. \"As you can see, in some cases, this is the only protection the victim will get. This civil no contact order is a critical tool for protecting victims.\" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, previously has said that he would appeal the family court ruling and would continue to work to clear Busch's name. At the no-contact hearing, Busch testified that he believes Driscoll is a trained assassin for the U.S. government and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood. Driscoll is a defense contractor and is authorized to carry weapons. McNeice has said that her client denies Busch's allegations."}

His victory was unexpected, as polls had suggested the Zionist Union alliance would win. Exit polls showed the two parties neck and neck, but pollster Avi Degani believes other pollsters relied too heavily on Internet technology.", "article": "Jerusalem  (CNN)Benjamin Netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as Israel's Prime Minister, declaring victory Wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last-minute appeals to right-wing voters. For weeks, Netanyahu's Likud party trailed in opinion polls to the Zionist Union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary Israelis better. Those polls turned out to be wrong. Instead, the Likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee, based on 99% of the vote. Its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government. The Zionist Union came in second, with at least 24 seats. \"Against all odds, against all odds, we achieved this huge victory for Likud,\" Netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed Tuesday. \"We achieved the huge victory for our people.  And I am proud, I am proud for the people of Israel that in the moment of truth, knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things.\" Rather than courting voters in the middle, Netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning Israel's security. Two weeks ago, he made a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress warning of any deal with Iran on its nuclear program. Then, a few days ago, he declared there would be no Palestinian state so long as he's Prime Minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the Obama administration's support for a two-state solution. On Tuesday, he released a video on Facebook claiming leftists were bringing \"huge amounts\" of Arabs by bus to vote against Likud. Arabs make up about 20% of Israel's population. \"The right regime is in danger,\" Netanyahu said. \"We have an urgent wake-up call. Bring your friends, bring your family, vote for Likud.\" Those appeals appear \"to have energized that right-wing base,\" according to CNN's Elise Labott. Netanyahu still has to form a new government, a process that President Reuven Rivlin said he hopes will start Sunday. If the Likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave Israel not much different than it was before the election, with a conservative Netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug-in opposition. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory. Isaac Herzog, who led the Zionist Union, called Netanyahu to concede defeat. But he and fellow opposition leader Tzipi Livni won't go away, with Herzog insisting that \"nothing has changed.\" \"This is not the time for coalitions and governments,\" Herzog said, apparently ruling out joining forces with Netanyahu as the Labor Party has done before. \"I think what Israel is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth. \"And I'm telling everyone, 'Believe, a change will come.' \" Official results will not be released until next week, with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer. No party has ever won a majority of seats in the Knesset, meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of Israel. The victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61-seat majority. Aaron David Miller, an ex-adviser to the U.S. government on Arab-Israeli negotiations now with the Wilson Center, predicts former Israeli Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon will be the \"kingmaker\" in any coalition government deal based on the support his Kulanu party got Tuesday. How does Israel's parliament work? There's no guarantee Netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister. But he's got a better chance than anyone, and overnight he vowed to work \"quickly and responsibly to form a new government.\" \"Our country's everyday reality doesn't give us the luxury for delay,\" Netanyahu said. If he does lead the next government, he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in Israel -- thanks to his back-to-back-to-back election wins. Many woke up Wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that Netanyahu's latest six-year term could be coming to an end. Israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the Zionist Union would win the vote or, at least, finish in a dead heat with Likud. Exit polls from Israel's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck, not the apparent five-seat advantage that Likud appears to have secured. So what happened? Pollster Avi Degani, who predicted a Likud win all along, said other pollsters relied too heavily on Internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" Degani said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the"}

One of the great mysteries of mankind \u2014 and I mean mankind \u2014 may have been solved. Scientists from King\u2019s College London have measured 15,000 penises in 16 countries. This work has allowed them, after feeding the findings into computers, making boffinish statistical adjustments, twiddling knobs and squinting at graphs, to announce an average size for chaps\u2019 undercarriage. That, in turn, has been seized on as having psychological significance. Apparently, we men are now less likely to have a nervous collapse about our own shortcomings. Quentin says that\u00a0Michelangelo\u2019s 16th century statue of the naked David (pictured), can sometimes be a source of fun for being a 'tiddler' We have not been told the logistical ins and out, if that is the term, of this ground-breaking global operation. The research demanded at least two readings (one at ease, one standing to quivering attention) for each handsome specimen. The mind boggles. Were the laboratory assistants who took the data dreary, middle-aged men speaking in the monotones of E. L. Wisty (the know-it-all creation of the comedian Peter Cook)? Or were they busty, sultry ladies with husky larynxes and widening eyes? To what level of exactitude were the measurements taken? What instruments were employed \u2014 school rulers, tape measures, laser micrometers or (ouch) cold, industrial calipers? While we\u2019re about it, exactly how, in 16 languages, do you say \u2018sorry to interrupt your busy day, monsieur, but would you mind dropping your drawers so that my pouting assistant Miss Droop can take the bore and length of your old man\u2019? But back to the conclusions. Dr David Veale, the fine body of a man who led the psychiatrists from King\u2019s, has announced that the average length of an erect penis is 5.16 in. Typically, it sounds more in Continental centimetres \u2014 13.12 cm. The figure shrivels to 3.6 in when the member is in a state of genial repose. If we can place this in context, the late Sue Townsend\u2019s spotty schoolboy character Adrian Mole fretted that his \u2018thing\u2019 rose to a mere 4.3 in, something that gave the poor lad hours of angst, while the once accepted norm, at least of myth, was nearly half as much again \u2014 the old \u2018six inches of proud British manhood\u2019. Michelangelo\u2019s 16th century statue of the naked David, sometimes a source of fun for being a tiddler, may not have been so unusual after all. You may think it peculiar that I dwell on these matters, not least for what I am about to say: I seriously doubt that many blokes are much concerned by these readings. I do not mean that they will not have been interested and amused by yesterday\u2019s news reports. Indeed, I bet most of us, when we read the Mail, discreetly did some thumbwork to try to work out what 5.16 in looks like, and then had a rough gander below decks to see how we fared by comparison. But will men have been psychologically affected? Does size matter to us as it is said to matter, particularly to our wives and girlfriends? Or is this yet another attempt by the medical/psychiatric world to create collywobbles where previously few existed? Dr Veale said his findings would \u2018help doctors reassure the large majority of men that the size of their penis is in the normal range\u2019. He said he would \u2018use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position\u2019. Another doctor disclosed that some men, poor fellows, suffer from something called body dysmorphic disorder, which can cause a person to have a distorted view of how he looks. Apparently, this is a serious source of anxiety to some gents, who become convinced they are laughably tiny. One does not wish to downplay the gravity of body dysmorphic disorder, which no doubt exists. One naturally has sympathy with those who may worry that they have been given short commons in the trouser department by the Almighty.

And some dogs, like Fritz the golden retriever from California, are not \u2013 as demonstrated by its owner, who collated  the canine's failed attempts to catch different food items in slow motion. Standing before the camera the dog initially looks calm, composed and ready to make its owner proud. Fritz waits patiently at the start of the video and looks composed before the first item comes his way. Spotting the piece of meat the dog licks its lips in anticipation and locks its eyes on the prize. The owner tosses the piece of meat, which travels in a straight line and at a good pace towards the dog. But as Fritz opens his mouth to make the catch, he leans back just too far and the meat hits him  in the face. After licking its lips at the prospect of a piece of meat, the dog mistimes his jump and is clobbered with it. Leaning back too far the dog is unable to anticipate the flight of a doughnut and it hits him in the neck. Next up is a doughnut, and while not the healthiest piece of food for a dog, one would think the bigger surface area would surely make the task easier. Jumping too eagerly once more Fritz mistimes the doughnut's flight and the food item hits him in the neck. With a new Stars and Stripes bandana comes new opportunities in the form of a meatball and a taco, but the dog once again makes a mess of the catches and the taco explodes against its face. The dog pulls out of his attempt to catch a taco and it smashes against his face and breaks apart. A strawberry appears to by flying directly into the dog's mouth before it bounces off his nose. Gaining a crowd, the dog later attempts to catch a strawberry but despite following the flight of the fruit it ricochets off his nose and onto the floor. The final food items include a hot dog, which covers him in ketchup, and a slice of pizza, which collides awkwardly with his ear. The video concludes with a moment of success as the golden retriever manages to catch a single chip with the side of its mouth. The dog follows the flight of the hot dog but is unable to catch it and is instead covered in ketchup. Success at last!

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Robin opened up about her unorthodox decision, which she says was triggered by her husband's vasectomy. Scroll down for video. Appearing on ITV's This Morning Robin Rinaldi, now 50,\u00a0opened up about her unorthodox lifestyle. Robin was content in marriage for years - but she wanted kids and he didn't she decided to try an open marriage' The arrangement which she described as '5:2 marriage' involved spending weekdays sleeping with strangers and weekends with her husband. 'I would say before the year I was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied, normal loving relationship,' she said of her 17 year marriage to\u00a0Scott Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker. 'But when I got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and I knew the discussion of having a baby was over, which kick-started this experience,' she explained. 'I looked forward to my death bed and thought. \"What will I have?\" I won\u2019t have children and grandchildren. Will I at least have lived fully?\"' 'If I couldn\u2019t have one I wanted the other,' she explained. 'Like a lot of women at that age I was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that I wasn\u2019t going to have children. It was the perfect storm. Robino said having'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city' 'WIld oats': Robin, 50, negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years, which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship. 'I have had lots of people telling me I should have travelled the world, tried painting classes or cooking \u2013 but I already know how to cook!' She also said having'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city'. 'I was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation,'she said. 'So I thought OK whilst we do that I need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same.' Under the terms of her new deal, Rinaldi took out an apartment, where she lived from Monday to Friday and would bed her conquests. But over the weekend she would go back to Mansfield, and the two would live as a married couple, without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart. 'The ground rules were safe sex, not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances,' she explained. 'But at the end of the year, we each broke two rules.' To find willing participants in her project Robin decided not to pick up men at bars, but to be more strategic in her search. 'I was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had I picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand,' she explains. 'So I felt like going about it in a more clear-headed, conscious way.' Robin posted an online ad, entitled Good Girl Seeks Experience. In the post, she wrote: 'I'm a 44-year-old professional, educated, attractive woman in an open marriage, seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality.' 'I said I wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks. I explained that if it led to sex then great, but that I couldn\u2019t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times.' The next day, Robin had 23 offers and over the course of the year had 12 sexual partners, including two women. Struggle: Robin said her husband, Scott Mansfield, right, was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children, driving her to want lovers instead. So would she advise it? \u2018Not if you want to stay married,' she told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden. 'Read my book instead and have an armchair adventure.' 'I was well aware it would be very risky \u2013 but I didn\u2019t think we had that much to lose. 'This 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle. 'That happened at first,' she said, but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart.

{"abstract": "The Green Party held its spring conference in Liverpool, where its bumbling leader Natalie Bennett spoke to enthusiastic delegates. The party has seen a surge in membership, with many young people inspired by the idea of reshaping politics. The Greens have proposed a number of ambitious policies, such as free university education and a basic income for everyone, but it is unclear how these would be paid for.", "article": "Bumbling: Natalie Bennett on stage at the spring conference in Liverpool. The Greens like to do things differently. One of their deputy leaders had just blown a few billion pounds more from their wish-list budget when the chairwoman \u2013 who could hardly be seen in her green jumper against the vast green background \u2013 announced an \u2018attunement\u2019. This turned out to be a reflective \u2013 and to my mind rather long \u2013 minute\u2019s silence. \u2018It\u2019s incredibly successful if people get stressed,\u2019 explained our host, although several people around me merely used the pause to check social media on their smartphones. Welcome to the world of Britain\u2019s wackiest political party, on display this weekend at its spring conference in Liverpool. There is something mildly amusing about a party that insists on meditative breaks, has a keynote speaker identified as \u2018a non-binary person from Belarus\u2019 and chairwomen who say things like: \u2018I would like to hear from someone who does not identify as a man.\u2019 And a party that uses such a contorted form of internal democracy it ends up with daft policies to ban most cars and seriously debates proposals to extend human rights to all animals. Yet this is currently the country\u2019s most successful political party, attracting 100 recruits a day from people dismayed by traditional party politics. Bizarrely, the duffest interviews given by its bumbling leader Natalie Bennett only drive up membership. Joining the hundreds of enthusiastic delegates \u2013 a mixture of grizzly bearded hippies, elderly ideologues, earnest young recruits and well-spoken women in charity shop chic \u2013 offered fresh insight into what is now the third biggest party in England and Wales. They proclaim the politics of the future. Yet much of the time it felt like I had stumbled into an Alan Bennett sketch filled with middle-class people munching on non-meat sandwiches as they debated how to save a world wrecked by austerity, bankers and Conservatives. Scroll down for video. Bennett (the leader, that is) told her adoring followers the Greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today. This is undoubtedly impressive. But it also means they might play an influential role in determining who runs the country after the next Election. Many of these new members \u2013 half of whom voted Liberal Democrat at the last Election \u2013 are young people inspired by the idea of reshaping politics. They were given special badges declaring their status and enthusiastically snapped up green T-shirts on sale. Presumably they were not the people targeted in a seminar explaining how to use email. Yet for all these new recruits rushing around excitedly, there were also the same old stalls offering vegan recipes for raspberry cake, T-shirts emblazoned with \u2018Still Hate Thatcher\u2019 and angry leaflets denouncing the monarchy. Bennett  told her followers the Greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today. On one, I found Jon Liebling, a friendly 47-year-old dancer promoting the medicinal use of cannabis. He said he had smoked the drug for 26 years to curb anxiety attacks. His stall proclaimed \u2018United Patients Alliance with Norml Women\u2019s Alliance\u2019. When I asked about Norml Women, he said its founders \u2018felt there was too much testosterone in the cannabis movement\u2019 \u2013 but they had not turned up and he had forgotten the acronym\u2019s meaning. The Australian-born Bennett promises a new style of politics \u2013 which many people might say she exemplifies with her stumbling interviews and inability to explain key policies. Yet after she spoke on Friday, managing to avoid \u2018mind blanks\u2019 as she promised lots of new taxes, the grey-haired woman next to me could not stop gushing: \u2018I am so excited. I am overwhelmed. I feel like I belong here.\u2019 She turned out to be a Labour deserter. And this is why the sudden Green surge is giving her previous party palpitations as it is outflanked on the left. Indeed, electoral mathematics mean it is possible the Greens might not just impact on voting outcomes in May but even be in position to join a coalition led by Ed Miliband. This is a party that wants to ban the monarchy, House of Lords, much of the Armed Forces, free schools, foie gras and fur \u2013 while freeing up drugs, borders, brothels and, said its leader, allowing people to join terror groups such as Islamic State. Yesterday they chucked in free university undergraduate education, joining the Greens\u2019 desires for free social care, free universal childcare, 500,000 extra new homes and a basic income for everyone costing almost three times the budget of the National Health Service. Since they also want to end economic growth, I asked their press team how these policies would be paid for. \u2018There\u2019s lots of money around,\u2019 replied one party veteran, looking at me as though I was stupid.

Lal Hardy is tasked with turning people's disaster pieces into masterpieces, such as this Marilyn Monroe, left, he shaded in to create an artsy monster, right. Speaking about why people come to see him to have their inks modified, he said: 'The reasons really vary from some that are just plain bad, some designs are dated, some want bigger work or others are names of ex-lovers. 'Personally, I am brutally honest with people regarding cover-ups. If I think it can't be covered I tell the client, the same if I think they have unrealistic expectations as to how a tattoo can be covered. I now only take on cover-ups or reworks that I feel will work.' Four of Lal's most prized cover-ups include a lion design that was transformed from some squiggles into a fierce inking. Lal says he transforms 'plain bad' ones, adds to some - like this seemingly unfinished lion tattoo - or makes dated ones more modern. More straightforward renovations include a robin playing card, left, which Lal re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border, right. Speaking about the renovation work, he said: 'The lion was done by an amateur artist and because it was only partially done, it was possible to salvage it and cover it up.' He also worked his magic on a faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose. Another botched design he fixed was a faded Marilyn Monroe inking. 'The cover up worked because the client researched a design he wanted, his original Monroe was faded and the new design had lots of detail and shading so lent itself well to a cover up,' said Lal.

More straightforward renovations include a robin playing card, which Lal re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border to give a splash of colour to the new piece. 'The cover-up process depends on various factors like the size of the tattoo, how faded it is and the density of the dark pigments in it as darker colours are harder to cover,' he explained. 'The amount of clear skin around it is also a consideration as this can open up the opportunity to incorporate the cover-up in a bigger piece. The placement of the tattoo on the body can also be a major factor in whether or not a cover up can be done.' Tattoo Nightmares airs at 9pm every Monday on truTV freeview channel 68 and Sky 565."}

Vuong asked the public for help in solving the mystery surrounding her husband's death. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. Messerschmitt, a 30-year-old D.C. attorney, was found partially clothed and stabbed in the back at the upscale boutique hotel.

He also described some Muslims in Britain as a 'fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us'. Setting out the case for scrapping race laws, Mr Farage said: 'I think the situation that we now have, where an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland, is a ludicrous state of affairs. 'I think that we have taken our relationship with Europe to a level that, frankly, has gone against common sense, and certainly against self-interest. 'I would argue that the law does need changing, and that if an employer wishes to choose, or you can use the word 'discriminate' if you want to, but wishes to choose to employ a British-born person, they should be allowed to do so. 'I think you should be able to choose on the basis of nationality, yes.\u00a0I do.'

He claimed the rise of British-born Islamist extremists going to fight with ISIS in Syria had fuelled an 'uptick' in public concern. He added: 'I think perhaps one of the reasons the polls show an increasing level of concern is because people do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us. So don't be surprised if there isn't a slight increase in people's worries and concerns. 'You know, when you've got British, when you've got people, born and bred in Cardiff, with British passports, going out to fight for Isil, don't be surprised if there isn't an uptick in concern. There has been an uptick in concern, but does it make us a prejudiced people? No.' 'There is an especial problem with some of the people who've come here and who are of the Muslim religion who don't want to become part of our culture. 'So there is no previous experience, in our history, of a migrant group that comes to Britain, that fundamentally wants to change who we are and what we are. That is, I think, above everything else, what people are really concerned about.' The remarks sparked a furious row, with political opponents accusing the Ukip leader of fuelling racial tensions.

'Newcastle fans at the minute are showing why they are some of the best around, because they can't dream. They've been told the cups aren't a priority, that finishing 10th in the Premier League is more important.' The former striker calls for squad investment in the summer but doubts much will change under current owner Mike Ashley, and insists the club should pursue Cup glory more seriously. Newcastle legend, now a pundit with Match of the Day, has criticised the club's lack of ambition. Despite his injury problems Papiss Cisse has become a crucial player for John Carver at Newcastle. 'Unless the club are going to bring in a load of exciting players in the summer, which is highly unlikely when you look at the way it's been run, then I think people might look at giving up. I can only tell you what my mates are thinking about doing because of the lack of hope at the minute,' added Shearer. 'I'd dearly love us to have a cup run, I'd dearly love us to get to Wembley again, I'd much rather that than just finish in mid-table year after year. 'It's not going to happen because we've played a weakened team in every cup game. They've been playing weakened teams in cup competitions since 2007.' Cisse draws the congratulations after scoring the winner for Newcastle against Aston Villa on Saturday. The Senegalese international made a beeline for Jonas Gutierrez to celebrate his winning goal. Shearer is a hero at St James' Park having scored over 200 goals for the Magpies over a decade with the club."}

This is because the club used an accounting method to count a \u00a360m write-off of loans to the owners as effective income. If QPR avoid relegation from the Premier League this season, they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied.", "article": "Financial accounts for QPR show their'real' losses last season were almost \u00a370million - a figure that still leaves them facing a fine of more than \u00a350m. The Football League's complex Financial Fair Play rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs. A tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend. Earlier this month QPR announced they had made a loss of \u00a39.8m but the accounts filed at Companies House now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of the owners, mainly Tony Fernandes, writing off \u00a360m of old loans in an 'exceptional item' in the accounts. QPR owner Tony Fernandes was among those to write off \u00a360million of old loans to the London club. QPR's players get put through their paces in training ahead of Saturday's game against Crystal Palace. Q: Queens Park Rangers accounts for 2013-14 have now been filed in detail at Companies House. What do they show? A: They show that the club\u2019s \u2018true\u2019 losses for last season were \u00a369.8m, instead of the \u00a39.8m declared by the club earlier this month. They used an accounting method, an \u2018exceptional item\u2019, to count a \u00a360m write-off of loans to the owners as effective income. Their real income was \u00a338.7m. Q: Why does this matter? A: Because if clubs lose lots of money in the Championship, where QPR played last season, they face potential \u2018Financial Fair Play\u2019 fines from the Football League. The FFP rules are in place to stop clubs \u2018financial doping\u2019 and stop them spending themselves to bankruptcy. To simplify: clubs that massively overspend, and lose lots of money as a result, face fans which grow in relation to the overspending. Q: How much fine do QPR face? A: If they\u2019d really lost only \u00a39.8m last season, the fine would have been tiny, perhaps not even a million pounds. But if the real loss is \u00a369.8m, the fine could be as high as \u00a358m, and is likely to be at least \u00a350m. That would be the biggest fine on any club for any reason in global football history. Q: Who will decide? A: Lawyers, probably. The parties are locked in talks about what happens next. Q: What do QPR say? A: No comment. Effectively, QPR counted that \u00a360m write-off as extra income. But that money is noted in the accounts as being a'related-party transaction' - and the Football League's own FFP rules explicitly rule out that related party moves of the kind QPR have undertaken. The League rule out such moves in order to prevent 'artificially' lowered losses. A QPR spokesman told Sportsmail: 'We have no comment.' A Football League spokesman reiterated an earlier League statement that the League remains in talks with QPR about the situation, but won't add details. If the League ultimately rule that QPR's'real' losses are \u00a369.8m, then the FFP fine they potentially face will be \u00a357.9m. QPR will legitimately be able to write off some of that \u00a369.8m as acceptable losses - for youth investment, and some bonuses, for example - but realistically they are looking at a fine of \u00a350m-plus. Yet QPR are locked in legal arguments questioning whether the League have the right to levy any fine at all, and if they do, at what levels. QPR posted losses of \u00a365.4m in the 2012-13 season and it was expected these might fall after cost-cutting in the Championship. But the new accounts show in fact that as QPR's income plunged from \u00a360.6m in 2012-13 to \u00a338.7m in 2013-14, there was no significant reduction in the biggest single outgoing - player wages. The wage bill was \u00a378m in the 2012-13 season and \u00a375.4m in 2013-14 in the Championship. Quite how this now plays out remains to be seen: lawyers are likely to remain occupied for weeks if not months or years on both sides. Junior Hoilett (centre) has an effort on goal as QPR prepare for a relegation clash at Selhurst Park. Striker Charlie Austin is in discussions over a new \u00a360,000-a-week deal at Loftus Road. QPR could refuse to pay a Football League fine if Chris Ramsey keeps the club in the Premier League. If QPR avoid relegation from the Premier League this season, they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied and the Football League will not be able to force them to pay while they remain in the Premier League - and outside Football League jurisdiction. The worst-case scenario for QPR is relegation to the Football League while continuing to"}

Georgie Yorke was born with birth defects that meant her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach. This meant that whenever her mother tried to feed her with a bottle, milk would come back out of her nose and mouth. Georgie was rushed to surgery to undergo an operation to connect the oesophagus to the trachea just 22 hours after she was born on July 10 2014. Georgie Yorke, now eight months, was born with birth defects meaning whenever she was fed, milk shot back out of her nose and mouth. She is pictured with parents Stacey Ross, 25 and Vic Yorke. Georgie\u00a0was born with the birth defects oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - meaning her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach. Georgie was rushed for an operation to correct the defects when she was just two days old. She has since had five more operations to further correct the problem and rid her of scar tissue. Georgie, aged eight months, is now out of hospital and finally able to enjoy life at home with parents Stacey Ross, 25, and Vic Yorke, 19, from Consett, County Durham. Ms Ross, a travel agent, said: 'When Georgie was born, I was rushed in for an emergency C-section, so I didn't get to hold her in the beginning. 'When I finally tried to feed her that night, the milk was coming out of her nose and mouth and going everywhere - almost like when you drink a fizzy drink and it shoots out of your nose. 'I thought it might have been me - and because I was trying to feed her on my own. 'But when the midwife came around to help me, she realised something was wrong as the milk was going down the wrong tube and Georgie's breathing wasn't right. 'She was taken away from me a few times in the night and taken into special care. It wasn't until they X-rayed her that I was told what was wrong.' Oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that affects the baby's oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. In oesophageal atresia, the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. It often happens together with another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe (trachea). This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass into the lungs. It's not known why the defect develops, but it's more likely to happen in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid in pregnancy (polyhydramnios). The defect means the baby won't be able to swallow and digest food safely, or at all. Oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula are thought to affect about one in 2,500-3,500 births. If they're not corrected soon after birth, the pouch at the end of the oesophagus may fill with food and saliva, which can overflow into the baby's windpipe. Source: NHS Choices. Doctors diagnosed Georgie with oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - two conditions that tend to occur together. In oesophageal atresia, the upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach. It ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. The condition often occurs alongside another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula.

This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass into the lungs. Georgie was kept in surgery for five hours and spent six days in intensive care at the Great North Childrens' Hospital, Newcastle. Ms Ross said: 'I was shocked to see her go straight into surgery, but I didn't really know what to think at first. 'All I could think when I saw her lying there was that I wished it could have been me. 'I couldn't wait for the three of us to get home together, so it wasn't a nice feeling to know that we couldn't even put the banners up at home to welcome the baby.' Since the initial surgery, Georgie has had a further five operations to correct her tubes and scar tissue. She will have to undergo further operations, but is"}
{"abstract": "The Royal College of General Practitioners is proposing to draft pharmacists into GP practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors. This would involve pharmacists working as part of the general team, providing day-to-day care for patients with long-term conditions. The move is backed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the British Medical Association, and could help reduce waiting times and improve patient care.", "article": "Pharmacists will be drafted into GP practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors, under plans to be unveiled today. The proposals could see pharmacists stationed in surgeries to help meet the day-to-day needs of patients with long-term conditions, including diabetes and asthma. Instead of seeing a GP, those patients could be given an appointment with a pharmacist. They would also liaise with hospitals, community pharmacists and care homes to ensure patients received seamless care. Experts said the move would cut the time patients have to wait for appointments, while also addressing the chronic shortage of GPs at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists. Pharmacists are to be drafted into GP practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors in the NHS, under new plans. Many GP surgeries already work closely with pharmacists, and the proposals would see them working as part of the general team, in a similar way to practice nurses, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said. Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the RCGP, said a 'hidden army' of pharmacists could provide the solution to the pressures facing family doctors. She said: 'Waiting times for a GP appointment are now a national talking point - and a national cause for concern, not least amongst GPs themselves. 'But, even if we were to get an urgent influx of extra funding and more GPs, we could not turn around the situation overnight due to the length of time it takes to train a GP. 'Yet we already have a 'hidden army' of highly trained pharmacists who could provide a solution. 'Practice-based pharmacists, working as part of the clinical team, would relieve the pressure on GPs and make a huge difference to patient care. 'This isn't about having a pharmacy premises within a surgery, but about making full use of the pharmacist's clinical skills to help patients and the overstretched GP workforce.' GP surgeries are predicted to make 370 million patient consultations this year - 70 million more than five years ago. An ageing population and an increase in those patients needing treatment for long-term and complex conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, is, in part, the cause of the mounting pressure. The RCGP said according to their research, there will be 67 million occasions when patients will have to wait a week or longer to see a GP or practice nurse this year. Pharmacists train for five years, one year less than a doctor and a year more than a nurse. As such, the RCGP, which is being backed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, has argued they are ideally placed to treat patients directly within GP practices. The RCGP is calling for general practice funding to be increased to 11 per cent of the NHS budget by 2017 - currently it stands at just over eight per cent. Furthermore, the College is calling for 8,000 more GPs in England by the end of the next Parliament. David Branford, chairman of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society English board, said: 'General practice is the foundation of the NHS but it needs proper resourcing and support. Experts said the move would cut the times patients have to wait for appointments, while also addressing the chronic shortage of GPs at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists. 'Having a pharmacist as part of the team can make a huge difference to both patients and clinical colleagues. 'Pharmacists should be working in GP practices all over the country.  It's a win-win situation for everyone concerned. 'We must be more strategic and change the services on offer to make best use of the NHS workforce. 'Patients deserve access to high quality care and services wherever they live and pharmacists are central to providing this.' Dr Chaand Nagpaul, GP committee chairman at the British Medical Association, said:  'Placing more pharmacists into GP practice teams is a move the BMA has been advocating for some time. 'This proposal has the potential to improve the skills mix in local GP services and raise the number of healthcare professionals on hand to provide help to patients. 'This will be a welcome step forward,given that GP practices are currently under unprecedented strain from rising patient demand and falling resources. 'The implementation of this programme will be key. For it to work properly, there will need to be additional resources to enable enough pharmacists to be placed in GP surgeries. 'A further limiting factor at present is that many GP practices are struggling because their buildings are inadequate or don't have space to expand staffing.'"}

De Villiers underpinned South Africa's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six, before taking two for 15 from three overs as the UAE were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining. De Villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century, but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 World Cup matches overall. South Africa captain AB de Villiers (right) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the UAE. The explosive batsman hit 99 for the Proteas as they continued they impressive form in the World Cup. De Villers also took two wickets with the ball at the Wellington Regional Stadium on Thursday. The victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for South Africa as the UAE slumped to a fifth defeat in as many World Cup games. The Proteas, already through to the knockout phase, set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at Westpac Stadium. De Villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with David Miller, after Hashim Amla (12), Quinton de Kock (26) and Rilee Rossouw (43) had departed, and added a further 53 in partnership with JP Duminy. Miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over, bowled by Mohammad Naveed, who claimed figures of three for 63. De Villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to Amjad Javed, and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from Kamran Shazad straight to Javed at short third man. His departure signalled the arrival of Farhaan Behardien, though, and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the South African score racing along. Farhaan Bahardien also shone for South Africa with the bat in Wellington. UAE have lost all five of their World Cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs. Duminy (23) became Naveed's third victim when he was trapped lbw, but Behardien and Vernon Philander (10 not out) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand. The UAE's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs. Morne Morkel led the early charge for the Proteas, dismissing Andri Berenger (five) and Khurram Khan (12) as he took two for four from his first four overs, while Duminy claimed Amjad Ali's (21) wicket in between. Shaiman Anwar and Swapnil Patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite, but when Anwar (39) sent Imran Tahir's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again. Saqlain Haider (seven) replaced Anwar at the crease, but he only lasted three overs to become De Villiers' first victim of the day, before Javed (five) followed suit soon after to leave the UAE on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left. De Villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as Naveed (17) top-edged Philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of Mohammad Tauqir (three) and Shazad (nought) meant the UAE fell short of completing their 50 overs. Swapnil Patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50."}

The shocking incident was captured on the train's surveillance camera and also recorded by a passenger who posted his cell phone footage online. The video shows a man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap approach Autry who was sitting at the front of the train. According to Autry, the attacker first asked to use his cell phone. When he refused, the man asked for his opinion on the death of Michael Brown. 'I responded I was too tired to think about it right now,' Autry told KMOV. 'The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face.' Two other men then join in, with one swinging a left hand punch at the victim's head. As the train pulled into a station, the man in the red T-shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, but declined medical treatment. Autry told KMOV he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh. 'I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,' he said. 'And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.' Autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $5,000 to buy a motorcycle. The page was setup on Saturday and he has already raised more $4,500. Autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes. David Autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh. Writing on his GoFundMe page about why he did not fight back, he said: 'First, I was dazed from the sucker punch in the face. 'Second, c'mon 3 against one? I was trying to protect my glasses. I didn't know they were on the floor all bent up and the lens popped out. 'Third, if I had stood up and fought, only white guy on that train car, how do I know I wouldn't be attacked from behind as well? It's easy to say what YOU would have done until you find yourself in that situation.' Authorities in St. Louis have yet to release the names or images of the two suspects apprehended with what they are calling a misdemeanor third-degree assault. A third man pictured in the surveillance video was identified but not arrested following an investigation.

Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed. Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car. At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March. Miller previously served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for planning the killing of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder. He was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car."}

Doting dad: Garth Callaghan, 45, from Glen Allen, Virginia, has been writing short messages on napkins for his daughter Emma, 15, since she was in kindergarten - and now she looks forward to them every day. Heartwarming ritual: This week the doting father-of-one, who has prostate and kidney cancer, uploaded this snapshot to Facebook revealing his latest note. Garth says doctors do not know how long he has to live but he's determined to remain strong. 'My goal is to actually write notes for my grandkids and I can't think of a better thing to fight for every single day.' Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness. 'I don't even really think about the fact he has cancer too much because he's so present and always there.' The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household; it began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often. Battling on: Garth says doctors do not know how long he has to live but he's determined to remain strong. Source of support: Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness. Long-running: The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household. Thoughtful gesture: It began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often. Daily dose: So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. Still going strong: But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos. So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos. Some days, she would look at her lunch before he had placed on inside, and she'd demand to know where it was. 'That's when I realized, this is something that really matters,' Garth said. Garth's wife, Lissa, said the task also means he's taken over the chore of making his daughter's lunch, which he tries to keep healthy. 'I think it's great,' she said. 'It's nice that he keeps that connection with her.' Lunchtime treat: He pops the notes in with her lunch, which he tries to make as nutritious as he can. Determined: After learning he had cancer, Garth sought to write 800 notes so that his daughter would have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box. But in 2011, Garth was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because, 'at the end of the day, these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me'. His tumor was successfully removed - but he has since been diagnosed twice more, and his doctor has told him that he will lose his life to the disease. A loss of taste, tiredness and nausea are among the symptoms which blight Garth. He says his ultimate hope is to inspire parents to write notes to their children. His book, Napkin Notes: Make Lunch Meaningful, Life Will Follow, has been published in several countries and half a dozen languages. In the tome, Garth  introduces each chapter with a napkin note and then shares a story connected to it and to his life. The cancer patient is now writing notes ahead of time and storing them away so his daughter can still\u00a0receive\u00a0them after he is gone.

Gibson's new book, Giant Killer, offers a deeper perspective on his time at the club, which he describes as a \"boarding school of very naughty boys\". He now works for Sky Sports, commenting on Spanish football.", "article": "Terry Gibson is sitting in a restaurant in Wimbledon, recalling the 12 absurd and wonderful chapters of his life that were spent in this part of town. \u2018It was nuts,\u2019 he says. \u2018You didn\u2019t need Fash and Jonesy to lie about what went on \u2014 the reality was mad enough.\u2019 In time, Gibson will come back to the sore point of how the Wimbledon side of the Eighties was represented in a recent documentary. Terry Gibson laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for Wimbledon's Crazy Gang. He will address the myth that the Crazy Gang was ruled by the bullying of John Fashanu and Vinnie Jones, even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing-room fight. But, for now, Gibson wants to laugh rather than seethe. The little striker, who won the Cup, once told Alex Ferguson where to go and pocketed \u00a3200 for scouting Pablo Zabaleta, wants to present a fuller picture of life at Plough Lane. \u2018I remember Dennis Wise,\u2019 he says. \u2018Just after we won the FA Cup in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for Bobby Gould to give him a big move. We went on a trip to Sweden and he\u2019s bought a load of fireworks. Back at the hotel, Wisey is letting them off from the fifth floor into a crowded street. The locals are running for cover. Unbelievable. Bobby knew he was trying to force a move and wouldn\u2019t budge. Just another day at Wimbledon.\u2019 The Wimbledon players celebrate having won the 1988 FA Cup at Wembley against favourites Liverpool. Gibson poses for the camera when speaking to Sportsmail's\u00a0Riath Al-Samarrai about his career. Gibson laughs. \u2018There was a time when Fash was telling the newspapers he was getting threatening letters at the training ground,\u2019 he says. \u2018We all knew it was rubbish so one day I cut out letters from a newspaper, like in the films, and spelled, \u201cMeester Fash, we are watching your every move\u201d. I slipped it in his pocket and when he found it he starts panicking. He disappears with his big mobile phone and the next day\u2019s papers say Fash has had another threat. He always was a drama queen.\u2019 Gibson adds: \u2018My first day at the club, I saw Wisey pinching the Volkswagen badge off Vinnie Jones\u2019s dad\u2019s truck. Vinnie was panicking that his dad was going to kill him. \u2018There were a lot more laughs than people might have thought based only on the documentary.\u2019 John Fashanu, in action during his Wimbledon playing days, was certainly a character in the Crazy Gang. Gibson, like most associated with the programme, The Crazy Gang, has taken exception to claims from Fashanu that he was \u2018the leader\u2019 and ruled by fear. \u2018The truth is we tolerated Fash,\u2019 says Gibson, who spent six years at the club. \u2018He was a bit of a clown. He was the perfect player for us but he always tried to present himself as something he wasn\u2019t, even then. \u2018Yes, you had to be very tough to survive at the club. Grown men would cry. But there was so much more to how Wimbledon achieved what we did. For Fash to imply he controlled our dressing room with intimidation is just false. \u2018Of course there were fights but Fash exaggerated. Jonesy told the story about Fash locking the dressing room and throwing an unnamed player against a bench and splitting his leg open. Stitches, etc. Gibson was former team-mate Lawrie Sanchez's assistant at Wycombe, Northern Ireland and Fulham. \u2018The lad was Robbie Turner and, as I remember it, Fash strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil. They slipped around a bit and no punches were thrown. Yes, Robbie badly injured his calf on the bench but it was not split open with blood everywhere. \u2018The stories were all embellished. It was no Mafia, it was more a boarding school of very naughty boys.\u2019 A deeper perspective is found in Gibson\u2019s new book, Giant Killer. It\u2019s a wonderful autobiography, self-written across three years. The book charts his rise from Tottenham, to Coventry, to Manchester United and on to the high points at Wimbledon, before Gibson became Lawrie Sanchez\u2019s assistant at Northern Ireland, Fulham and Wycombe. The 52-year-old, in action for Wimbledon (right) works for Sky Sports, commenting on Spanish football. \u2018The game changed a bit in those three decades,\u2019 he says. \u2018When Spurs signed me as a kid they offered my parents a holiday and"}

French striker Giroud struck in the first half to give travelling Arsenal fans a glimmer of hope at the Stade Louis II before Ramsey grabbed a second. However, a resilient Monaco defence refused to let in another and the French side progressed to the next round on the away goals rule. Sportsmail's Rob Draper was at the game to give the lowdown in France... Arsenal. David Ospina 6. So little to do, the Colombian effectively took the evening off for much of the game. Hector Bellerin 5.5. Loves to get forward, can\u2019t be faulted in his running. But still partial to panicky moments in his own penalty area. Monaco's Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho vies with Arsenal's midfielder Francis Coquelin. Per Mertesacker 6. In control, assured. A different player altogether to the man who fell apart in the first leg. Laurent Koscielny 6.5. Almost opened the scoring with a prod on to the bat from very close range. Had less to do at the back. Nacho Monreal 5.5. Pushed on, got forward, but his delivery on the cross lets him down at times and was exposed at times. Francis Coquelin 6.5. Taking his enforcer role to heart. Twice he crunched Joao Moutinho in half in the first half but avoided a yellow card. Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla attempts a special effort during the UEFA Champions League. Santi Cazorla 6.5. Adequate but not quite the little magician that you were expecting given that he has been Arsenal\u2019s best player of late. Alexis Sanchez 5.5. Strangely lackadaisical in his passing which almost let in Monaco in the eighth minute. Booked \u2013 harshly \u2013 for a dive. His energy was impressive as ever. Mesut Ozil 7. Never stopped trying to create, always looking for the killer pass \u2013 had an extremely organised Monaco midfield with which he had to contend. Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker vies with Monaco's French defender Layvin Kurzawa. Danny Welbeck 7. A veritable bundle of energy, driving into the Monaco penalty area. His pass set up Giroud\u2019s goal. Came off on 71 minutes as influence faded. Olivier Giroud 7.5. Really excellent finish to open the scoring. His reaction and poise once the ball bounced off his head was superb. Redemptive after the first game. Subs. Aaron Ramsey (for Coquelin 62) 7 - Fine reaction and finish when Kurzawa inexplicably gave the ball to him on 79 minutes. Walcott (for Welbeck 72) 6. Gibbs (for Monreal 82) 6. Monaco defender Wallace vies with  French striker Giroud during the match  at Louis II stadium. Manager. Arsene Wenger 7. Game plan was assured, defence was solid and they gave themselves the chance. It did beg the question why they couldn\u2019t have done that in the first leg? Monaco. Danijel Subasic 8. Solid taking crosses and produced good saves, notably from Ozil\u2019s second half free-kick. Unfortunate for Giroud\u2019s goal. Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin vies with Monaco's French forward Anthony Martial during the  match. Fabinho 5. Struggled to maintain composure at times as Arsenal poured forward. A difficult night. Aymen Abdennour 6.5. Was the leader at the back, forever cajoling and generally anticipating much of Arsenal\u2019s attacking intent. Wallace 6. Preferred to the much more experienced Ricardo Carvalho and didn\u2019t let his side down. Layvin Kurzawa 4. Looked vulnerable, especially when Welbeck switched to the right. Dreadful error giving the ball away for the second goal. Monaco's Bulgarian forward Dimitar Berbatov  vies with Arsenal's French midfielder Coquelin. Geoffrey Kondogbia 7.5. Fought, tackled and ran. Did as much anyone to secure Monaco\u2019s passage to the quarters. Jeremy Toulalon 7. Composed, robust, provided leadership, especially in those tricky final few minutes. Nabil Dirar 7.5. Remained a threat even with Monaco camped in their own half. Terrific speed and desire. Joao Moutinho 6.5. Not as influential as the first leg but still fulfilled his duties and brought composure when necessary. Giroud celebrates as he gives Arsenal a glimmer of hope against Monaco at the Louis II stadium. Anthony Martial 5. Strugled to make an impact and taken of on 59 minutes. Dimitar Berbatov 7.

Spaniard Fabregas pleads for a decision under pressure from Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u00a0during a training match. But the Blues boss will give his squad two days off after the West Ham clash and has given them permission to enjoy themselves. Mourinho said: 'Maybe they went out with some family for dinner [after Wembley], but I don't think they did any crazy things because, the next day, I saw them in very good condition. 'They will have Thursday and Friday off, and I told them those are the best moments if they want to do something that people at their age sometimes like to do. 'But they enjoyed it so much after the game on the pitch and in the dressing room, but even on the bus going back to Stamford Bridge was a normal journey.' Eden Hazard twists and turns in an attempt to shake off Oscar as the Brazilian tracks down the Belgian.

'Big, difficult game on Wednesday. Big, difficult game next week in the Champions League [against Paris Saint Germain]. We are just happy. Everybody likes to win competitions.' Asked if captain John Terry will sort out new contract terms before the end of the season, Mourinho was certain in his response but admitted he is thinking ahead to life after the 34-year-old. 'Yes, it will be [extended] before the end of the season for sure. What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that. 'Every one of these big guys is difficult to replace, but at the same time you still have the player and he is still an important player, you have to start thinking: 'What next?

Depending on Manchester City's result against Leicester on Wednesday, Chelsea can either increase their lead or maintain a five point gap at the top of the division with a win against West Ham. However Mourinho refused to underestimate his opposition, revealing that he will not be deploying defender Kurt Zouma in a deep-lying midfield role like he did against Spurs. '[West Ham] have in their hands different ways of playing football, different ways of seeing the game, and with a very good coach like Sam, it's always difficult to play there.' 'I don't play the same team. I don't play the same 11 players, that's for sure. [Zouma] is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear. 'We didn't have Matic and Mikel in a final where it was important to keep the balance of the team. We needed someone to do that job. 'He did very well, but it's not his future at Chelsea to play in that position.' Midfielder John Obi Mikel is expected to be out for a further month after surgery on his knee. Costa celebrates after his shot deflected in off Kyle Walker to put Chelsea 2-0 up against Spurs. Chelsea's squad look jubilant after their first trophy of the season but Mourinho said celebrations were muted."}

Mystery: The SS William B. Davock, a coal freighter built in 1907, sank to the bottom of Lake Michigan on its way to Chicago on November 11, 1940, during a ferocious storm. The reason for its sinking was unknown. Wreck: The ship sits upside down on the shore of Lake Michigan, 210 feet below the surface and just off the coast of Pentwater. Because of the way it sits and the murkiness of the water, investigations weren't possible. The Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA), a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization, were able to make their way down to the wreck on a clear day last fall. The dive allowed for the first-known footage of the ship to be taken. The footage, taken by MSRA diver Jeff Vos, of Holland, showed\u00a0a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade. 'The waves were so strong, they must have snapped the rudder's connection, at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller,' Vos told Michigan Live. 'With no power or steering, the Davock would have been at the mercy of the storm.' The Davock had little warning the storm was to hit on November 11, 1940. With 75 mph winds, 30-foot waves and rain turning to snow, it is still referred to as 'the most disastrous day in the history of Lake Michigan shipping'. Discovery: During a dive last fall, the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (MSRA), a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization were able to capture the first-ever footage of the wreck, determining a rudder the broke in the storm struck the propeller (pictured) Taking coal to Chicago, the Davock went down five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan. Another ship, cargo carrier the\u00a0SS Anna C. Minch, also went down, along with all 24 aboard, while several other ships were damaged and ran aground. MSRA board member, Craig Rich,\u00a0further explained what caused the Davock to sink. 'It would have sent the ship into what we call a shivering mode,' he told MLive. 'Without the rudder, it wouldn't have been able to steer and without the propeller working properly you can't drive it forward. 'The ship would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways which would have swamped the ship.' 'X' marks the spot: The shipwreck of the Davock\u00a0five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan. The freighter was en route to Chicago when it sank. The MSRA was motivated to delve deeper into investigating the Davock after the waters of Lake Michigan started to clear in recent years. 'We decided to give it a shot,' Rich said. \"The divers didn't even use a light for the discovery. 'It's not as warm as it is in the Caribbean, but it's certainly starting to rival it in clarity. 'It was a warm, sunny day. 'The ambient light was amazing.' The SS William B. Davock was a lake freighter that was constructed in 1907 by Great Lakes Engineering Works in St. Clair, Minnesota."}

For, rather than being festooned with smiling pictures of the tea party darling and talking up his hopes of'reigniting the promise of America', the page ribs him about two of his bugbears. The simple site has a black background and says, in large, grey text: 'SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA. IMMIGRATION REFORM NOW!' The presidential hopeful, who constantly castigates Obama and speaks out on border control, is using TedCruz.org\u00a0for his campaign instead. It is hardly the only such jibe internet users have made at Cruz's expense. TedCruzForAmerica.com\u00a0has been programmed to redirect users straight to healthcare.gov - the medical insurance exchange established by the President's Obamacare laws. The site seems especially apt given that Cruz today admitted that he himself is signing up for Obamacare, as he will no longer be covered by his wife's plan. A third snub comes in the form of TedCruz.ca, a site dedicated to reminding voters that Cruz, son to a Cuban father and American mother, was in fact born in Canada. His place of birth is not widely thought to rule him out as a presidential contender, but will still function as a stick for critics to beat him with.

{"abstract": "Anthropologist Pat Shipman of Pennsylvania State University has proposed a new theory that humans began taming and breeding wolves as early as 40,000 BC, giving them an advantage in hunting that led to the extinction of Neanderthals. This theory is based on the examination of 33,000-year-old fossils of dogs found in Siberia and Belgium, which showed signs of domestication. The theory is the latest in a long line of theories about our prehistoric ancestors, many of which contradict each other.", "article": "It's thousands of years since mankind won dominance over nature, and we're still pretty proud. But  a top researcher says we've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends. Humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 BC, it is claimed, giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our Neanderthal rivals. Man's best friend: An early cave painting in Libya of dogs chasing a deer in the Akakus Mountains. A new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought. Left behind: While early humans hunted with wolves, their Neanderthal rivals in Europe continued using primitive tools without any help, according to anthropologist Dr Pat Shipman (artist's impression) The controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist Pat Shipman of\u00a0Pennsylvania State University. She has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago, after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in Europe. No match: The theory claims Neanderthals (model pictured) were no match for the hunting technique. Instead, she said, humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from Africa up to 70,000 years ago. At the time, our close genetic relatives the Neanderthals were dominant in Europe, fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools. But soon afterwards the rival species died out, leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today's humans. Strong rival theories of their demise include that Neanderthals, just like woolly mammoths, were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters. Dr Shipman, however, told The Observer: 'We formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the Neanderthal. 'Early wolf-dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired. Then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows. 'This meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off \u2013 often the most dangerous part of a hunt \u2013 while humans didn\u2019t have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey. Dogs would have done that. 'Then we shared the meat. It was a win-win situation.' Dr Shipman's theory, shared in her book The Invaders: How Humans and Their Dogs Drove Neanderthals to Extinction, was partly inspired by early dog remains. Crossing paths: Wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia, but only wolves survived in the end. Close relation: A Natural History museum employee examines a model of a Neanderthal during an exhibition last year. Neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences. She examined 33,000-year-old fossils of dogs found in Siberia and Belgium, and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves. Although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today, there were clear signs of domestication, she said - including shorter snouts, densely-packed teeth and wider jaws. The theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors, many of which contradict each other. Last year a study at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany claimed early humans emigrated from Africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago. Another study at the University of Chicago said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all."}

Photographer Tupy, 35, says he feared his camera would melt from the overwhelming heat of the lava as he captured the daunting scenes of the\u00a0150-ft wide basalt volcano. 'The view is simply staggering,' said the 35-year-old.\u00a0'Lava inside the volcano is constantly moving, bubbling and bursting.' Scroll down for video. Mental images of the fiery depths of hell can't be far from these very real photographs of Ethiopia's Erta Ale. These incredible images by Czech photographer Karel Tupy capture the world's oldest continuously active lava lake. Lava sprays from the centre of the lake, a rare phenomenon said to be one of just six in the world. Lava illuminates, peeks through cracks and spits (left) and a haze forms above the blazing hot pool in shot by the adventurous 35-year-old. 'The heat was immense, when I got to an edge of the crater, it was unbearable. After couple of seconds, my facial skin was so hot, I had to get away. 'There was even a point where I was afraid my camera was going to melt.' Found in the badland desert area of the Afar Depression in north-eastern Ethiopia,\u00a0Erta Ale's famed lava lake formed around 1906 and is one of six in the world. The volcano's name translates in the local Afar tribe's language as'smoking mountain' while the pit to its south is known by locals as 'The Gateway to Hell', an appropriate moniker given the luminous lava spitting lava and searing heat. Karel Tupy said the view is'staggering', as lava inside the volcano is constantly moving, bubbling and bursting. Erta Ale's name translates as'smoking mountain' in the local Afar language while the pit to its south is called 'The Gateway to Hell' While locals aren't particularly welcoming to outsiders and the surrounding terrain is far from hospitable, tourists do make the journey to witness the natural phenomenon. In 2009, BBC TV show The Hottest Place On Earth went there to record a world first 3D laser image of the volcano.\u00a0Durham University earth scientist Dr Dougal Jerram and a team from the BBC explored the Danakil desert, officially known as the hottest place on Earth. 'Like a true journey to the centre of the Earth, volcanoes provide a unique window into our planet's interior,' he later wrote for BBC\u00a0News. 'Standing at the lip of the lava lake you can see why the locals see this as \"The Gateway to Hell\", as the incandescent bubbling lava lake hisses like some badly burned porridge cauldron, overturning and occasionally belching molten lava.' A visitor mounts his camera on a tripod in a bit to capture the volcano in its full glory while a small group of tourists line the other side. The ferocity of the volcano is clear as lava splashes up from a pool that is said to have formed around 1906. Having gained his own access to the area, in which five people in a group of scientists and tourists were killed while others were taken as hostages in a 2012 attack claimed by the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF), Tupy couldn't agree more with Dr Jerram's impression. 'Even though the lava is about 25 feet below the edge, sometimes during a burst the lake spits the lava outside the crater, so you have to be careful not to get hit by it,' he said. 'What you get hit by quite often though is fumes.' The photographer says while it's vital to avoid contact with lava, obviously, it's the fumes that can be the worry. Poor road access means the only way to efficiently get to the crater is via four-wheel-drive over rugged terrain. A far less dramatic sight, the lava forms a hard, grey layer when it is given the chance to cool. However, the environment gets far worse that what he experienced. In September 2005 an eruption killed 250 head of livestock and forced locals in the surrounding area to flee. There were further evacuations in August 2007 caused by lava flow, after which two people went missing. The most recent eruption came in November 2008. 'This place is something you don't see every day,' said Karel. 'As a photographer, I get to see amazing places and when you see that people like those photos. This is kind of a reward in itself.'"}

There were strong hopes that a women\u2019s team could still represent GB in Brazil in 2016 when the strength of the opposition for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland soon made it obvious that the men\u2019s initiative was a non-starter. Team GB are unlikely to reform for 2016 Olympics after coming together for London 2012. But the Celtic countries, having been promised that the two football sides at London 2012 were a one-off, have informed the FA that they see no reason to treat women\u2019s football any differently because it still threatens their independence \u2014 however many times they\u2019re reassured by FIFA that it won\u2019t. The FA will announce imminently that both Team GB football sides have been scrapped. Such are football\u2019s sensitive politics that after FIFA president Sepp Blatter had praised UEFA\u2019s work in his opening speech at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, the president of the European body, Michel Platini, left out his one dig at Blatter contained in advance copies of his speech. Michel Platini (right) seemed to bite his lip during his speech about Sepp Blatter's FIFA at the UEFA Congress. Platini, in an obvious nod to Blatter\u2019s regular references to steering the world football ship, was due to say: \u2018I regard myself as a simple team-mate, at most your captain. But not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm, clinging to the helm for dear life.\u2019 But he skipped the bit about \u2018clinging to the helm for dear life\u2019. Nothing sums up Blatter\u2019s presidential election trickery more than the decision to have a special meeting in Zurich to decide future numbers of World Cup places \u2014 the day after the Congress vote in May. This will allow Blatter at least to make promises about more World Cup places to the confederations who support him. FIFA say the issue has to be debated afterwards as candidate Luis Figo (right) has increasing World Cup participation as part of his manifesto. England return to Dublin for a friendly against Ireland after riots saw the last game abandoned in 1995. There is confidence England\u2019s powderkeg friendly against the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium on June 7 \u2014 the first time England have played in Dublin since a riot forced the abandonment in 1995 \u2014 will pass without trouble. All the focus in Ireland is on the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier with Scotland on June 13. No whitewash for Gill. There was no surprise about David Gill being elected British vice-president on the FIFA ExCo at the UEFA Congress on Tuesay. But FA of Wales\u2019 outspoken president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, who has made increasingly outlandish claims about FA skulduggery, received 10 votes out of 54 which is nine more than many expected. Meanwhile, Gill said that rather than ask \u2018awkward\u2019 questions of the Zurich regime which FA chairman Greg Dyke wants him to do, he will be putting \u2018relevant and appropriate\u2019 ones. Luis Figo (left) and the more impressive Michael van Praag are unlikely to oust Blatter as FIFA president. The worry for all three UEFA-endorsed rivals for Blatter\u2019s crown \u2014 Prince Ali of Jordan, Holland\u2019s Michael Van Praag and Portugal\u2019s Luis Figo \u2014 is that the FIFA president still enjoys backing in Europe. Estonia football president Aivar Pohlak claims as many as half of UEFA delegates could back Blatter. That seems unlikely but at least 15 out of 54 countries could. Meanwhile, Van Praag was easily the most impressive of the three challengers when they were given the Congress floor. FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s demand for radical changes in top-flight clubs\u2019 25-man squads to ensure young English players get more game time has irritated the Premier League. Dyke said: \u2018We\u2019re open to discussions and I\u2019d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.\u2019 FA chief Greg Dyke has angered Premier League clubs with his plans for more home-grown players. There could now be tension between Dyke and the PL at the clubs\u2019 summit on Thursday, particularly given Dyke was last week advised not to go public by the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board. But the extent to which Wembley were determined to get maximum publicity for Dyke\u2019s proposals was shown by them bringing in expensive PR firm Milltown Partners to lobby media to attend the press briefing. It was also held at the start of international week so the PL could have no complaints about it deflecting attention from their competition."}

Fred Nelis, 60, of Holland, got a new heart, while 67-year-old Gordon Veldman of Pentwater, got a new pair of lungs. The operations were held at the exact same time at a Grand Rapids hospital last June. Nelis and Veldman have been close friends for over a decade, however their transplants were completely coincidental. Incredible bond: Gordon Veldman and Fred Nelis have been friends for over a decade, but now consider themselves 'organ brothers' after each received a transplant from the same donor last June, saving their lives. Lifesaving operation: Fred Nelis, 60, underwent a heart transplant after living with\u00a0idiopathic cardiomyopathy for the last 20 years. On-the-mend: Gordon Veldman, 67, received a lung transplant to escape a genetic disease that reduced his lung capacity to 15 percent last year. The medical director of the heart and lung transplant program at Spectrum Health says it was the program's first simultaneous friend-transplant that he's aware of. 'It's pretty wild,'\u00a0Dr. Michael Dickinson told The Grand Rapids Press. 'We thought it was quite a remarkable story when it happened. 'It's nice for us because it kind of shows the growth of the program - that we were able to help both of these two friends right here in West Michigan.' Both men suffered from chronic conditions that caused their health to rapidly deteriorate before their transplants. Nelis has been suffering for 20 years with idiopathic cardiomyopathy - a progressive heart disease with an unknown cause. Then in 2013 he developed atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, and was placed on the heart transplant in March 2014. 'Organ brothers': Godron Veldman (left) and Fred Nelis (right) say they now put their heart and lungs together each time they see each other to show how thankful they are for their transplants. Veldman has a genetic disease called Alpha-1, which would potentially destroy his lungs, and caused him to develop emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One year ago his lung capacity fell to 15 percent, making everyday talks like walking incredibly difficult. 'The end was very near,' he said. 'I probably had two months left.' Then on June 18, 2014, both men received a call - the wait was over. They were both admitted to Spectrum Health and underwent transplants, with Nelis getting a new heart and Veldman new lungs. New lease on life: Fred Nelis was a competitive swimmer for 40 years, before developing heart issues. Both have rebounded since the operations. The men known little about their 32-year-old donor, however were able to send a letter to the man's family through Gift of Life Michigan. Veldman said\u00a0that he and Nelis put their new heart and lungs as close as they can every time they meet. 'We got a gift, and it's best that we treat it as such,' Nelis said.

Malachi Lindo, 27, repeatedly bludgeoned 51 year-old  Phillip Steels in the street after taking the ecstasy clone Ethylone. The attack was so savage that when Mr Steels was discovered, lying in a pool of blood on the footpath, his face had been damaged beyond recognition and there was a gaping hole in the side of his head. Charity worker Phillip Steels (right) was repeatedly bludgeoned to death by Malachi Lindo (left) Psychiatrist Dr Ian Cumming told the court that Lindo was either suffering from drug induced psychosis or paranoid schizophrenia and concluded that Ethylone intensified the symptoms of mental illness. Ethylone is one of dozens of synthetic narcotics that have flooded the UK over the last decade. The most famous, mephedrone or meow meow, was implicated in a series of deaths across the UK which led to the law being changed in 2010 to categorise the drugs as Class B. Lindo said he could not remember the attack but told psychiatrists he believed he could pass through other dimensions. He admitted manslaughter, but an Old Bailey jury took 11 hours and 31 minutes to find Lindo guilty of murder by a majority of ten to one. Lindo showed no emotion as the verdict was read out, but paused briefly to look up at family members in the public gallery as he was taken down. Judge Paul Worsley QC told him: \u2018As you know the sentence must be one of life imprisonment.\u2019 The judge remanded Lindo in custody to be sentenced on Monday. Mr Steels was found lying in a pool of blood on the footpath. He had a large hole in the left side of his head and his face was damaged beyond recognition (collect picture) The Old Bailey heard Lindo and Mr Steels did not know each other before their chance meeting in Green Street, Enfield in London, in the early hours of 4 September 2014. Mr Steels, originally from Sligo, Ireland, was walking home after leaving a friend\u2019s house at 1.30am when Lindo launched his attack. CCTV cameras captured part of the struggle as Mr Steels was knocked to the ground and hit repeatedly. Police were called to the scene at 1.38am after a passing motorist spotted the victim and reported a road traffic accident. Officers also spotted Lindo rolling about in the middle of the road about 50 yards away and ordered him to kneel on the ground before putting him in handcuffs. Lindo shouted: \u2018Take me to heaven, kill me now, I want to die,\u2019 and added \u2018I\u2019m not going to kill anyone else.\u2019 He also asked the police to let him go home, adding: \u2018I promise I won\u2019t kill again.\u2019 Lindo told officers he had taken cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis and added: \u2018I\u2019m a psychopath, I\u2019m a psychic and I\u2019ve got AIDS.\u2019 Mephedrone, a legal high, known as meow meow, white magic, drone, bubble and MCAT, which was legal until April 2010. Blood tests later revealed traces of THC, the active component of cannabis, and Ethylone. Police found skunk cannabis, MDEA and methylenedioxymethylcathinone concealed inside Lynx aerosols and other containers in Lindo\u2019s bag. Prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC told the court Mr Steels\u2019 death was \u2018wholly unnecessary.\u2019 Lindo, of Bowles Green, Enfield, admitted manslaughter but denied murder.\u00a0He was convicted of a single count of murder. Over the past five years there has been an\u00a0unprecedented increase in the number, type and availability of new psychoactive substances in Europe, with 101 new substances reported in 2014 alone. Yesterday, the government banned two groups of dangerous \u2018legal highs\u2019. The stimulant compound drug 4,4\u2019-DMAR, which is linked to the deaths of more than 20 people in the UK, mainly Northern Ireland, and the synthetic opioid MT-45, have both been outlawed as Class A substances. The move is part of a crackdown on new psychoactive substances (NPS) \u2013 known as \u2018legal highs\u2019- and minister have already banned more than 500 new drugs.

Alexandre and Ronaldo Antunes had a special birthday party at the Tufts Medical Center on Thursday while gathered with the staff who helped their family during their births last March. The oldest by nearly a month, Alexandre, was born prematurely on March 2 followed by the arrival of his twin brother on March 26. Scroll down for video. Alexandre (left) and Ronaldo (right) Antunes had a special birthday party at the Tufts Medical Center on Thursday while gathered with the staff who helped their family during their births last March. Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva, the boys' mother, held back tears as she thanked the doctors and staff for their work during her pregnancy while at the party on Thursday at Tufts Medical Center. Dr Jonathan Davis (center), chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had never seen delayed interval delivery this successful. Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva, the boys' mother, went into labor 16 weeks early last February and had a delayed interval delivery, which is rare. She held back tears as she thanked the doctors and staff for their work, according to\u00a0CBS Boston. 'One year later we are here celebrating,' said Ronaldo Antunes, the boys' father. 'It looks like it was yesterday. It's unbelievable. Grateful to be here celebrating their first year.' Nurse JoAnn Loiselle said: 'To see them [Alexandre and Ronaldo] going from tiny and fighting for their lives to thriving with what looks like no deficits is almost a miracle. Dr Jonathan Davis, chief of Newborn Medicine at the hospital, said he had seen 'exceptionally rare' delivery attempted several times, but that it was never quite successful. He said: 'It's the first time in my career I've seen it this successful. I've seen it attempted a number of times and it was never quite successful, and in this case it made a huge difference.' Alexandre and Ronaldo were to be Pinheiro da Silva's first children with Ronaldo, and she was thrilled to be pregnant with twins. Ronaldo Antunes (above with son Ronaldo), the boys' father, said he is grateful to be celebrating his sons' first year. Lindalva  (pictured with her husband, Ronaldo, and twin babies) was just 24 weeks pregnant when she went into labor. Her twins beat all odds by being born 24 days apart in a rare procedure. But when her water broke in February, the excitement turned to fear. 'I panicked,' Pinheiro da Silva told\u00a0ABC. 'It wasn't time. It was too early. I knew I could lose the babies.' Lindalva gave birth to premature Alexandre, who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, as doctors were able to keep Ronaldo growing inside of his mother's womb during the unique technique. Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are doing well. Pinheiro da Silva has spoken out about the technique doctors resorted to in the hope they could save one twin when the first was born at only 24 weeks after she went into premature labor in February. She gave birth to premature Alexandre, who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit, as doctors kept Ronaldo growing inside of his mother's womb during the unique technique. Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are doing well. When potassium sulfate injections failed to stop Pinheiro da Silva's labor, doctors decided to go forward with a rare technique in which one baby is kept in the womb after its twin is born. 'When you have a situation where one baby is born and labor stops, you are given this window of opportunity,' Dr. Steven Ralston, director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the Globe. 'But it's a rare window. Most times, labor does not stop.' Thankfully, after Alexandre was born at just 1 pound, 10 ounces, it did happen. Doctors stopped Pinheiro da Silva's labor and left the delivered child's umbilical cord and placenta inside her womb. Pinheiro da Silva's first twin Alexandre was born at just 24 weeks and weighed only 1 pound 10 ounces. As Alexandre fought for his life, his brother Ronaldo lived on in their mother's womb growing stronger. Ronaldo was born 24 days after his brother and weighed 3 pounds 3 ounces. 'On the. second day after Alexandre was born, his umbilical cord came out,' Pinheiro da Silva told ABC. Her husband Ronaldo'saw it hanging.' 'But they just cleaned it and put it back inside,' she said. Pinheiro da Silva was given antibiotics to combat infection, which can be common. after the procedure. However, unlike many mothers, da"}

Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave Scientology in 2007 after almost taking his own life, and has now been forced to live on the run. 'It's psychological warfare and after a while it gets to you,' he said of being a member of the polarizing religion. 'Things got so bad that I tried to jump off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2007, trying to kill myself.' He spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident, and that is when he finally left the church. Scroll down for video. The nephew of John Travolta (above with wife Kelly Preston) has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the Church of Scientology. Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave the Church of Scientology (above) after he tried to take his own life, at which point members began mouthing to hi, 'You are dead' Speaking with The National Enquirer, Sam did however say that his famous uncle did everything he could to help him, but even he could not stop the attacks that were waged against him after his decision to leave. 'Planting drugs on me' and'spreading rumors around town that I was psychotic, and even worse - a pedophile,' are just two of the ways Sam claims members of the church tried to bring him down after his decision to leave Scientology. ''My uncle told me, \"Sorry, Sam, I can't help you. They don't care who I am.\"' His uncle does however supply Sam with a monthly allowance, which is greatly appreciated by the struggling screenwriter. Sam also says in the interview that Travolta has never pressured members of his family into joining Scientology, though he does say he would be 'friendlier' to those individuals who were members of the church. The other claim Sam makes against the church, and one that has been brought up frequently by former members, is the amount of work required of members for little to no pay. Sam claims he worked as a file clerk,'making $36 for a 60-hour week.' Then, there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church. Sam, claims they 'would mouth to me, \"You are dead,\" over and over again. It was all about mental control for them.' The 47-year-old says he has moved on now that the attacks have stopped, and he is finally trying to get his life back on track. Sam's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church, with the HBO documentary Going Clear set to premiere later this month. The film takes a look at the religion, and how its treatment of A-list members like Tom Cruise and Travolta, differs from others in the church. It is based on the book of the same name, which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013, and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church. John Travolta's lawyer has denied the claims made by his nephew in this interview."}

This proves to an extent that Real are more reliant on the goals of Ronaldo than Barcelona are on the goals of Messi.", "article": "Ever wondered what the football world would be like without Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? Well naturally we'd miss their stunning goals and dazzling trickery, but it seems erasing them would shake up the order of things in Spain. Stats gurus Opta have calculated what the La Liga table would look like if the goals of the divine duo were taken away - and there's quite a dramatic change at the top. La Liga would look very different if the goals of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were taken away. The deadly duo have scored 57 goals between them in La Liga alone this season - Ronaldo 30, Messi 27. Real Madrid currently enjoy a two-point advantage over their rivals Barcelona in the La Liga standings. How the La Liga table would look if goals by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were taken away (Opta) In real life, Real Madrid currently enjoy a two-point advantage over their Clasico rivals, thanks in no small part to the 30 league goals of Ronaldo this season. But if they and Messi's contribution of 27 goals were subtracted, it's Barcelona who would enjoy a slender one-point advantage at the summit. Opta went through every match this season in which Messi and Ronaldo have scored and took away their goals from the final score. Ronaldo celebrates his goal in Real Madrid's 1-1 home draw with Villarreal at the weekend. The Portuguese was also on target in Real's 2-0 victory at Elche last month. Ronaldo celebrates one of his hat-trick of goals in Real's 3-0 home win over Celta Vigo in December. With Messi, Barcelona would still win all but one of the matches in which he has scored. That is the 3-2 home win over Villarreal last month, which would end in a draw. But taking away Ronaldo's goals affects Real's season more dramatically. The Portuguese scored four in the 5-1 home win over Elche, meaning they would only draw 1-1. Lionel Messi claims the match ball after his hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-1 rout of neighbours Espanyol. Messi's 27 league goals this season have seen him surpass the all-time La Liga scoring record. Messi celebrates with team-mates Pedro and Marc Bartra after scoring in the 5-0 rout of Levante last month. Removing his hat-trick against Celta Vigo would see them claim one point rather than three, and subtracting his goal against Villarreal last weekend means they would lose instead of draw. It does prove to an extent that Real are more reliant on the goals of Ronaldo than Barcelona are on the goals of Messi. But in such a nip and tuck title race, who's to say that won't change again by the end of the season. Cristiano Ronaldo's La Liga goals 2014-15. Lionel Messi's La Liga goals 2014-15."}
{"abstract": "The TSA has an Instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints, including eels, knives, grenades, seal bombs, medieval mace, brass knuckles, snakes, and swords. All of these items are prohibited from both carry-on and checked luggage, with the exception of freshly-baked pies. Passengers are encouraged to check any bladed objects into their checked luggage, as they are not allowed on board.", "article": "The worst thing most people will get caught carrying at security is a bottle of water, but there are some passengers who attempt to sneak some dangerous and very bizarre items onto planes. The TSA (Transport Security Administration) has its own Instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing. From passengers travelling with their beloved eels, to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places, the TSA shares it all with its 238,000 followers. Though potentially harmless, this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals, the TSA says. Discovered in a carry-on bag at the Eagle County Regional Airport in Colorado, it's hard to know what this odd-looking creature is. While it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy, TSA agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item. Grenades, whether inactive or otherwise, are prohibited in any carry-on or checked luggage. Another item to leave out of your hand luggage? Seal bombs, like those discovered in a passenger's carry-on bag in Seattle's Tacoma International Airport. A seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas, but, unfortunately, what this traveller didn't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry-on and checked baggage. Seal bombs, used for fishing, are prohibited from both carry-on and checked luggage. One of the oddest items that MailOnline came across while browsing the TSA Instagram was definitely a medieval mace, which was discovered in a carry-on bag at Chicago's Midway International Airport. Similarly dangerous, a pair of cat-shaped brass knuckles were seized at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. While they may look like a key chain at first glance, these feline-inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board. One of the strangest confiscated items? A medieval mace, found at Chicago's Midway International Airport. These cat-shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported. In 2012, officers seized a bag of live eels, which they found in a passenger's checked luggage in Miami. Officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012. Found in a passenger's checked bag at the Miami International Airport, the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to Maracaibo, Venezuela. However, instead of arguing with security, the passenger, smartly, opted to surrender all items to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Seven small snakes were also discovered in Miami in 2011, after being stuffed down a traveller's trousers in nylon stockings. The snakes were found using TSA's Advanced Imaging Technology, which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight. The passenger was later arrested and charged. And yet another animal-based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a Scooby Doo greeting card, despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry-on bags. A Scooby Doo greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife. Also in Miami in 2011, a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes, in nylon stockings, in their trousers. Swords, though fine to check, cannot be brought on board an airplane as a carry-on item. This Jack the Ripper-like sickle was seized from a passenger's bag because no blades are allowed on board. Throwing stars, which are used in martial arts, are banned in some American states but not others. Interestingly, one item travellers can bring through security: a freshly-baked pie, like this one. From swords and a Jack the Ripper-like sickle to throwing stars, all bladed objects are prohibited from carry-on bags - but that hasn't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint. But don't worry, even swords can be taken to your destination in a checked suitcase. Interestingly, however, you are allowed to bring baked goods through security, such as this pecan pie."}

The forwards have worked tirelessly all campaign for us and there\u2019s pressure on the backs now to take opportunities.\u2019 If Wales can rack up the points, the pressure will move on to Ireland and England, who are up second and third against Scotland and France in the afternoon of staggered fixtures. Davies and his countrymen will watch events unfold from Rome and he plans to cheer on his French clubmates from Clermont Auvergne. Italy's captain and talisman\u00a0Sergio Parisse faces a race to fit for the visit of Wales on Saturday. \u2018France can be amazing at times,\u2019 said Davies. \u2018Hopefully, they can turn up and do a job. They\u2019ve done it in the past.\u2019 Aside from two injury-enforced changes in the front row, Gatland has kept faith with the starting XV who beat Ireland.

The beloved dog died days after returning from the Crufts show in Birmingham, sparking an international murder mystery and claims he was'murdered' by a bitter rival. And just as toxicology reports this week showed he had died after ingesting a fast-acting illegal pesticide, residents of his hometown of Lauw, Belgium, have revealed the small village is in the grip of a suspected serial cat killer. Scroll down for video. It was revealed two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran- were to blame for Jagger's death, while residents in his hometown have revealed their fears they are in the grip of a serial cat killer. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Lauw, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. His devastated owner Aleksandra Lauwers, 34, was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone. However, toxicology reports released this week suggested he must have ingested it at his home in Belgium as the poison discovered in his system is notoriously fast-acting. Now locals have claimed ten dead cats have been found in the past two months alone. One resident, Els van Marsenille, claimed she had lost three since January and her neighbour two, according to David Sanderson, reporting for\u00a0The Times. Local Linda Jans said she was now too scared to take her dogs out for walks in the village, claiming a pet killer unhappy about dogs' barking could operate quickly by simply throwing poison out into the streets and parks. Prize-winning Irish Setter Jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of Belgium. Local\u00a0veterinarian Patrick Jans, (unrelated to Ms Jans), said he was waiting on toxicology reports to reveal what killed the local cats, but said there were'symptoms suggestive of intoxication'. Their claims are backed up by the evidence -\u00a0Caroline Kisko, secretary for the Kennel Club which organises Crufts, said this week two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for Jagger's death. 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death. 'We have had confirmation, including from independent toxicologists, that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting. 'Severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours. 'Considering we are told that Jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, late on Friday March 6 night, leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention, we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday March 5, some 28 to 36 hours earlier.' The family's vet Dr Patrick Jans reiterated this - telling the Mail Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died. 'I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it's unlikely because of the long time delay. I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.' Aleksandra Lauwers (pictured with her son Jeremy and the litter Jagger was born part of) said they were struggling to cope with the dog's death."}

The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature called 'Emma's Beauty Tips', which suggested that young girls who are'ready to change up their looks' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape. 'You, yes you, are beautiful, but if you're ready to change up your look, read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face,' the article reads. Outrage: This 'beauty tips' feature in the March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine has caused fury among parents. The feature then lists five different face shapes, from 'heart faces' to 'oval faces', suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape. And while those with heart-shaped faces are advised to choose 'long, curly layers and thinned out curls' in order to accentuate their 'angular cheeks', those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to 'have almost any style haircut' because 'almost everything looks great on this face shape'. Unsurprisingly, the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother, Cleveland-based writer Sharon Holbrook, writing a piece for the New York Times slamming the magazine's 'insulting' feature. '[My daughter] is seven,' she wrote. 'My little girl, the shape of her face, and whether her haircut is flattering are none of Lego\u2019s concern,' \u00a0It wasn\u2019t even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it.' Mrs Holbrook goes on to quote from the Lego Friends website, which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are, she writes, 'far too young' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to'soften the edges' of their faces. Unnecessary: The 'overtly girly' Lego Friends line, including this\u00a0Heartlake Hair Salon, has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional Lego models. Calling for change: Writer Sharon Holbrook (pictured) wrote a piece about the Lego feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape. The online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media, with parents across the country calling for Lego to abandon its'sexist' marketing campaigns and 'overtly girly' toy ranges in favor of returning to the 'powerful messages' it once offered to \u00a0young girls who were so eager to play with their products. 'Go back to this [message] of 1981 instead of \"beauty tips for 5-12 year-olds\" c**p,' one person wrote on Twitter, alongside a picture of a 30-year-old Lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to 'build for fun'. Another added: 'Nonononono. Damn it, LEGO. Girls don't need another source of beauty tips, let alone from you.' One parent went as far as to say she would boycott Lego until the brand does something to address its'sexist' campaigns, tweeting: 'Hey @LEGO_Group, your sexism is getting out of control. I\u2019m buying @Tegu blocks until you check it (sic).' 'The ultra-girly Lego Friends line caused a flap from the beginning,\u00a0and I wasn\u2019t at all sure whether I liked it,' Mrs Holbrook added. 'Why can\u2019t girls and boys both play with traditional Legos? When I was little, Lego used to even market them to all children, magnificently so...' Go back: Parents are calling for Lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls, such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981. Fury: Many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly'sexist' Lego Friends line.

'I used to hate dating and think I'd have to settle for just anybody, but I don't feel that way anymore,' she said. 'The most important change is I accept myself.' Michelle noted that although she still has excess skin on her arms and legs, she is finally happy with herself. But getting to this point was far from easy for Michelle, who had tried almost everything to control her weight. Before she was diagnosed with PCOS in her senior year of high school, Michelle had rapidly put on pounds and was starting to lose her hair. Big smile: Michelle can be seen snapping an action selfie during her most recent race. More confident: Michelle said she has gained her confidence back after her weightloss transformation. PCOS made her insulin-resistant, so it was nearly impossible for her to lose weight. She was given various medications and shots - including prescription diet pills - but nothing worked. Michelle eventually hired a personal trainer and followed a strict diet plan that was created for her by a nutritionist. She managed to lose 120lbs over the course of a year, but working out two hours per day and living on a diet of only vegetables and protein left her with little to no social life. When the weight slowly crept back onto her frame, she finally considered lap band surgery, which is intended to reduce the quantity of food consumed. The procedure involves an inflatable device being placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch, essentially shrinking stomach capacity. Amazing fete: Michelle posed in a black dress (L) before she lost 115lbs and 42.5 inches off her frame (R) Personal win: Michelle can be seen holding the medal she received after she completed the New York City Half Marathon. Michelle noted that she didn't want people to think she had 'taken the easy way out', but she quickly learned it was a 'tool, not a miracle'. She still had to learn how to control her portions and make healthy choices, while maintaining a regular workout schedule. Michelle proudly showed her fifth grade students her completion medal after she completed her first half marathon. And when one of her students congratulated her for winning the race, Michelle didn't correct her, explaining that, in a way, she felt like she had won after overcoming such adversity in order to achieve her goals."}

She blames the parents for the children's weight problems and believes that people in England are too soft on 'fat shaming'. The controversial columnist has form with insulting overweight people, as seen in her documentary Making My Fat, where she gained and lost four stone to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight.", "article": "Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot. Overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter Katie Hopkins. The controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight. Writing in her column for Now! magazine, the 39-year-old said: 'The most upsetting thing of all is a fat child. 'Watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle.' The mother-of-three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems: 'I've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent. 'The fat kids go through the school gates and there's the fat mum in the car, who doesn't bother to get out, still wearing her pyjamas...and that really does my head in.' Citing government statistics that say one-in-10 four-year-olds are now overweight, the Celebrity Big Brother star even goes as far to say that, if she had her way, fat children would be'sent to special sports schools until they make the grade.' Hopkins also opines that she thinks people in England are far too soft on 'fat shaming'. 'There's loads of fat kids and we don't say anything because that would be fat-shaming, or bullying...well, I disagree completely. 'In England, we're far too soft on it and we seem to think it's okay that people are pureeing KFC to spoon-feed to their babies.' Earlier this year, the opinionated former Apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight. Katie has form with insulting overweight people. On her television show Making My Fat, she was kicked out of an 800lb woman's house after rows. Now, she's turned her venom to children, saying obese kids should go to'special sports schools' until they make the grade' Katie before her own weight gain (left) and after (right) In the programme, Katie was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape, but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight. She loaded up on junk food every couple of hours, setting herself a target of 5,000 calories every day. Katie's doctor advised her not to go through with the programme, warning the star that she faced a number of health problems including liver strain, damaged knees, altered blood chemistry, and stretched skin among other issues. But she persisted with the\u00a0experiment, going so far as to travel to North Carolina in the US to take part in an eating\u00a0competition. Katie reveals she had to sleep next to a sick bucket  because overeating made her feel so nauseous. At the fast food restaurant, customers are given 20 minutes to consume a monster burger, containing a kilo of meat and 8,000 calories. Katie gave the meal her best shot, but only succeeded in consuming around half. She said: 'There are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds (14.2 stone) and 300 pounds (21 stone) each. 'I can't understand why no one is telling them to stop. 'I feel really sorry for those children. Their parents were just there watching them eat. 'I just want to go and ask them to stop. 'I couldn't do that to my children. I could never feed my children to death.' Katie also visited an American called Nicky, a woman who weighs 803lb (57 stone). Nicky is often confined to her house because of the weight that she carries around. While the women initially got on like a house on fire, Katie quickly insulted Nicky and the women became embroiled in an argument, which saw her asked to leave the house. The TV star was unrepentant, telling the cameras: 'There is no way she is really happy. 'She has managed to become happy with what she has got by accepting it's rubbish. 'I would rather be put down than be Nicky.' Making My Fat followed Katie Hopkins as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise. The end of the programme saw Katie engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight, gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours. Katie Hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the UK - she recently came second in a poll of the world's most hated people. The television star's documentary made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her. She told FEMAIL: 'Fat people can be quite afraid of me, there is this sort of Hopkins fear. 'A lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they"}
{"abstract": "Rand Paul's goal to run for two offices in 2016 was given the green light by the Kentucky GOP, who voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee to decide the rules and regulations of a caucus. Paul has pledged to raise money to help offset the costs of the caucus, and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has expressed concern about potential chaos in the electoral process. She has called on the Republican Party of Kentucky to provide details on how all their voters would be able to participate.", "article": "(CNN)Rand Paul's goal to run for two offices in 2016 cleared a hurdle Saturday after the Kentucky GOP decided to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary. The plan allows the first-term U.S. senator, who's running for re-election and making a likely bid for president, to get around a Kentucky law that prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot twice. Rand Paul searches for green light on caucus proposal. After Paul met with the party's 54-member executive committee in Bowling Green for a two-hour session, the group voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee that would decide the rules and regulations of how a caucus would be held. The final vote would come in August when a larger gathering of the Kentucky GOP is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force. \"We thank the members of RPK for their unanimous support and look forward to continuing this process,\" said Paul's top adviser, Doug Stafford, in a statement. Kentucky law allows the state party to determine the details of its presidential preference vote, but not the primary for other elected offices in the state. In other words, Paul's name for his Senate re-election bid would still remain on the May 2016 primary ballot, but the presidential vote would likely move up earlier in the year to March. The senator appeared at the meeting to address some concerns about a caucus, namely the increased cost, as well as the lower voter turnout typically associated with caucuses. He has pledged to raise money through his donor network to help offset the costs, and proponents of the caucus argue that the significant media attention expected and Kentucky's earlier placement in the nominating calendar would spur just as much turnout. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, issued a scathing statement Saturday, saying a Republican caucus next year \"could create potential chaos in our electoral process\" and promised to \"monitor the situation\" in the coming months. \"In the meantime, I call on the Republican Party of Kentucky to provide details on how all their voters would be able to participate and how the party intends to uphold the integrity of the process,\" she said."}
{"abstract": "The article criticizes Ian Ritchie for undermining the progress of England's head coach Stuart Lancaster and the team by making a statement that finishing second in the Six Nations is unacceptable. The author argues that Ritchie's words are a massive own goal and could be seen as a sign of weakness by the opposition. The article concludes that Ritchie should be backing Lancaster ahead of the World Cup in September and that everyone should be feeling positive after the brilliant display against France.", "article": "I just cannot understand why Ian Ritchie has made such a statement. The first thing that surprises me is the timing, following one of the most exciting days ever in Five and Six Nations history. England\u2019s victory over France was brilliant to watch, even if they did fall just short of winning the title. Twickenham was rocking and it was an amazing advert for the game ahead of a home World Cup. I\u2019m in Switzerland at present and on the flight the pilot, air stewardesses and all the passengers were talking about Saturday and their real optimism for the World Cup. So for Ritchie to say finishing second is unacceptable just flattens the mood. It doesn\u2019t seem right and is a massive own goal. Stuart Lancaster (second left) consoles his players  after falling six points short of a Six Nations title. England captain Chris Robshaw (left) and his team-mates came second for the fourth year in succession. Ben Youngs celebrate his try during England's storming 55-35 Six Nations victory against France. More importantly, his words undermine Stuart Lancaster. I would go as far as to say he has belittled much of the progress that Lancaster and the team have achieved. If this had happened to me, I would be in Ritchie\u2019s office demanding an explanation. This is professional sport and being a head coach is a tough position. The moment someone says something, the opposition see a chink, a weakness, and try to drive a wedge through it. It\u2019s one thing to say these things in private, as professional sport is about winning, but to say them in public is wrong. If Lancaster has called the result unacceptable, fair enough, but Ritchie has no qualifications to talk about the team\u2019s performance. This year is all about preparing for the World Cup and England put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style. The atmosphere at Twickenham for England's final Six Nations match was electric from start to finish. This was the time for a pat on the back and a united front. Ian Ritchie appointed Stuart Lancaster after an interim period, which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches. He appointed an inexperienced coach in Lancaster yet later awarded him a six-year contract. If the priority was short-term gains, he should have been given a one-year contract. Coming in with no international coaching experience, Lancaster has done a very good job. Wales and Ireland are very strong teams too so to think you can just win Grand Slams and championships is very naive and just brings back the tag that the English are arrogant. Ian Ritchie (right) should be backing Lancaster ahead of the eagerly-anticipated World Cup in September. I\u2019m sure Ritchie had good intentions, perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss. But he will regret what he said as England are in a very good position. If England are going to win the World Cup, they have to have everybody together as one team, everybody\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys. We should all be feeling positive after such a brilliant display against France and looking forward to the World Cup. It\u2019s all positive."}

The first known works by one of Britain's finest composers, Sir Hubert Parry, who wrote the music for Jerusalem, are being sold at auction. The 70 documents, expected to fetch up to \u00a350,000, represent Parry's earliest surviving work and include pieces written when he was an Eton schoolboy and at Oxford. Many of the pieces have never been played in public, but a premiere before the Prince of Wales, a champion of Parry's music, is to take place in May. Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance. As well as Jersualem, he wrote many famous settings for English hymns, including Repton, a well-known tune for Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind. Parry's setting of the anthem I Was Glad has been played at the Coronations of every Monarch since Edward VII and was performed at the Westminster Abbey wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. In a BBC4 documentary about Parry's music, Charles said: 'It gives you tingles up the spine and tears in your eyes.' Parry's version of The Magnificat And Nunc Dimittis In D, and an anthem entitled O Sing Unto The Lord, are considered the best of the cache and will be sung for the first time by the choir at Gloucester Cathedral. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19. It is an appropriate venue because Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848-1918) grew up just two miles from Gloucester, where he learned to play the organ. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19. Adrian Partington, the cathedral's director of music, who examined all the manuscripts and chose the two pieces for the premiere, said: 'The pieces are beautifully well-written for his age and show a talented young composer, but they are not exceptional. I think he was writing stuff for his chums to perform at Eton and Oxford and he did it in a hurry. 'They were probably only performed informally around the piano and I suspect he just forgot about them, which is why they have been gathering dust for all these years. 'But the seeds of a great composition like Jerusalem can be found in this student work. These are beautifully shaped tunes, logical harmony and very exact but imaginative setting of the words.' Some are incomplete or jottings, but there are some important compositions which until recently were kept in storage by one of Parry's distant relatives. In later life, Parry went on to teach and later run the Royal College of Music in London, which has an archive of his work. Dr Peter Horton, a librarian at the college, said: 'The new documents are interesting because they are his early works and one can see from them how Parry's work developed.'"}

Messages from the first Brit to be killed fighting ISIS have revealed frustration at the Kurds' lack of discipline - and his fear the 'Corps' would tell his mother he had gone to Syria. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, who died while fighting against the terror group with the Kurdistan People's Protection Units (YPG), kept his friends updated through Facebook after heading to war-torn Syria in December. The former Royal Marine's posts and messages give a glimpse of day-to-day life for those fighting ISIS, advises interested friends on how to join up and reveals the Kurdish fighters lack of discipline, but huge determination. But it seems he was most worried about his mother finding out where he was. The messages, published by The Sun, reveal Mr Scurfield began looking for a way to get out to Syria to join up with the YPG at least a month before he arrived in Syria. He was recruited by the Lions of Rojava, and by November 3 had clear plans in place for reaching their base in Syria. On December 6, using a Facebook account set up under a fake name so his friends could keep in touch, he messages to say he has arrived safely in Syria, and met up with two other foreign fighters. But his parents still apparently had no idea where he was - with Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, revealing on December 15: 'I've heard about the authorities threatening to tell my parents!' It is thought the 25-year-old told his friends he was going to do humanitarian work in the war-torn country last year after being 'horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS'. It is unclear what Mr Scurfield told his parents,  archaeologists Chris and Vicci. Mr Scurfield (pictured kneeling, centre) revealed foreign fighters frustration with the Kurds lack of discipline, but also recorded how impressed he was with their attitude. Eventually, it seems the Royal Marines did take matters into their own hands, informing his parents sometime between Christmas and January 5. In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine,\u00a0revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.' The messages and posts also give an idea of what foreign fighters heading for Syria to fight with the YPG can expect. Mr Scurfield revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds''skills and drills'.

Lisa Blake, 41, spent six years and \u00a37,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner Stephen, 37, both suffer from unexplained fertility problems. After a fourth round of IVF failed, the couple, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor. Seeing how desperate they were to become parents, Miss Blake's younger sister, Julie Wealand, 35, offered to donate her own eggs. And finally, in December 2013, Miss Blake became pregnant. She gave birth to healthy twin baby boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 months, in July last year. Lisa Blake, 41, gave birth to healthy twin boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 month, in July 2014. Miss Blake said: 'I was so happy to discover that I was finally pregnant. 'Julie has given me the best gift I could ask for, I'll be forever grateful.' The couple's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby. Miss Blake, who has been in a relationship with Stephen for 15 years, said: 'We started trying for baby when I was 34, but after two years we realised something was wrong. 'Doctors couldn't explain my fertility problems - I just couldn't get pregnant. My sister had also struggled to conceive so I knew my age wasn't to blame. 'Growing up, I always dreamed of having at least two children, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be a mum. 'My friends have kids, most from when they were younger, so I only had to attend one baby shower. But when I saw people with children, I wished it would be me.' Aged 36, she turned to IVF treatment in an attempt to conceive. But three agonising years and three failed IVF attempts later, the pair were still childless. Meanwhile her sister Mrs Wealand, who lives in California with her husband, gave birth to two children of her own, conceived through IVF treatment. Miss Blake said: 'I was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant. Even though she lives abroad, we're really close and I loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew. 'But I still longed for a child so Stephen and I pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of IVF. 'Adopting would have been our final chance for children because we couldn't afford to pay for more treatments.' Miss Blake (right) had been trying to conceive for six years, and had spent \u00a37,000 on IVF treatment. She was only able to have children when her sister, Julie Wealand, 35, (left), donated her eggs. Miss Blake became pregnant in December 2013, and gave birth to twins Joshua and Harrison in July 2014. She said her sister had given her 'the best gift she could have ever asked for' But the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs. Miss Blake said: 'At first we were devastated - they didn't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew, who would be willing to donate their eggs. 'We went to my parent's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said. 'She promptly replied \"You can use mine\". 'I was in disbelief and giddy with excitement.' After Mrs Wealand's generous offer, they began the long process of tests and counselling. Her eggs were harvested and fertilised with Stephen's sperm. A year later, Miss Blake was implanted with Mrs Wealand's eggs, but sadly, it was unsuccessful. Miss Blake said: 'I was so disappointed when I discovered that Julie's eggs hadn't worked. 'But despite the emotional toll, I knew I had to just carry on.' So later that year in December 2013, they tried for the final time, using Miss Wealand's embryos they'd frozen from the fourth try. Miss Blake, pictured with partner Stephen, 37, and her newborn babies, gave birth by Caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia. Miss Blake and her partner said they were 'overjoyed' when they discovered they were having twins, who, eight months later, are thriving. She will now celebrate Mother's day with her sons. She said: 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood' Miss Blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins. She said: 'I'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests, which were all negative, while trying to conceive from IVF, so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal. 'During a hospital scan, we discovered we were having twins, I was even more overjoyed.' At 35 weeks, doctors worried that Lisa"}

Premier League leaders Chelsea have dropped an average of just 8.6 points per season during the last 10 years. If the Blues replicate the form they have shown in their last 10 games during previous seasons then Manchester City will not be able to retain the league title even if they claim nine consecutive wins. Chelsea look set to win the 2014-15 Premier League title as the Blues tend to finish the season off in fine form. Chelsea dropped two points against Southampton at the weekend but are still odds-on favourites to win the title. Jose Mourinho insists Arsenal have joined Chelsea and Manchester City in the Premier League title race. 2013-14: 11 points dropped. 12-13: 7. 11-12: 15. 10-11: 10. 09-10: 5. 08-09: 6. 07-08: 10. 06-07: 11. 05-06: 6. Average: 8.6 points dropped. Chelsea are seven points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand of both their title rivals. Arsenal are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, having played a game less than the Gunners. However Mourinho said after his side's 1-1 draw with Southampton: \u2018Of course Arsenal are in it. They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea. \u2018Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham? \u2018So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately.' Chelsea would finish the season off with over 85 points (85.4 to be exact) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season. The maximum amount of points Manchester City can ascertain is 85 and that would mean Manuel Pellegrini's side defeating the likes of Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton. Arsenal, on the other hand, will be on 84 points if they win their remaining nine fixtures of the campaign. So it appears Mourinho's statement on Arsenal's title credentials may have just been a ploy to ease the pressure on his players following their draw against Southampton.

{"abstract": "Senator Harry Reid announced his retirement from the Senate, prompting speculation that New York Senator Chuck Schumer will take his place as leader of the Senate Democrats. Schumer has a long history of political success and is well-positioned to take the leadership role, with a large campaign war chest and a network of politically ambitious former staffers. Schumer's 2007 book, \"Positively American,\" outlines his vision for how Democrats should lead America.", "article": "(CNN)Sen. Harry's Reid's perfunctory announcement on Friday that he won't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats -- was followed, hours later, by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with The Washington Post: \"I think Schumer should be able to succeed me.\" That would usher in a whirlwind of activity on Capitol Hill in the next year as New York's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond. Left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block Chuck Schumer's rise. The progressive organization Democracy for America is calling for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post, and the left-leaning Daily Kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing Schumer as too close to the \"Wall Street wing\" of the Democratic Party. With more than a year to go before Senate Democrats will choose a new leader, anything can happen. But after watching Schumer in action for more than 20 years, I'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create. With more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers, Schumer has more money than all but one member of the Senate -- and is the only Democrat in the top 10 in that category. He ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while Democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012, the field looks far more promising for them in 2016: Republicans must defend 24 seats, while Democrats need to protect only 10. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight. Even among the 100-member Senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- Schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime lion of the Senate, once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the Capitol is between Schumer and a television camera. The joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life. Schumer is attuned to television and radio (growing up in the world's media capital will do that). In fact, he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on Sunday, a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the Monday newspapers. But he is also a consummate street politician: At 64, he maintains a habit of biking around New York City neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage, quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade. When a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of New York state, Schumer did her one better, and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in. (He visits every county in the state every year.) Schumer isn't the only politically ambitious kid from Brooklyn -- before attending Harvard, he graduated from a public school, James Madison High, whose alumni include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota (a childhood pal of Schumer's). But Schumer's political climb been a long-term work in progress. He emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a law that banned assault weapons; in the run-up to the final vote, New Yorkers practically couldn't turn on television without seeing Schumer, then a congressman, on the floor of the House, waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban. The higher profile served him well a few years later, when Schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. As a senator on the rise, Schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor. A very partial list of those includes Howard Wolfson, Phil Singer and Blake Zeff, who went on to help run Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign; Ben Lawsky, who is now shaking up the world of finance as New York's top banking regulator; Preet Bharara, who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a U.S. attorney; and Rodney Capel, who is executive director of the state's Democratic Party. With allies, money and the blessing of Reid, Schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book, \"Positively American,\" which lays out a vision for how Democrats should lead America. Like Schumer himself, the book is savvy, hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters. Those who wonder what a Schumer Senate leadership would look like should take a look as Democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the Schumer era on"}

From the edge of the box, he flicked the ball to create some space and curled it into the top corner. A ssecond followed on six minutes when Harry Wilson's flick set Smith clear out wide. He crossed and Lewis Page's ineffective clearance fell straight to McLaughlin to fire home.

{"abstract": "100m hurdler Sally Pearson believes that athletes should be financially compensated for taking part in the Olympics, as entertainers are paid for their performances. The International Olympic Committee currently does not offer any financial remuneration to athletes, who usually fund themselves through sponsorships and grants. Pearson is advocating for a change in the IOC's policy, as she believes that the Olympics would not be possible without the athletes.", "article": "(CNN)Entertainers are paid for entertaining and it's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the Olympics, says 100m hurdler Sally Pearson. In 2014,while the winner of Wimbledon received $2,600,000 and the Augusta Masters champion picked up $1,620,000, when Pearson won gold in the Olympics three years ago she received zero prize money. \"People come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them, we are entertainers\" the Australian, who set an Olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012, told CNN anchor Alex Thomas. \"Entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage, and that's exactly what we're doing in a sporting sense.\" Billions might have tuned in to watch London's 2012 Olympic Games which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory, but the International Olympic Committee's current policy is to (IOC) hand out gold, silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes, but no financial remuneration. \"I can see why they don't, and I'm sure they want to keep it like that, they want to keep it pure,\" added Pearson. \"To be honest we're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not. But the Games wouldn't happen without the athletes.\" It also wouldn't happen without sponsors. The IOC has just signed a new eight-year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant Toyota -- reportedly worth just under $1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals, government support, grants and part-time work. In 2012 only half of American track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $15,000 a year from their sport. The fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history, Pearson told the Australia's Daily Telegraph in 2013 how a year after her Olympic gold medal in London she still wasn't attracting enough sponsors. No stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship. While she has some support from Qantas, AMP and Adidas, appearance fees and prize money in the Diamond League -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28-year-old.

She said: \u2018I didn't expect it to be an early birth at all because my three other pregnancies were all full term. 'I had been quite ill just a couple of weeks before, I had a very bad throat infection around 21 weeks pregnant, which turned into streptococcus A. \u2018Then ten days later I lost my mucus plug and I started wobbling \u2013 just three days later, my waters broke.\u2019 Eloise in Neonatal Intensive Care at Portsmouth Hospital.

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

A conwoman who used her job working at a care home to steal \u00a3116,000 from the families of vulnerable residents used it to pay for a lifestyle she could not afford. Anne Dobson, 39, splashed \u00a320,000 on a wedding ceremony, another \u00a34,000 on the honeymoon, and bought herself a new car worth \u00a316,000. She tricked the families of three residents of\u00a0Broomfield Grange Care Home, Essex, into paying their monthly bill of around \u00a31,200 directly into her bank account. She then passed the money on to her employer Embrace All Care Homes, but not before taking \u00a3400 from each bill for herself. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that she began taking the funds in order to pay down debts she had racked up, but soon went on a spending spree than included a \u00a31,000 holiday. Andrew Jackson, QC, prosecuting, said: 'In 2013 she was marrying again and needed to pay for her wedding and she could not afford the sort of wedding she wanted so continued to defraud the company. 'She paid for her own wedding which she told police had cost about \u00a320,000 and on top of that a honeymoon to the tune of \u00a34,000, all of which were funded by the ongoing fraud. 'By 2013 she was on top of her debts and she freely admitted that it was to pay for the wedding.' The'simple' scheme worked like clockwork each month, the court was told, until one of the residents' families thought to question the amounts being paid. When interviewed by police, Dobson admitted her actions, telling officers she felt 'crap' for what she had done. At one stage the mum from Witham, Essex, even wrote a \u00a37,000 cheque to one resident in a bid to relieve her of her burden of guilt. Mr Jackson added: 'It was a gross breach of the trust that the company placed in her. 'She played a leading role - she was the author of this fraud - there was an abuse of her position of trust and responsibility.' Miss Penny Summers, mitigating, said Dobson was 'absolutely and thoroughly ashamed of herself' and had yet to tell her children of her actions. She said: 'In the beginning, she was in financial difficulties - however she explained to me that there was no excuse for it ongoing. Dobson (right) gave her personal bank details to three families, collected their monthly bills, skimmed \u00a3800 off for herself, then paid the rest to her employer. She then spent some of the money on a \u00a320,000 wedding. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Dobson also paid \u00a34,000 for a honeymoon, \u00a316,000 for a car, and another \u00a31,000 on a holiday. She also used the money to pay off debts. 'The money was used to pay for her wedding and honeymoon.' Dobson, who wore a black jacket and scarf, black skirt and knee-high black boots, sat with her head bowed in the dock listening to the evidence. She sobbed as she was sentenced. Sentencing her to\u00a0two years and four months in jail, Recorder Mark Ockelton, told her: 'You were not in debt at the time - it was committed in order to give you a lifestyle of the sort you thought you ought to have. '\u00a320,000 on a wedding, another \u00a34,000 on a honeymoon, then you bought a new car for \u00a316,000 and spent \u00a31,300 on holiday and that still leaves tens of thousands of pounds unaccounted for.' A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later this year in order to try to recoup some of the missing money. Dobson had joined the Embrace care company as a receptionist before being promoted to the role of administrator - a role which gave her access to residents personal files. Mr Jackson said: 'It became plain that she has been syphoning considerable amounts of money. 'Her role was to update the company head office with regards to what residents or patients would be paying for care - that amounts having been agree with the residents and the care home. 'Once the fee for the care has been agreed, what should happened, by direct debit or standing order, the resident would pay weekly or monthly the required amount direct to the care home.' Dobson admitted a single charge of fraud between July 1, 2012 and July 31, 2014."}

It sounds like Game Of Thrones. But as the camera sweeps across the map, it soon becomes clear that this short film has re-imagined the TV fantasy series to deliver a very modern political message. Titled Game Of Cuts (Winter Is Coming For Councils), it was produced by a campaign group which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England. The production, which cost \u00a311,000, cleverly echoes the drama played out in the hit HBO show. Game Of Thrones spoof Game Of Cuts was produced by campaign group Sigoma, which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England. Made by Sigoma (Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities), it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions cannot fund vital services, while other areas moan about not having luxuries. In the opening scene are characters based on those from the House of Lannister - a rich and powerful dynasty in the south. Among them is a parody of King Joffrey Baratheon, a ruthless ruler, who is informed: 'The seven kingdoms prosper once more. 'We must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north... Our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms.' Honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark) is seen right, in the foreground. He says to the evil King Joffrey of the south (left: 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them' In the film, Queen Cersei is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son Joffrey. Enter honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark): 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them.' 'Our children have no places to read and our roads are crumbling.' But at every turn, Starp's entreaties are scoffed at. To join Sigoma, council must pay an initial fee of \u00a33,000. However, the film has been criticised by Conservative party vice-chairman and former local government minister Bob Neill. He said: 'Taxpayers' money shouldn't be used to subsidise the Box Set fantasies of town hall officials. At the end of the short film, the king fires an arrow at Lord Starp, whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at. According to Sigoma, by March 2016, the amount of funding cuts for regions will be:. 'It's a complete waste of money, but also a complete fiction. It's missing the key plot - there's a black hole in the Kingdom's coffers, thanks to the bad old days of King Gordon. 'His hand of the king, Baron Red Ed, may now eye the throne, but he would wind the clock back to same failed old policies of government waste and higher taxes, meaning less money to go around for local services.' Meanwhile,\u00a0Labour councillor Sir Steve Houghton, chairman of Sigoma said: 'Whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt, the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required. 'Clearly a situation in which some councils are struggling to provide essential services such as care and support for their most vulnerable residents, whilst others have more than enough, is clearly unfair and unsustainable,' he told the Express And Star. He added that the reason the video was made was because national politicians were not listening. According to Sigoma, since 2010, local government in England has lost more than 40 per cent of its core funding. It also said that urban authorities, largely in the North and the Midlands, have lost the most money as a result of these cuts.

The hearing is expected to be completed tomorrow.", "article": "Eleanor de Freitas, 23, died on April 4 last year - three days before she was due to stand trial accused of perverting the course of justice. The family of a young woman who killed herself days before going on trial for 'inventing a rape claim' are calling for lessons to be learned. Eleanor de Freitas, 23, from Fulham, west London, received a private prosecution summons for perverting the course of justice, funded by a man accused of drugging and raping her. But the former Durham University student died on April 4 last year - three days before the trial was due to start at Southwark Crown Court in London. Her family said they were 'astonished' the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to take bipolar sufferer Miss de Freitas to court. She made a rape allegation to Metropolitan Police in January 2013 against wealthy financier, Alexander Economou, 35, claiming the incident had happened just before Christmas 2012. It was investigated but officers closed the case after concluding that gaps in the evidence meant they would not be able to secure a conviction. Despite being told he would not face charges, Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of them together. He then started a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. The whole process is said to have cost him \u00a3200,000. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out, leaving her frightened and devastated. The inquest into her death was originally opened in November last year, but was adjourned so the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders could personally investigate the CPS's decision to prosecute. West London coroner Chinyere Inyama also said he needed to know the remit of the CPS investigation before deciding on the scope of his hearing. Ahead of the resumption tomorrow, her father David de Freitas said: 'The most important thing for us is that lessons are learnt from the tragic death of our daughter. 'We hope that the inquest will explore the important public interest issues regarding prosecutions of rape complainants and the appropriate protections and care that should be put in place for vulnerable people like Eleanor. Her father\u00a0David de Freitas (left) said that lessons need to be learnt from her 'tragic death'. She had accused Alexander Economou (right) of raping her but the allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence. 'In view of the importance of this case and its tragic consequences, we need to make sure that existing guidelines and practices were adhered to and that any shortcomings in these guidelines and practices are identified and remedied so that no other vulnerable young women and their families have to suffer as we and Eleanor did.' Lawyers for the family said they are hoping the inquest will explore the impact the case had on Miss de Freitas taking her own life and the wider public interest of prosecuting rape complainants for perverting the course of justice. Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the family, said: 'This inquest offers an important opportunity to ensure that lessons are learnt from this needless death and so as to ensure that similar tragic outcomes are avoided in the future.' Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry, assembling emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of him and Miss de Freitas (pictured) together. The former Durham University student had bipolar disorder. The inquest into her death will resume tomorrow. Deborah Coles, co-director of support charity Inquest, said: 'This case raises important issues of public importance regarding the treatment of rape complainants. In addition to the specific vulnerabilities of this particular group, Eleanor suffered from a diagnosed serious mental illness. 'There must now be a robust and thorough inquest in order to appropriately consider whether Eleanor received adequate support under the care of West London Mental Health Care Trust and to what extent the prosecution of Eleanor impacted on her life.' The hearing is expected to be completed tomorrow. Eleanor de Freitas claimed she was raped by Alexander Economou just before Christmas 2012. But she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until January 4 last year. Detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution. Officers informed Miss de Freitas on February 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges. But wanting to clear his name, Mr Economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. She received a court summons on August 13 last year. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case, giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it. To the horror of Miss de Freitas and her family, it decided to continue. Miss de Freitas killed herself on April 7, three days before she was due to stand trial."}

The group was charged with misdemeanors under a federal provision against harassing phone calls, and the author was given two years' probation and a $500 fine. Today, the author is still fascinated by computers and works as a network engineer.", "article": "(CNN)I can't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government, but I will never forget the morning in 1983 when two FBI agents showed up on my parents' doorstep. I had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer, which was pretty common for me back then, at age 18. A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business. I had a slight fear this day would come, because only a couple of days earlier, I had a strange call from a friend asking me what I would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team. Two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the FBI. They said they needed to talk to me. Let me start with a little history: I got my first taste of computers in the mid-1970s in junior high school. We had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached. We were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing. I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out. The teacher dialed into the central office computer, logged in and started the math program. I felt like a new world opened for me. For the first time in my life, I saw something that made me imagine what I wanted to do when I grew up. That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school. There, I learned of an Explorer Scout group sponsored by IBM. For the next couple of years I built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others. We would play with computers at school, in Explorer Scouts, in stores like Radio Shack and at home. Finally in 1982, I bought my first computer. Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own. I purchased a Heathkit H-89, which we built in a friend's basement. At the same time I also bought a Hayes 309 baud Smartmodem. I used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems, or BBS, and create more friendships and acquaintances. We were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked. We ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to a major international bank system in Los Angeles to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of only two U.S. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research. We were really just looking around and playing games on these systems; we didn't want to harm anything. This was pretty easy because computers back then were built with a basic set of login information, all of it written in the manuals. We didn't see any harm in it. We would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and, when we got together for Explorers, we'd talk about exploring, not harming systems. At some point, we started calling our group the \"4-1-4s,\" a name we came up with after hanging out at a local park. We noticed etchings on the tables with numbers like 1-9 and 2-7, gang signatures that came from the streets where they operated. Since we all lived in the Milwaukee area, we more or less jokingly gave ourselves the gang name of 414s for the Milwaukee area code. As the months went on, we started to notice issues staying connected with our modems for any length of time. Then, the FBI showed up at my home. Remember, back then home computers were very new, so there were no computer hacking laws. After about a year of back and forth with the FBI, three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls, which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $500 fine each. As I sat before the judge with my lawyer, he asked why he should not give me prison time. I had recently met the love of my life and we were expecting our first child. So I explained that I would like to be around to see the birth of my baby and live a happy and normal family life. The judge agreed to a plea deal with a stipulation that I could not own a modem during the time I remained on probation. Under the deal, we were charged with misdemeanors that carried two years' probation and a $500 fine. Our records would be expunged under the federal youth corrections act. Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers. Oh, and I'm still married to"}

The highly entertaining tongue-in-cheek advertisement opens with a woman making scrambled eggs for breakfast when Kevin Bacon appears in her kitchen, lying suggestively across the counter. The hilarity kicks off as he then spouts a string of mirth-inducing puns. And the memes have started... Come here for your Bacon: The tongue-in-cheek advert last for two minutes and is filled with puns. 'Nobody knows eggs better than Bacon,' he says, smouldering suggestively. He then goes on to wax lyrical on the goodness of eggs as the woman listens wide-eyed and breathless. 'You know I love the smell of bacon in the morning,' he says as he takes the plate of eggs away from her. 'And I like the smell of Bacon,' she states, as she leans in to sniff the Footloose actor, just as her husband walks in. The meta advert \u2013 at one point the actress says 'you sound like a commercial' \u2013 has been wildly praised for its tongue-in-cheek approach to eggs. The American Egg Board said it's the first time the group is using a Hollywood celebrity in a major marketing push. But which bacon are they talking about here? The ad is full of funny moments like this. The online campaign is supported by print advertisements which also reference the star's last name. The campaign comes at an opportune moment; eggs which were long shunned and viewed as high-cholesterol are now back in vogue in the fickle world of food fashion due to their high protein content. Bob Krouse, CEO of Midwest Poultry Services, an egg producer in Mentone, Indiana, said  that he's glad the egg board is taking a slightly edgier approach in its marketing. Mr Krouse said: 'I always felt like egg farmers were too conservative.' The 'Wake Up To Eggs With Bacon' push by the ad agency Grey is an update on the 'Wake Up To Eggs' campaign that launched in 2012. 'With a last name like Bacon, I'm the obvious choice, and I'm excited to be a part of the new Incredible Edible Egg campaign,' the actor said. 'I like the creativity behind the idea, and I've always been a big fan of eggs.' The egg and Bacon pairing has been received with delight byTwittersphere. The Project TV made a joke of its own: 'There is now officially only one degree of separation between Kevin Bacon and eggs.' User @diannenice said: 'Is there nothing @KevinBacon can't do? Radio station K-Rock tweeted: 'Can anyone tell us why this took until 2015 to happen?'"}

The millionaire real-estate heir and murder defendant was arrested on Saturday at the JW Marriott hotel, where cops found the gun and marijuana stashed in his room. John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst approached him just before midnight on Friday. Robert Durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around New Orleans' French Quarter with his loaded.38-caliber revolver in his pocket, claims a nightclub doorman. 'I asked him to come into the club, but he said in a female-ish soft voice, \"I would like to come in, but I can't right now,\"'\u00a0Phillips told the New York Post. Durst, 71, then\u00a0pulled open his brown-tweed suit jacket to reveal the butt of the gun in a belt holster, Phillips said. 'I thought to myself, I hope this old guy with a gun doesn't do anything stupid.' Phillips said that 'the whole exchange took less than a minute' outside the club and Durst 'just stumbled a little as he walked down the block.' 'I just thought he was an old man who was a little bit off. I kept thinking this old guy is on too much prescription medication.' Durst, 71, was arrested on the eve of Sunday's final episode of 'The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst,' and he agreed on Monday to face trial for the murder of Susan Berman, who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished. The final episode ended with the whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom. 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of water running can be heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' John Phillips, 32, a doorman at the Mahogany Jazz Hall Burlesque and Absinthe House said Durst revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon. The whispered words of Durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge. Now those words could come back to haunt him \u2014 or help him \u2014 as he faces his murder charge. A possible move by prosecutors to introduce the incriminating material from a six-part documentary on his strange life and connection to three killings could backfire as interview footage did in the Michael Jackson molestation trial and the Robert Blake murder case. In both cases, the defense was allowed under the 'doctrine of completeness' to provide segments of interviews that presented their clients favorably without subjecting them to tough cross-examination. 'I submit that Blake didn't have to testify and Michael Jackson didn't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews,' said attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., who represented both men. 'They just got greedy. They were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them.' In the Jackson case, the defense used unaired footage to counter damage done by Living With Michael Jackson, a damning documentary in which Jackson held hands with his accuser and spoke of letting children into his bed. 'I'd slit my wrists before I'd hurt a child,' Jackson said in one outtake shown by the defense, according to Mesereau, who won the performer's acquittal 10 years ago. Michael Jackson's lead defense attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr. said the so-called incriminating material from the Durst documentary could backfire as interview footage did in the Jackson molestation trial in 2005. In the Durst case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay.

He also told radio host John Gambling during an interview on AM 970 THE ANSWER that Obama is ignoring 'enormous amounts of crime' being committed by blacks. Roughly '70 percent' of homicides in New York City are committed by African Americans, Giuliani said. 'There are many, many extremely understandable' reasons for that both historically and environmentally, he added. 'And if an African-American president stood up and said - I hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that Bill Cosby used to say. The kinds of stuff that Imam Pasha says at the Malcolm X Mosque: This is our responsibility,' he said, trailing off into an explanation of Pasha's doctrine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, waves to public during a conference in Berlin, Germany last Saturday. Fresh off his trip abroad, Giuliani contended on Thursday that internationally, America is considered a 'racist state' Imam Izak-EL Mu'eed Pasha is a black, Muslim leader in New York who Giuliani has been friends with more than a decade. I remember Pasha saying to his congregation, if there were less crime in the community, there would be less police in our community, Giuliani recalled. When referencing Cosby, the retired New York politician was referring to allegations that surfaced last year that black actor raped or otherwise sexually assaulted number of former cast-mates and other women throughout the '60s, 70s and 80s. Prior to that 'America's Dad' had earned a reputation for forcefully encouraging African-American teens to clean up their act and make better use of the educational system their ancestors fought to earn access to. In on memorable - and controversial - address Cosby touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism. Now known as 'the Pound Cake speech', Cosby said, 'These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake. 'Then we all run out and are outraged: \"The cops shouldn\u2019t have shot him.\" What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?' Cosby asked. 'I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said, \"If you get caught with it, you\u2019re going to embarrass your mother.\u201d''America's mayor' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late, saying late last month he's not sure, based on the president's upbringing and behavior, that Obama 'loves America.' After several days of spinning, and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation's first black president, Giuliani finally ended the media-frenzy by penning an op-ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the president would speak more highly of American exceptionalism. Striving to avoid another kerfuffle, Giuliani was careful to balance out his criticisms of Obama on AM 970 with a note of goodwill to the president. 'I disagree with Barack Obama on almost everything, but I think Barack Obama's a good family man, and he's a good man.' 'This is the model we need,' he said of the positive example Obama is setting for the African American communities as a father and a husband. Earlier in the interview, Giuliani suggested the savage beating of a 15-year-old girl in a Brooklyn McDonald's on Monday, the shooting of two Ferguson police officers this morning and an incident at a city council meeting involving NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, at which 20 protester heckled him until they were led out by the cops, all occurred because Obama hadn't done more to verbally build up America's police. 'It all starts at the top. It\u2019s the tone that\u2019s set by the President,' Giuliani said on radio station AM 970 THE ANSWER. President Barack Obama, pictured here boarding Air Force One today, should seek to emulate Bill Cosby when it comes to talking about crimes committed by blacks, Giuliani contended, prefacing the statement with his loathe to mention Cosby 'because of what happened afterwards' Giuliani, who just returned stateside following a conference in Germany on 'Tolerance and Equality against Fundamentalism and Misogyny and says he spent a large portion of the fall traveling abroad, contended that internationally, America's police are considered to be 'racist.' 'It is the obligation of the President to explain,' to Americans and the global community 'that our police are the best in the world,' he said.

{"abstract": "New research suggests that early humans may have started out as scavengers rather than hunters, obtaining enough meat to sustain themselves from the scraps left behind by predators. Dr Briana Pobiner studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by scavenging. Her findings suggest that early humans could have obtained enough calories from scavenging to provide an entire day's worth of energy, potentially explaining the shift in their diet to consume meat.", "article": "Early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet. However, new research by paleontologists has suggested that our human ancestors may have started out as scavengers rather than the efficient killing machines they are often portrayed as. The findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet. Scroll down for video. Homo erectus, pictured in the reconstruction above, needed around 2200 calories a day to survive and could have easily obtained this by scavenging meat left on the carcasses by predatory big cats in Africa at the time. Dr Briana Pobiner, a palaeoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by picking the bones left behind by predators. She estimates that early humans like Homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators. She told Mail Online: 'Early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants, and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands. 'Probably anything that wasn\u2019t too rotten was fair game.' Lions, like the two eating a zebra kill above, leave large amounts of their kills untouched, meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators. She added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging. She said: 'I think it was both \u2013 probably a combination of scavenging from larger animals and hunting smaller animals. 'One major energetic advantage of scavenging is that you have a really high success rate in the sense that unless a carcass is absolutely picked clean, like what happens after vultures have gotten to it, you\u2019re virtually guaranteed to get some meat and marrow from what\u2019s left. 'With hunting, you can expend a lot of energy and come up empty-handed.' Dr Pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills (as shown above) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be  picked clean by early humans. Speaking in a video on the Smithsonian website, she added:\u00a0'I've found in some of the fossils I studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals. 'Sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps. It has really big implications for a lot of other major changes that happened in human evolutionary history. 'The evolution in meat eating has been linked to an increase in brain size, its been linked to an increase in home range size and maybe the expansion out of Africa. 'Competing with big carnivores you needed sophisticated interaction, communication and other social skills that are another hallmark of being human.' In research published in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern African savanna in Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy. She looked at how much meat was consumed by lions and leopards before measuring what was left for scavengers. She also watched how much meat other large meat eaters like hyenas and jackals left behind once they were finished with a carcass. Dr Briana Pobiner (above) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first. Speaking to Popular Archaeology she said: 'The site is a great analogue for the kinds of African savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived. 'This may have been very much like past carnivore communities during the time our ancestors were starting to eat meat from larger animals, when we have evidence that felids \u2014 ancient lions, leopards, and three species of sabertoothed cats \u2014 lived alongside our ancestors and may have been the dominant kinds of carnivores at this time.' Dr Pobiner found that in modern Africa even a 'defleshed' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it. She estimates that an entire wildebeest or zebra carcass could yield 5kg and 15 kg of meat respectively even after a predator had eaten. This means a wildebeest carcass could provide 2200 calories and a zebra carcass could provide 6080 calories - enough for a small family of Homo erectus. Dr Pobiner said: 'This is enough for the entire daily caloric requirements of at least one Homo erectus/ergaster male, estimated to require approximately 2090-2290 calories per day"}

The headline in the New York Times was tantalisingly mysterious: \u2018City of the Monkey God is believed located: Expedition reports success in Honduras exploration\u2019. If readers were a little puzzled as to the huge significance of this announcement, they were soon put right by the man who had made it. The date was July 12, 1940, and American explorer Theodore Morde had just emerged from the darkest jungles of Central America with an incredible story about what he\u2019d found there. Morde, a real-life Indiana Jones who later became a wartime U.S. spy, had been recruited by the founder of New York\u2019s prestigious Museum of the American Indian to try to find a mythical lost \u2018White City\u2019 dripping in gold that had been founded by a mysterious civilisation as great as the Aztecs and the Mayans. Adventurers had been searching for La Ciudad Blanca for centuries, ever since Spanish conquistador and explorer Hernando Cortes conquered Central America in the early 16th century and heard rumours of its riches. But it remained hidden for hundreds of years until Morde insisted he had found it deep in the rain forests of Mosquitia, more than 32,000 square miles of hellishly inhospitable wilderness in Honduras and Nicaragua. He described how, armed only with a revolver and a machete, he and a companion named Lawrence Brown had spent four months hacking their way through \u2018almost inaccessible\u2019 jungle, swamps, rivers and mountains before coming upon a hidden valley that contained the remains of a white-stoned, walled city. There, the local Indians told him, a long-vanished people, who were contemporaries of the Ancient Mayans, had once worshipped a strange Monkey God whose giant statue was still buried under centuries of vegetation. They made bloody human sacrifices to their simian deity, then ate the victims in an act of ritualised cannibalism. Morde said that on his own brief visit he had himself seen a disturbing rite in which local natives ritually slaughtered and ate monkeys in a twisted hangover from the cult. To back his astonishing claims, Morde \u2014 who was only 29 but had already sailed around the world five times \u2014 brought back several thousand artefacts to America such as stone utensils and tiny carved monkey masks. A team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists have announced that they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the City of the Monkey God, in a crater-shaped rainforest valley. He never revealed the precise location of the ruined city for fear it would be looted before he could go back. However, he never returned and died mysteriously in 1954, taking the secret of its location with him. It remained a compelling mystery, seemingly lifted from the pages of H. Rider Haggard. Generations of adventurers plunged into the jungle to search for the city, and experts dismissed Morde\u2019s discovery as a self-promoting fantasy. Explorers who reported glimpsing the tops of white buildings peeking through the forest canopy were told they were just limestone cliffs. But now the sceptics may have to eat their words. A team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists have just returned from La Mosquitia. They have announced that \u2014 like Morde \u2014 they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the City of the Monkey God, in a crater-shaped rainforest valley encircled by steep mountains. According to the National Geographic magazine, which accompanied the expedition, the archaeologists have surveyed and mapped \u2018extensive plazas, earthworks, mounds and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived 1,000 years ago, and then vanished\u2019. The team also discovered a breathtaking collection of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned. Christopher Fisher, an archaeologist from Colorado State University and team member, believes the sculptures \u2014 found at the base of the pyramid \u2014 may have been offerings to the Monkey God. The team first found the ruins nearly three years ago during an aerial survey using a high-tech scanner that was able to pierce the jungle canopy with laser light and reveal archaeological features. The city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured hiding Rama and Sita, two Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. But the Honduran monkey God is more menacing. It showed ruins that stretched for more than a mile along a river through the valley. The remote, rugged area is a major cocaine smuggling route and the scientists, who were ferried to the site by helicopter, were accompanied by Honduran special forces and former members of Britain\u2019s SAS. Wild animals routinely wandered through their camp, clearly never having encountered humans before. Even without excavation, the scientists found 52 artefacts sticking out from the ground with many more clearly lying in the earth and vegetation beneath. They included stone ceremonial seats,"}

The Swirl tap sends water from the tap in a symmetrical design that apparently saves 15 per cent more water. Simin Qiu, a student at the London Royal College of Art, said he hoped the design might become popular in hotels and homes. He said: 'It's a very simple design. I've used two turbines to create the effect, with one making the water flow clockwise and the other anticlockwise. 'The spiral is an organic shape water takes in nature and I wanted to recreate that. 'It is more comfortable on people's hands because it's not flowing in a solid line. My design changes the angle the water hits your hands at and it's smoother.' Mr Qiu is curerntly testing a prototype of his tap, which took him two months to design. It uses turbines that spin in opposite directions inside the valve at the mouth of the tap to send thin streams of water spiralling down into the sink. The Swirl tap uses two turbines inside the faucet (left) to send the water into a spiral. The graphic on the right shows how the turbines fit together with push value to provide a spinning vortex of water onto the users hands. The tap works by pressing a single button on top, allowing water at a preset temperature to flow out of the tap. The tap is operated by touching a switch on the top. Mr Qiu says the desing allows water to come out at the same pressure as a standard faucet but uses less water. However, the temperature from the tap has to be preset so that the water coming out will always be the right temperature. Mr Qui added: 'I hope it will be ready by the end of the year. 'It will be more expensive than ordinary taps, it's not something that will be in every home. 'It's a luxury product that will probably be in hotels and limited use in homes by next year.'

'It doesn't matter where you are, stop making excuses and change will happen. \u202a#\u200enomoreexcuses\u202c.' Ms Kang, who quickly worked off her baby weight after all three of her pregnancies, has been married to former marine David Casler since 2010. Their boys are now aged six, four and three. The busy mom is also the owner of elderly residential care homes and the founder of her nonprofit Fitness without Borders, which funds her No Excuse Mom Group. Dedicated dad: Danny Foster showed off his tattoos and his adorable sons in this adorable family photo. Strike a pose: Hazel Blandon had her children flaunt their muscles for her inspiring picture. And now she is sharing her 'long-term and sustainable' diet and fitness plan with her new book, which she called a 'labor of love'. But\u00a0Ms Kang had her own body struggles throughout her twenties. 'I was bulimic,' she told Cosmopolitan. 'I was addicted to the endorphins in my body every single time I vomited. It went on from about age 23 until I was 27.' She eventually overcame her eating disorder and began to live a healthier lifestyle. During her first pregnancy, she started to love and value her body more than ever. Life changing: Ms Kang rose to fame in 2013 after she shared this controversial picture. Many people accused her of 'fat-shaming' other mothers. Big goals: She is now the author of her own No More Excuses Diet book, which hits shelves next week. Before and After: Ms Kang, who has three songs ages six, four and three, said it took her about eight months to lose the weight after each of her pregnancies. And while she lost the baby weight after each of her pregnancies, she doesn't expect new mothers to be back in their skinny jeans in"}

She has achieved great success, with her company making pre-tax profits of \u00a36.5 million last year and her wealth estimated at \u00a3295 million. Rucker's white revolution began when she was faced with her boyfriend's dreary furnishings in 1993, and has since spread across the Atlantic.", "article": "Her boyfriend\u2019s dreary taste in furnishings is said to be the spark that first set Chrissie Rucker off in pursuit of all things white. Faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery in his flat in Fulham, West London, she rushed to the shops to find replacements in more neutral tones, but struggled when it came to buying good quality bed linen in the purest of whites. She didn\u2019t know it at the time, of course, but that day in 1993 marked the moment Rucker began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white. Scroll down for video. Chrissie Rucker is the founder and director of The White Company and is pictured here with a selection of her products. More than two decades on, the 46-year-old founder of The White Company is one of the UK\u2019s wealthiest businesswomen having transformed what began as a 12-page mail-order catalogue selling white towels and bed linen into a home furnishings and fashion empire. Her business sells everything from \u00a320 scented candles to \u00a3200 cashmere jumpers, and while she has branched out to shades such as \u2018biscuit marl\u2019 and \u2018cloud grey\u2019, Rucker remains obsessed with all things pale. Her white revolution has seen sales soaring at her 53 High Street stores \u2014 even the Queen has sent out her ladies-in-waiting to buy bedspreads \u2014 and has spread across the Atlantic where she launched a U.S. website last year. Latest figures show that the mother-of-four\u2019s company made pre-tax profits of \u00a36.5 million last year \u2014 an increase of 38 per cent. Her position on the Sunday Times Rich list has climbed steeply from 427th to 326th. She and her husband\u2019s combined wealth is estimated at \u00a3295 million. Aside from the money pouring into company coffers, Rucker owns three stunning properties, all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors. There\u2019s a \u00a312.5 million 17th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire, set in 51 acres of parkland, a \u00a34 million townhouse in London\u2019s fashionable Holland Park and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the Swiss Alps, Haus Alpina, a luxury chalet with full-time staff which Rucker rents out for a staggering \u00a326,000 a week. Chrissie, pictured at her Buckinghamshire home, realised she had found a gap in the market when she was looking to decorate her future husband's house all in white. Even at Rucker\u2019s main residence, the country mansion, the only flashes of colour you\u2019ll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse-mad daughters. All in all, it\u2019s a rather surprising state of affairs for a woman who disappointed her parents by leaving school at 16 with six O-levels and signing up at the Lucie Clayton finishing school which promised to prepare girls for marriage, society and \u2018the season\u2019. However, it was not long before Rucker decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the London social circuit. Indeed, the statuesque blonde\u2019s path to fortune is rather more colourful than her dazzling white shops might suggest. Belinda Christian Rucker, as she was named by her parents, was born in 1968 into an illustrious military family \u2014 her maternal grandfather, Sir Harold Pyman, was Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in Europe and a recipient of the Knight Grand Cross and Distinguished Service Order. The daughter of commodity broker, Patrick Rucker, Chrissie, as she was known, grew up in Kent and attended \u00a35,275-a-term Combe Bank School in Kent. Her parents divorced, and aged seven, she and her younger sister, Jo, went with their mother Rosemary, a horse breeder, to live with their new step-father, estate agent Jeremy Calcutt. Those days, she recalled, were happy but chaotic. \u2018My mother was really only interested in her horses,\u2019 she said, \u2018so the stables were immaculate, the house a tip.\u2019 Chrissie's husband, Nick Wheeler (pictured),\u00a0set up his shirt company, Charles Tyrwhitt, in 1986 while a geography student at Bristol University. It was all a far cry from the vision Rucker would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light. Her early ambitions lay in fashion. While at Lucy Clayton she studied dressmaking and design. But as a teenager in London in the late Eighties, Rucker seemed intent on immersing herself in a \u2018Sloane Ranger\u2019 lifestyle.

{"abstract": "Scottish researchers have found that cholesterol-lowering statins can reduce hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent. The study reviewed 17 statin trials involving over 100,000 patients and found that the medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks. A new type of cholesterol-lowering drug may also halve the risk of a heart attack or stroke, according to new research.", "article": "Statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, researchers claim. A breakthrough study found that the cholesterol-lowering drugs improved outcomes for those suffering from the common cardiac disorder. The medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks. Prevention?\u00a0Cholesterol-lowering statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, Scottish researchers found. But the latest research is the first to show the benefits for those at risk of heart failure \u2013 which occurs when the organ struggles to maintain adequate blood flow to the body. Scientists from the University of Glasgow said their findings herald a \u2018significant benefit\u2019 for the near-one million Britons affected by the condition. Exerts from the university\u2019s Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences reviewed 17 statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients as part of their analysis. Lead researcher Dr David Preiss said: \u2018Heart failure is disabling, expensive to treat, especially in more advanced stages, and patients have a poor outcome. \u2018While it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks, to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before. \u2018The results of this analysis clearly show a modest, but significant benefit, reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent, which is clinically important.\u2019 Heart failure happens when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Around 100,000 Britons a year are thought to die from it. Damage: Heart failure (pictured) affects nearly a million Birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body. Figures show 15 per cent of patients with the condition die in hospital \u2013 twice the European average \u2013 partly because of late diagnosis and treatment that fails to adequately control symptoms. Signs including swollen legs, tiredness and shortness of breath \u2013 which usually worsen following exercise. Dr Preiss added: \u2018It is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia [lack of blood flow] that occurs before a heart attack, leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart. \u2018Further study of the potential mechanism is needed.\u2019 The study found a 10 per cent reduction in first hospital admissions for heart failure, although researchers believe the impact of statins has been underestimated. The study was reported at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress in Glasgow and was published online in The European Heart Journal. Between eight and ten million adults take statins \u2013 which are now the most widely prescribed drugs in the UK. The NHS estimates they save 7,000 lives a year in the UK, despite growing concern over the extent of side effects such as increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Doctors once prescribed the drug to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade, but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Under current guidance, the threshold is even lower. Those who have a 10 per cent or greater risk are being offered statins, including patients aged 80 and over. Cholesterol-lowering drugs can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, researchers\u00a0claim. A new study shows for the first time that statins improve the outcome for those suffering from a common heart disorder. Researchers from the University of Glasgow carried out a review of 17 statin trials including over 100,000 patients. The new drugs block\u00a0bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs. A new type of cholesterol-lowering drug may halve the risk of a heart attack or stroke, new research suggests. People taking the experimental drug for high cholesterol were half as likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke as those taking conventional statins. The results could offer an alternative to the estimated one in three Westerners with high cholesterol who have been unable to manage their condition with diet, exercise and statin drugs currently on the market. The results are'really impressive and very encouraging' for the new drugs, said one independent expert, Dr Judith Hochman of NYU Langone Medical Center. The U.S. government will decide this summer whether to allow two of these drugs on the market. The drugs are evolocumab, which Amgen wants to call Repatha, and alirocumab, which Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi have named Praluent. They lower LDL or bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs, by blocking PCSK9, a substance that interferes with the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. Side effects remain a question, though, especially on thinking, confusion and memory - problems the FDA has already voiced concern about and asked the companies to track. Although the drugs are linked to a reduction in heart attacks, this did not explain the benefits in heart failure. Lead researcher Dr David Preiss, at the university\u2019"}
{"abstract": "The article tells the story of a woman whose husband is desperately ill in hospital and the difference between two consultants she encounters. The first is hostile and dismissive, while the second is kind and compassionate. The second consultant becomes a rock for the couple as they face a roller-coaster of medical issues, including a kidney tumour, sepsis, and an aortic aneurysm.", "article": "Here's the scene: My husband Tony is desperately ill and I'm sitting by his hospital bed. He's been sick for weeks and at one stage I was told he was expected to die. He's now out of a coma and no longer, thank God, one of the ten sickest people in the vast teaching hospital. But still no one knows what's wrong with him. He's been moved from the intensive care unit into a small room when suddenly a consultant descends. Sarah Foot says that while with her sick husband Tony in hospital a consultant with hostile body language\u00a0came crashing in and started talking down to them as she gave the diagnosis. She crashes through the door, followed by half a dozen of her juniors, who crowd round the bed and wait for her to speak. No one's in any doubt who's in charge. She talks not at us, but down to us, like some reincarnation of the monstrous Sir Lancelot Spratt (played by James Robertson Justice) from the Doctor In The House films. Except this isn't funny. Tony has been in hospital for more than a month, but how or why he got ill so suddenly no one really knows. One minute I was wondering whether he just had man flu; the next he was delirious with fever and dreadful abdominal pains, and being rushed to hospital in an ambulance. Just 48 hours later, he was in a drug-induced coma with sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by an infection, his organs shutting down one by one. When he was admitted, his symptoms suggested pancreatitis - where the pancreas becomes inflamed. I want to know if the doctors are any the wiser about what caused his body to go into free fall. Sarah accompanied Tony as he was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, and shortly after was in a drug-induced coma with sepsis. So, looking up at the sea of faces, I ask: 'Was it pancreatitis that started this?' I remain sitting, because if I stand, Tony - who is unable to speak for himself as he has a tube in his windpipe - will feel even more helpless. 'Yes,' the consultant declares haughtily, 'he presented with similar symptoms.' 'But was it actually pancreatitis?' She repeats herself impatiently: 'Yes, he presented with similar symptoms.' Her hostile body language is telling me to shut up and know my place. I try again, but still she answers like a politician, repeating the same refrain. Then she shuffles her notes and says that another consultant is coming to discuss a kidney tumour that showed up on a scan. This news floors me. 'No one mentioned a tumour.' 'Yes, they did.' 'No, they didn't.' 'Yes, they did.' For a moment we are in panto territory with someone whose life is hanging by a thread lying terrified between us. Then off she breezes. I'm torn between bursting into tears and storming into the corridor to tell those junior doctors that if they learn one thing today, it's how not to talk to the sick and their loved ones. Patient's relative meets doctors: it's a scene repeated daily in hospitals all over the country. You can guarantee the next of kin are frightened and exhausted. Life and death are routine for medical staff, but for the rest of us they are, well, life and death. Doctors will argue they are appallingly busy, would love to give people more attention, but don't have the time. Or that to do their job properly they need the emotional distance. I can understand that. But here's another story from the same hospital. Same patient, different consultant, working under exactly the same pressure and constraints as the others. And his approach was so full of kindness and compassion that I wonder whether the disparity between those who have a good bedside manner and those who don't is about individuals rather than the pressure of the job. This man became our rock when Tony's illness - whatever caused the sepsis in the first place was never identified - sparked off a chain reaction that had doctors chasing problems around his body for a year after he was admitted in March 2006. One serious ailment would be contained, only for another to present. There was massive internal damage from the sepsis to be repaired surgically, but also an aortic aneurysm (a swelling of the main blood vessel leading from the heart) to be bypassed and more infections to be cured. Not to mention that cancerous kidney tumour to be dealt with when he was well enough. 'Roller-coaster' doesn't come near the ride he was on. Much of his care fell to this one particular specialist, a urologist, who, to my astonishment, gave me his mobile phone number and told me to call if I had concerns. One Sunday night, eight months into this medical odyssey, Tony was nauseous, with his temperature rising and his remaining strength draining fast. So I rang this doctor at"}

The couple have openly stated how they wish to have a large family although any plans will have to be been put on hold for now.

{"abstract": "Arsene Wenger has been the manager of Arsenal for almost 19 years, surviving 156 Premier League bosses in the process. During this time, there have been 156 managerial changes at other clubs in the division. Most of these changes have been due to managers being sacked, with only 18 leaving by choice to go straight into another job.", "article": "Since September 1996, Arsene Wenger has ruled the roost at Arsenal, not just building a squad and controlling a team, but shaping a club. In almost 19 years in charge of the Gunners, Wenger has won three Premier League titles, lifted five FA Cups, led his team to their only ever European final and masterminded the move to the Emirates. When he does eventually decide to step down, Wenger\u2019s legacy will not just be about his successes, but also his longevity. Arsene Wenger has been at Arsenal for almost 19 years, while every other team has changed manager. Wenger led the Gunners to their first Champions League final, and has won three Premier League titles. The Arsenal boss has been in north London since September 1996, surviving 156 Premier League bosses. In an era where Premier League chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as Jose Mourinho tends to be towards referees, Wenger is approaching two decades in the job \u2013 almost 15 years longer than the next longest-serving manager in the division. In fact, since the Frenchman arrived in north London, there have been 156 changes in management at the other clubs in the division. Here Sporstmail looks at the men Wenger has survived\u2026. What counts as a change? With caretaker managers, interim appointments, and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time, it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers. Counting caretaker managers would mean, technically, that David Pleat had been appointed Tottenham manager three times in five years. There were times when it seemed David Pleat just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at Spurs again. Ruud Gullit had already left two Premier League clubs before Wenger had been in the job three years. Gordon Strachan (left) replacing Ron Atkinson was the second change after Wenger arrived. So while \u2018interim\u2019 managers are included in our total, caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term. Added to that, for those few occasions when two men have been in charge at the same time, they are counted as only one sacking unless, as with the case of Roy Evans when he worked alongside Gerard Houlier at Liverpool, one is sacked before the other. Landmarks. That all means that Gus Poyet\u2019s sacking this month is the 156th managerial change since Wenger took over. Ray Harford\u2019s resignation at Blackburn, less than a month after \u2018the Professor\u2019 got his feet under the desk at Arsenal, was the first, with five more coming in the 1996-97 season. Ray Harford (left) was the first manager to go after Wenger was appointed, while Gus Poyet is the most recent. Peter Reid\u2019s dismissal from Leeds United in November 2003 marked the 50th reign Wenger had survived, while Steve Bruce\u2019s decision to leave Wigan for Sunderland brought up the century in the summer of 2009. Tony Pulis\u2019 shock resignation from Crystal Palace on the eve of this season was the 150th time a manager had left their job in the Wenger era. Peter Reid, sacked by Leeds in 2003, marked the 50th Premier League manager to go in the Wenger era. When Steve Bruce left Wigan for Sunderland it marked the 100th managerial change since Wenger arrived. Unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years. The first half of Wenger\u2019s tenure at Arsenal produced just 63 sackings in a little over nine years. In the same time since then, there have been 93 changes, at a rate of around 10 a season. Last season\u2019s total of 14 managerial changes was, in fact, the largest number in Premier League history. In contrast the 2002-03 season saw the fewest changes since Wenger\u2019s arrival, with only five managers leaving their posts. Tony Pulis' resignation from Crystal Palace last summer was change No 150 since Wenger started. Method of change? The vast majority of the time, when a Premier League manager leaves his job, it\u2019s because he\u2019s been told to clear out his desk. A lucky few get to set their own date, as Wenger surely will in the coming years, but most are pushed before they can jump. Remarkably, in the last 18-and-a-bit years since Wenger joined Arsenal, only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job (and three of those went to international management rather than another club), while some resigned and a handful retired. Roy Hodgson is one of only two Premier League managers in the past two decades to leave for England. Steve McClaren also left a Premier League club to take the biggest job in English football. Three times a manager stepped down for health reasons, although two of those were Joe Kinnear, while one manager, Dave Jones, was placed on gardening leave in January 2000. Ron Atkinson (Coventry) and Steve Coppell (Crystal Palace) share the honour of being the two"}

When Claire Crisp agreed to have her three-year-old daughter Mathilda vaccinated against swine flu, she believed she was doing the best to protect her from a life-threatening pandemic. In 2009, all children under five were invited to be vaccinated in a nationwide scheme. Fortunately, the much-feared 2009-2010 outbreak never reached the pandemic scale expected. But Claire is\u00a0convinced that the vaccine against it has left Mathilda with severe narcolepsy. Mathilda is the youngest known person in the world to be diagnosed with the neurological condition, which causes sufferers to suddenly fall asleep during the day. Mathilda also had terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain.Now she is part of a protracted legal battle against the Government for compensation for vaccine-related narcolepsy. Last week, their case went to court on appeal. This wrangling has continued despite the fact the Government\u2019s scientists admitted two years ago that the vaccine, Pandemrix, could cause narcolepsy, having previously denied any link. In a statistical investigation, published in the British Medical Journal, they found children given the vaccine were 14 times more likely to have developed narcolepsy than unvaccinated children. Claire, 44, a former NHS physiotherapist, thought she was playing safe when she had Mathilda vaccinated. Doctors had suggested her daughter could be at particular risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition, laryngomalacia, which obstructs breathing. Children normally grow out of it by three. \u2018We took the swine flu risk seriously since Mathilda had only recently outgrown laryngomalacia,\u2019 says Claire, who also has a son, Elliot, and another daughter, Liberty. NHS clinics administered more than 900,000 doses of Pandemrix in 2009 and 2010. Mathilda\u2019s first troubling symptoms developed within two weeks. Her sleep became disturbed, leaving her exhausted in the day. Then she began to suffer from hallucinations at night, thinking there were demons in her bedroom. \u2018The symptoms just got worse \u2014 she wasn\u2019t sleeping at night, and sleeping and crying all day,\u2019 says Claire. \u2018Nearly every time I turned round in the day, she was asleep. \u2018She was slurring her words. She could not walk in a straight line, she suffered excruciating leg pains. She also became incontinent.\u2019 Then she developed cataplexy, where she\u2019d become temporarily paralysed for seconds by emotional triggers such as happiness or surprise, though staying conscious. \u2018Her brother would say a joke and she would fall down,\u2019 says Claire. Within six months, Claire and her husband Oliver, a professor of theology, were housebound caring for Mathilda. She was taken to a children\u2019s hospital for what Claire calls \u2018a series of failed visits\u2019. Initially, doctors thought she had a brain tumour, but after tests they ruled that out. \u2018The doctors quickly wrote us off as an anxious mother and a pain-in-the-a*** child.\u2019 The family was being referred to a psychiatric unit when a locum doctor from India diagnosed narcolepsy, which normally appears at around the age of 15. Doctors had suggested to Claire her daughter could be at risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition. Claire spoke to a friend\u2019s cousin, who has narcolepsy. \u2018They warned me that we probably wouldn\u2019t get any help for it in Europe, but said Stanford University in California had the world\u2019s best expertise. I got in touch with them.\u2019 Based on blood samples sent by post, experts at the university confirmed the diagnosis. The acknowledged world expert in the condition, Dr Emmanuel Mignot, is the director of the university\u2019s Centre for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. He is recognised for finding the cause of narcolepsy \u2014 the failure of special \u2018wakefulness\u2019 cells, called hypocretins, found in the brain\u2019s sleep centre. Dr Mignot has also identified a possible reason why the vaccine has caused narcolepsy: a part of the swine flu virus is similar to a part of the hypocretin cell. The Pandemrix vaccine primes the immune system\u2019s \u2018killer\u2019 cells to attack this part of the swine flu virus. But in a minority of patients, the killer cells also mistakenly attack the hypocretin cells, thinking they are swine flu cells. The risk is confined to people with a susceptible genetic make-up, Dr Mignot wrote in the journal Science Translational Medicine in 2013 \u2014 with around 20 per cent of the European population having this gene profile.

In October, Fabian Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed. He was booked less than nine minutes into his first England start as he launched a series of tackles. For a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution. Fabian Delph of England speaks to the media during the England press conference ahead of the clash with Italy. Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed bite to Roy Hodgson\u2019s midfield. Delph \u00a0cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years. The Aston Villa midfielder soon settled, however, and it turned out to be neither. He produced a terrific display in Basle and won his fourth cap against Lithuania on Friday. He has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and, after collecting 20 in two years, has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be more careful,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I like to tackle and I\u2019ve managed to curb it this season. I got the yellow against Switzerland and then the red against Sunderland but other than that I\u2019ve been pretty clean. I\u2019m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage! \u2018It\u2019s hard to lunge into tackles in international football. If you lunge in on a top-class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down. I tried to set a target. I\u2019ve been able to do that so I\u2019m quite proud.\u2019 Harry Kane made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at Wembley Stadium. Both Kane and Delph shone for England as Roy Hodgson's side swept Lithuania aside at Wembley. Even so, his natural aggression lifted England in Switzerland, where a 2-0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the World Cup. \u2018I remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong, but it didn\u2019t faze me,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018It was one of those things. I tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it. After that it was just about trying to stay on my feet, trying to get through the game, trying to perform well, with good energy, keep the ball moving and I managed to do that.\u2019 Dennis Wise can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage Delph during one of the regular games between the Leeds staff and youth team. Wise, manager at Elland Road at the time, liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18. Lithuania's Tomas Mikuckis tracks Aston Villa and England midfielder Delph during the game at Wembley. \u2018Those games did get quite tasty,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I did tackle him and he tackled me back. They tended to get quite heated. He gave me my debut. I\u2019m so grateful to Dennis. And Gus Poyet, his assistant. Gus could kick a few people as well.\u2019 This breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from Delph and his mother Donna, who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions. \u2018It\u2019s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training,\u2019 he said. \u2018At one point, it would take three buses and one train. But it\u2019s worked out well. I\u2019ve always been pushed hard to succeed. To get those buses, it was nothing.\u2019 As soon as he was able, he bought his mother a house. \u2018She\u2019s my hero,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018We didn\u2019t have a car, so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me. She was just a great Mum and a great role model.\u2019 Delph speaks to the media at an England press conference ahead of the midweek clash with Italy. Determination is a recurring theme for Delph, who swapped hometown Bradford for Leeds at the age of 11 and then joined Villa for \u00a36million in 2009, only to be hit by serious knee injuries. \u2018I ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and (knee surgeon) Andy Williams managed to save that,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I got back quite quickly and then broke down four times. I did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles; the left ankle, the right ankle a few times"}

Murray and Bjorkman have a good relationship and Bjorkman is looking forward to working with Murray and his main coach Amelie Mauresmo.", "article": "Andy Murray is not sure about Jonas Bjorkman's dancing but is confident the Swede will prove a valuable addition to his coaching team. The 42-year-old is to join Murray for a trial week at some point in the next month with a view to working with the Scot on a permanent basis alongside his main coach Amelie Mauresmo. The exact timing of that week is up in the air because Bjorkman is currently competing on Let's Dance, the Swedish version of Strictly Come Dancing. Andy Murray talks to his main coach Amelie Mauresmo during a training session in Indian Wells. The Scot, who could add Jonas Bjorkman to his team, practices his serve with coach Mauresmo watching on. Murray and Mauresmo take a moments rest during training ahead of Murray's Indian Wells challenge. Murray, whose mother Judy was a high-profile contestant on the last series of the British show, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I haven't seen him dance yet but apparently he's one of the favourites to win so he must be all right.' With Mauresmo only committed to working with Murray for 25 weeks a year, the world number four has made finding an additional coach a priority. The role had been filled under Ivan Lendl and then Mauresmo by his long-time friend Dani Vallverdu until the pair went their separate ways at the end of last season. The aim will be for Bjorkman to travel with Murray during the weeks when Mauresmo is unavailable, while they will also work together at certain times of the year. Murray said: 'We've agreed for him to work with us for a week just to try and see how it goes. Normally when I've started working with coaches I've done that. 'I know him very well from when he played. He was one of the older guys when I came on the tour and he was very good to me. He's a very nice person, good sense of humour. And he was an exceptional tennis player who made the most of his ability. Former world No 4 Jonas Bjorkman will join up with Team Murray for a trial week as assistant coach. 'A lot of Swedes turn out to be good coaches. They've got a good mindset, they're very calm individuals and extremely hard workers. Hopefully when we try it out together it works well.' Bjorkman reached number four in the singles rankings and number one in doubles, winning nine grand slam titles. Since retiring in 2008 he has worked in the media, as a coach with Sweden's Davis Cup team and behind the scenes at the ATP tournaments in Bastad and Stockholm. He becomes the latest Swede to take up a high-profile coaching role in men's tennis after Magnus Norman, who guided Stan Wawrinka to the Australian Open title last year, and Roger Federer's part-time mentor Stefan Edberg. Bjorkman agreed with Murray's assessment of Swedish strengths but also said he hoped to bring energy and fun to training sessions. Andy Murray celebrates after securing victory for Great Britain against the USA in the Davis Cup in Glasgow. Recalling how he became friends with Murray, Bjorkman said: 'I always spent quite a lot of time around Tim (Henman). 'When Andy came along, he was going to be the new superstar, I met him straight away and we connected well. 'He's a great guy, great sense of humour. Both of us like to have a little bit of a trash talk, we are interested in other sports. The only negative was he beat me twice. But I'm really looking forward to it.' Bjorkman revealed he has been speaking to Mauresmo on the phone and believes they are singing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to Murray's game. Andy Murray takes aim with a serve as he prepares for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. 'It feels great,' he said. 'I really like the way she believes Andy should play and how they've been working. 'Andy's in a great situation now, he played phenomenal tennis in Australia. The match against (Tomas) Berdych I believe was the best since his injury. He's at his prime with his age and has some interesting years ahead of him.' Murray and Mauresmo are currently in Indian Wells for the first Masters tournament of the season, where he will begin his campaign this weekend against Canadian Vasek Pospisil. The Scot, meanwhile, has also committed to playing at the ATP tournament in Washington in August as part of his build-up to the US Open.

But before her arrival, the world's three fastest horses, all Australian, will race for the $1 million prize at Flemington on what is dubbed 'Super Saturday'. The young bucks and fabulous fillies, however, will be on show on course and around it too, with Ladies Day at Rosehill. The best horses have been put through their paces at trackwork this week ahead of going on show on Super Saturday across Melbourne and Sydney. The battle to be the world's best.\u00a0Lankan Rupee enjoys a hose down after his trackwork session at Caulfield ahead of lining up in the Group One Newmarket Handicap at Flemington's 'Super Saturday' meeting. The ATC International Ambassador, Nicole Richie, is scheduled to arrive in Sydney next week for day two of the Golden Slipper Carnival. The world\u2019s highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee from the Mick Price stable and Terravista, trained by Joe Pride, are at the top of betting for the $1 million Group 1 Lexus Newmarket Handicap. Lankan Rupee has returned in stellar form, fresh from a triumphant first-up run in the Black Caviar Lightning on February 21. He will have to lump top weight of 58.5kg as he aims to become only the fifth horse to record consecutive Newmarket wins, after saluting last March. A winner of 11 of 21 career starts, Lankan Rupee will have to equal Hay List\u2019s metric weight-carrying record if he is to muster a sixth career Group 1. To do that he will have to overcome\u00a0Terravista, who is ridden by the in-form Hugh Bowman. Joe Pride's star sprinter was a very impressive winner of the Group 1 Darley Classic over the Newmarket course and distance during the Melbourne Cup Carnival. To his great advantage, he has two kilos less than Lankan Rupee, in trying to beat history by becoming the first horse since 1917 to taste first-up success in the Newmarket. And if they don't salute, waiting in the wings to claim the title of world's best is another star, Chautauqua, who will carry 55.5kg. The impressive grey has not yet won a Group 1 in 11 starts, but has saluted twice in Group 2 events. Trained by the Hawkes triumvirate, the four-year-old was beaten less than a neck by Terravista and finished ahead of Lankan Rupee in the Darley Classic. 'This year\u2019s Newmarket is shaping as one of the most exciting renewals in history with the world\u2019s three highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee, Terravista and Chautauqua, all expected to take their place on Super Saturday,' Racing Victoria handicapper Neil Jennings said. ATC Ambassador Erika Heynatz poses with Aussie at Rosehill Gardens ahead of Ladies Day, day one of the Golden Slipper Carnival. Lankan Rupee will take of Terravista and up-and-coming sprinters Chautauqua and Brazen Beau in the million dollar sprint down the Flemington straight on Saturday. Up for grabs is title of world's best sprinter. Jockey Craig Williams appears happy with his mount in the $1 million Australian Cup. But Protectionist, the reigning Melbourne Cup champ will need to overcome favourite Happy Trails, among others, to make history at Flemington on Super Saturday. Leading jockey Craig Williams leads 2014 Melbourne Cup winner Protectionist out of his stalls ahead of his run in the $1 million Australian Cup. Craig Williams will take the ride on the Kris Lee-trained Protectionist, who is aiming to equal the likes of Makybe Diva and Fiorente as horses to have claimed the elusive Melbourne Cup and Australian Cup double. And there's no knock on the Chris Waller trained Brazen Beau either, carrying the lighweight 52kg and with star jockey Joao Moreira in the saddle, he will be primed for the 1200m event, off the back of a second to Lankan Rupee. The Kris Lees-trained Protectionist has drawn barrier three as he looks to emulate the deeds of 2013 Melbourne Cup winner Fiorente, by claiming the $1 million Australian Cup in his following preparation. 16 horses accepted for the $1 million 2000 metre Group 1, which will be one of the highlights of Flemington\u2019s \u2018Super Saturday\u2019.

And even though the council apparently agreed the positioning was rather inconvenient, officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up for the event. Mr Meakin now has to wait until tomorrow, the end of the local Mid-Lent Fair, to re-open the cafe. He said: 'What customer wants to sit having a coffee and look out the window at the back end of a giant fairground ride. It was just really inconsiderate to say the least. 'Everybody thought we were closed anyway. You couldn't get anywhere near the shop really. It was unbelievable. 'It was literally 3ft away from the window. Who could ever think that was a good idea?' Mr Meakin, who runs the cafe with wife Jessica, said the 'barmy' decision forced him to close the cafe, a move which he said cost his business at least \u00a31,000. Clear view: Mr Meakin could barely see out of the window after the ride was put up directly outside the cafe. Prettier sight: The area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs (pictured) for al fresco diners was also completely taken over. He claimed the ride had so badly obstructed the view that the entire premises was plunged into darkness. And the area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs for al fresco diners was also completely taken over by the attraction. He added:\u00a0'I had no choice but to close on health and safety grounds. Takings are down over a \u00a31,000 at least. 'My worry was if we had to evacuate a hoard of people would just have been blocked off by a ride and a lamppost. 'The council just don't seem to consider small local businesses here. It was a barmy decision.' Baffled: Paul Meakin, 31, pictured with his wife and business partner Jessica, said he had to close the business for most of the week, a move which cost him around \u00a31,000 in profit. Mr Meakin was forced to close the caf\u00e9 early on Monday afternoon. It remained closed all day Tuesday, Wednesday and today. He is due to reopen tomorrow, once the fair has ended. He said: 'The ride position was just not acceptable so we left it until the council came back and had a proper look. 'When somebody from the council came they agreed and said it's unacceptable so I don't know how someone could have said it was before. 'I used to get nervous about the fair coming but because the past few years it's been the same ride it didn't cause me any concern. Even though South Kesteven District Council agreed the ride (pictured in use at the fair) had been positioned incorrectly, Mr Meakin said officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up. 'In terms of compensation the council said they would just look into it. 'We asked to see copies of the risk assessments so we knew we weren't liable if anything happened but they said they couldn't provide them.' He added: 'We have been here for four years and it's been the same ride every year but it's been in a sensible place. Regular customer Frank Rhimes, 66, said: 'Somebody at the council needs their heads examining. 'I couldn't believe it when I turned up for my daily coffee and saw this massive ride looming over the shop. It just makes you wonder who makes these kind of decisions.' A South Kesteven District Council spokeswoman said: 'We are facilitating a solution between the showman responsible for the ride and the cafe owner.'"}

Williams, 55, is currently suspended from NBC without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina, among others. But prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with Nightly News after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old desk. Brian Williams agreed to a five-year contract after being persuaded by NBC News President Deborah Turness, who gifted him with\u00a0veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old writing desk. And few years ago, Williams told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno. Burke turned down Williams's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center, which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show. Instead, the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons, according to New York Magazine. Williams pushed on, however, and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman. Moonves wasn't interested, sources told New York Magazine. Williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by NBC News president Deborah Turness. Though they first clashed - because Williams was used to having the final say over a show's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another. Brian Williams suggested succeeding both Jay Leno (left) and David Letterman (right). CEOs from NBC and CBS turned down his offers. Williams sent Turness a note over the holidays that read, '2015 is going to be our year together', according to New York Magazine. He went on to agree to a new five-year anchor deal, during the same dinner Turness\u00a0presented him with Murrow's old writing desk. She had found the 1940s desk through a Los Angeles-based antique dealer. And less than two months later, Williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation. This comes just after speculations that Katie Couric might be\u00a0is in talks NBC's incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return by replacing Williams on the Nightly News. 'It makes sense (that she could come back) because she is so closely associated with the brand,' a source told the New York Daily News.

Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment, and advocates believe it is healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. However, the study found that the risks of consuming raw milk outweigh the potential benefits, and it is safer to discourage the consumption of raw milk.", "article": "The trend for\u00a0fresh, local, unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk. This is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version. Raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk-related food borne illnesses, even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the US drink it. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. \u00a0Advocates believe it is s healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. But a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised \u2013 heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same. Advocates believe that raw milk, which contains more natural antibodies, proteins, and bacteria than pasteurised milk, is healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. They argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. But the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate. They claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious Salmonella, Campylobacter,and Listeria species along with the most dangerous form of E. coli. These bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans, including diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, fevers, and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death. 'The risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well-established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences,' says Cissy Li, a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Based on our findings, we discourage the consumption of raw milk, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women, and children.' Pasteurisation involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination, dairy operations, cow udders, or other sources. Treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future conducted an analysis of 81 published scientific journal articles,. 'Ultimately, the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurised milk,' says report lead author Benjamin Davis, also a graduate student in environmental health sciences. 'Although potential benefits related to the consumption of raw milk would benefit from further investigation, we believe that, from a public health perspective, it is a far safer choice to discourage the consumption of raw milk.' The study comes as incidents on three farms selling raw milk  led to E.coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28. Last year, the Food Standards Agency in the UK suspended sales of raw cows\u2019 drinking milk and any product made from the milk, including cheese, at all three farms."}

It comes after two teenage brothers were also discovered doing the same thing earlier this month. A third teenager has been caught by authorities trying to join Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East. The incident happened on March 12 and charges have not been laid against the boy. The boy is the third teenager government officials have intercepted among about 200 people stopped from heading overseas to become foreign fighters with terrorist groups. He has since returned to his family, with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO investigating the matter. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said while it was hard to believe people who had grown up in Australia's free and open society could be susceptible to brain washing by extremist groups such as Islamic State, it was clearly happening.

The latest teenager to be caught were trying to fly to the Middle East like notorious extremists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Mohamed Elomar (above) has caused a stir on social media after posting photos of him with weapons and severed heads. Meanwhile Khaled Sharrouf made international headlines after he posted photos of his children posing with guns. The above photograph is Sharrouf posing with his children in front of an Islamic State flag and rifles. The two boys were stopped on the night of March 6, Mr Dutton said at the time of the revelation. Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State.

Aldi is launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear, with this whole outfit costing just \u00a3180. The range of clothes that includes a trousers, boots for \u00a329.99, motorcycle tank bags at a bargain \u00a312.99 and gloves at \u00a319.99,  is sure to be snapped up in minutes when it's released on March 8. The store will also sell thermal under layers including a long-sleeved top and long johns. And not only are the clothes a much more affordable option for motorbiking enthusiasts, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. The pass zone for the Level 2 impact abrasion test is seven seconds of abrasion resistance in body zones 1 and 2, which include the shoulders and elbows. Aldi's jacket and trousers exceed these requirements, achieving over 13 seconds of abrasion resistance across all four zones of the garment. John Chatterton-Ross, of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), the governing body for motorcycle racing, said: 'This is the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices. Not only are the clothes an affordable option, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. Pictured: High-standard textile jacket, \u00a380. 'The protection offered by Aldi's products exceeds the requirements for impact abrasion and impact cut resistance demanded by the European standard for zones 1 and 2 in all zones. 'Few products on the market can match this. Often, even in premium brands, it is only the protectors that are certified, not the rest of the garment. 'It is great to see that with Aldi's motorcycling jacket and trousers, safety does not have to come with a high price tag.' The motorcycling range comes after a whole host of specialist ranges launched by the supermarket - from Equestrian and fishing gear, to yoga and even ski clothing and accessories. And just last June, the chain even brought\u00a0the world's most expensive beef, Wagyu, to its aisles at \u00a36.99 for a sirloin steak.

Pictured: Gloves, \u00a319.99. Tony Baines of Aldi said of the new range: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone'. Pictured: Touring boots, \u00a329.99. Normally, luxury stores, gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering \u00a3100 per kilo - putting it out of reach for most families. The move to offer luxury food and clothing at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the 'big four' - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Tony Baines of Aldi said: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone - giving our customers the opportunity to stock up for less without compromising on quality. 'The motorcycling range is of no exception and we're proud of the level of safety we've achieved at this unbeatable price point.'"}

But text speak has not been the disaster for language many feared and one leading linguist has claimed it actually improves people's writing and spelling. Professor David Crystal, an honorary professor at Bangor University, said those who text regularly were found to be 'concentrating their minds' on the relationship between sounds and  written words. The linguist, who has written more than 100 books on the English language, pointed out a new generation is 'constantly' reading and writing online. 'People say text messaging will harm your spelling. No...It helps you to spell better,' he said at the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai according to the Daily Telegraph. 'This is because it focuses your mind on the connection between sound and letters. 'The best texters are the best spellers. 'People say young people don't read and write any more.'They may not necessarily read... Shakespeare or Charles Dickens, but have you ever seen a teenager not reading? 'Young people read probably more than I did when I was that age.' He said the digital age had not necessarily heralded a 'linguistic revolution' in the way critics had predicted and said the'moral panic' of the potential change has not been justified. Professor Crystal's studies have found around 2,000 new words developed as a result of the digital age, including terms such as blog and twittersphere. He said  additions have so far not had a major, or negative, impact on the English language, which has more than one million  words. The linguist said many abbreviations such as 'c u l8r' are not commonly used by modern teenagers. Professor Crystal also claimed that hashtags, used on Twitter, are simply a new method of managing and classifying information and were likely to stay. Professor David Crystal dismissed claims youngsters were not reading as much today as they had done in the past. His comments dispel previous claims abbreviated language was worsening teenagers' grasp of the English language. In 2012 a study claimed the grammar standards of school pupils aged 10-12 had slipped as a result of constantly using shortened phrases. Researchers urged parents not to communicate with their children in text speak to avoid their abilities suffering more. Last year it was claimed Britons spent more time using mobile phones, computers and handheld tablets than they did sleeping. Information gathered by Ofcom, the television watchdog, found the average adult slept for eight hours 21 minutes but spent 20 minutes longer connected to technology."}

Other researchers found fault with the study, which looked at how Democrats and Republicans differ in positive language in speeches entered into the Congressional Record, photos in the congressional directory, tweets by followers of the two different political parties, LinkedIn photos associated with advocacy groups, and answers to psychological satisfaction-with-life surveys. The scientists found Democrats in Congress and liberals in general used a statistically significant amount of more positive language and smiled more with their eyes in photographs, while conservatives self-reported more satisfaction with life, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Science. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.  Conservatives say they are happier, but liberals show more cheer in smiles, word choice and even emoticon use, claims a new scientific study. The researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the Congressional Record, concentrating on 2013. Democrats used 13.6 positive words for every negative and Republicans used 11.5 positive words per negative. 'We're not saying liberals are happier, they behave happier,' said study co-author Peter Ditto, a professor of psychology at the University of California Irvine. 'But conservatives report being happier.' Other studies have reported that conservatives tend to score higher on tests that rate how satisfied with life they are, but University of California Irvine graduate student Sean Wojcik, the study's lead author, decided to look deeper. He looked at other indicators of happiness: words and facial expressions. The researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the Congressional Record, concentrating on 2013. Democrats used 13.6 positive words for every negative and Republicans used 11.5 positive words per negative. That higher rate for liberals was apparent regardless of who controlled Congress or the White House, Ditto said. For a laughing Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., this rings true: 'A lot of what seems to fuel Republican energy is anger-based. They're angry about Iran. They're angry about Obama.... And you hear that on the floor constantly.' That's not the feeling at the office of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., where a sign above the congressman's door reads 'Fighting for Freedom and Having Fun.' His spokesman Ken Grubbs said, 'A day at the office here... is never without lots of laughs.' Political scientist Jack Pitney said the Wojcik study was so off kilter that it seemed to be a parody, adding 'I don't think too many people will take this seriously.' A professor at Claremont McKenna College, he had many questions about the way the study was conducted and said conservatives in general want less government so this would be reflected in the language they use when talking about government. One study team member, who initially wasn't told what the project was about, examined congressional portraits to rate their facial emotions, an accepted technique in psychology. Democrats and Republicans had similar smiles around the mouth, but the more telling features for happiness are the muscles around the eyes and there Democrats looked cheerier, Wojcik said. He also found more positive language \u2014 and emoticon use \u2014 in tweets from people who followed only Democratic Twitter accounts versus only Republican account followers. Rep.  Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., disagrees with his colleague on the other side Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who spoke against H.R. 4278, the Ukraine Support Act, during the House Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the bill on Capitol Hill in Washington.   For a laughing Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, the study rings true. Several outside psychology experts told The Associated Press that while it was interesting, they didn't find the study convincing. They faulted some techniques, did not see a significant difference between the two ideologies' scores and they criticized the researchers for mixing long-term happiness in self-reporting with momentary good moods in pictures and language. 'The observed differences are quite small,' said Robert Emmons of the University of California at Davis. 'Happiness is the norm for both' Democrats and Republicans.

This contradicts Mark Zuckerberg's 2010 claim that the age of privacy is over. Young people may post in public forums, but this does not mean they have no desire for privacy.", "article": "Teenagers are tired of sharing every detail of their lives online and are taking increasing steps to safeguard their privacy on social media, a report has revealed. Young people are un-tagging pictures, writing false posts and even adopting parallel identities in a bid to keep their personal information safe, according to the Market Research Society. They have even resorted to posting deliberately vague statements on their accounts - known as 'vague-booking' - to prompt real friends to respond privately for further details. Scroll down for video. Vague-booking: Young people are deliberately posting vague statements and false information in a bid to keep their personal data private, research has found. The findings contradict Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's claims in 2010 that the age of privacy is over - and no longer a'social norm'. The report, by Colin Strong of the MRS Delphi Society, says the rise of apps like Snapchat - which erases pictures after a short amount of time - show teenagers are increasingly concerned about what strangers see. His report says: 'There is an almost universally held view that teenagers simply don\u2019t care enough about online privacy.' At face value, this appears to be true, as many young people flood public social media accounts like Twitter and Instagram with endless streams of selfies and personal information. Mr Strong cites the example of Paris Brown, who was forced to resign from her position as the country's first youth police crime commissioner in 2013 after a series of ill-advised tweets she had posted years before emerged. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claimed people had become more comfortable with sharing private information online. Jane Frost, chief executive of the MRS, told The Sunday Times\u00a0that she estimates a third of Twitter users have a private account, only shared with close friends, as well as a public persona. She had many used several fake identities for things like video gaming, while closely guarding accounts made using their real names. Ms Frost said the findings will pose problems for businesses, who will not be to take consumers for granted. Mr Strong adds that just because young people post things in public forums, it does not mean have no desire for privacy. 'Just because it's in a public space doesn't mean they want publicity,' he said. His views are in stark contrast to those of Mr Zuckerberg, the chief executive of the world's biggest social network. Speaking at the Crunchie Awards in 2010, he claimed people had grown more comfortable sharing their private information online. He said: 'People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. 'That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.' He explained the rise of social media reflected the changing attitudes of people. 'When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard, the question a lot of people asked was, 'why would I want to put any information on the internet at all? Why would I want to have a website?' 'Then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way, and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information.'"}

Raid: U.S. Marshalls and sheriff's deputies are seen surrounding the home of Corey Tanner in Flager County, Florida, serving a warrant for attempted murder. Ready: Officers are heard shouting at the 24-year-old serial criminal to surrender and walk out. Officers are then heard repeatedly telling Tanner to leave the home with his hands up while getting into position, but the demands are ignored. The four youngsters said to be in the house at the time are then allowed out, leaving Tanner in the bedroom. The sheriff's department then drives a patrol round with his brother, John, in the back seat in a bid to talk Tanner out of the house without harm.

In fact as well as gold, faeces contains platinum, silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Researchers now hope to'mine' sewage reducing the need to mine raw metals from the ground, while reducing pollution by recycling human waste. Scientists have discovered a literal goldmine of precious metals in human poo.The US researchers are investigating ways of flushing out the valuable minerals, including gold, silver and rare elements such as palladium and vanadium. Pictured are microscopic gold-rich and lead-rich particles in human waste. Taking a lesson from industrial mining, the scientists are experimenting with chemicals called leachates that are used to pull metals out of rock. Some of these chemicals have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment. But in controlled conditions, they could safely be used to recover metals from treated solid waste, Dr Smith claims. In the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum, silver and gold observing microscopic-sized metal particles in biosolids. Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (\u00a38.7 million) worth of metals. In 1999 the UK produced over 1,130,000 tonnes of sludge dry solids, which averages to about 20kg generated by each person. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (\u00a3510 million) a year. Dr Kathleen Smith of the US Geological Survey said: 'If you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests, and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements, that's a win-win. 'There are metals everywhere. They are in your hair care products, detergents, even nanoparticles that are put in socks to prevent bad odours.' Yet all end up at the sewage works and many metals end up in the leftover solid waste. At treatment plants, wastewater goes through a series of physical, biological and chemical processes and the end products are treated water and biosolids. In the US alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills. Dr Smith added: 'We have a two-pronged approach. 'In one part of the study, we are looking at removing some regulated metals from the biosolids that limit their use for land application. If Britain's waste was mined it could be worth $762 million (\u00a3510 million) a year.\u00a0Previous research estimated the waste from one million Americans could contain as much as $12 million (\u00a38.7 million) worth of metals. 'In the other part of the project, we're interested in collecting valuable metals that could be sold, including some of the more technologically important metals, such as vanadium and copper that are in cell phones, computers and alloys.' The study aims to use the same chemicals, called leachates, which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock. While some of these leachates have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment, in a controlled setting, they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste. In the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum, silver and gold observing microscopic-sized metal particles in biosolids using a scanning electron microscope. 'The gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit' meaning if that amount were in rock, it might be commercially viable to mine it. Dr Smith added that 'the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from biosolids needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.' The study presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) involved collecting samples from small towns in the Rocky Mountains, rural communities and big cities. For a more comprehensive picture, they plan to combine their information with many years' worth of existing data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency and other groups at the Geological Survey."}

A retired NYPD officer vacationing in Puerto Rico with his family this weekend was swept out to sea in front of his horrified wife and children after he heroically saved a 12-year-old boy from drowning. The body of Jose 'Joe' Rosario, 47, washed ashore Monday, two days after he jumped into the water off Playa de Jobos to save his son\u2019s friend who was struggling to stay afloat in choppy waters. Rosario, a retired Manhattan police detective, was able to pull the 12-year-old to safety, but he proved no match for a powerful wave. Leisha Chen, Rosario's stepdaughter, said the boy urged his rescuer to grab onto him, but she said Rosario was afraid the child would lose his grip and go under. 'That's when another wave hit and my stepfather got pulled out further,' Chen, a married mother of one, told the New York Post. Rosario's teenage daughter, Anais, detailed in a heart-breaking Facebook post how she, her brother and their mother helplessly looked on from the beach as the 47-year-old father of three floundered in rough seas. \u2018My dad did everything he could and helped my brothers [sic] friend get out of the ocean but he couldn't get out himself,\u2019 Anais Rosario wrote. \u2018The current took him away and after a while we couldn't see him anymore. The coast guard and the cops have been looking for him since but he hasn't turned up. Family man: Rosario's family, including (L to R) daughter Anais, stepdaughter Leisha Chan, his young son and his wife, looked on in horror as the 20-year NYPD veteran floundered in the surf. Death in paradise: Rosario jumped into the water off Playa de Jobos, where the family were vacationing, to rescue his son's friend. \u2018I don't know what's going to happen and if he's still out there or not but no matter what he is a hero and always has been.\u2019 On Monday, when Mr Rosario's lifeless body turned up on the beach in Puerto Rico, his devastated daughter paid tribute to her dad in another touching post. 'Rip dad, I will love you forever and you will always be in my heart and with me wherever I go. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,\u2019 Anais wrote, expressing hope that one day they will reunite in heaven. Saturday was not the first time that Jose Rosario, a 20-year veteran of the NYPD, put himself in harm's way to save a child\u2019s life. Several years ago, the retired detective had rescued his stepdaughter's young cousin who was drowning in a pool at a Puerto Rico resort, located about a mile from the spot where he died Saturday. New York's finest: Rosario (pictured left and right with his daughter) retired from the force after serving as a detective for two decades. Noble end: Leisha Chen, pictured here on her wedding day, detailed how her stepfather (far right) was able to pull the drowning boy to safety. The child urged the father of three to grab onto him, but Rosario was afraid the 12-year-old would lose his grip. 'That's who he was,' Leisha Chen told the New York Post. 'He would give his life to anybody.' The Washingtonville Youth Football and Cheerleading League, where Rosario volunteered as an equipment director, paid tribute to the brave ex-cop Monday. \u2018Today the Wizards family has lost one of our own,\u2019 a statement from the youth league read. \u2018Joe Rosario, great father, great coach, a great man.

But in fact these ethereal photographs were taken in real life, and show extreme sportsman and climber Stephan Siegrist, 43, ascending the\u00a0Voringsfossen icefall which is part of a gigantic glacier in Eidfjord, Norway. The stunning images were captured by fellow mountaineer and photographer Thomas Senf. While the 500ft frozen waterfall is regularly scaled by climbers during daylight, he said he wanted to capture the beauty of the falls by night. Scroll down for video. Spot the climber:\u00a0Stephan Siegrist, 43, scales the\u00a0Voringsfossen icefall, a 500ft-tall frozen waterfall that forms part of a\u00a0glacier in Norway. There he is: While hundreds of climbers attempt to scale the fall during the day, few attempt it at night. With bright lights illuminating his efforts from below, Mr\u00a0Siegrist appears to be on the set of a sci-fi movie. Stunning: Mr Siegrist (pictured) trained as an apprentice carpenter before falling in love with mountaineering during a ski trip as a teenager. He gave up woodwork aged 26, and has earned his living from climbing ever since. He said: 'Photography and filming at night is a big challenge because of the lighting. The ways to play with the factors of light, time and environment fascinate me endlessly. 'I had considered for a long time how to work with artificial light, which is normally only possible in a photo studio, in major mountains. 'The transparency and reflective properties of ice in the sun had often caught my eye. With its virtually unlimited number of icefalls, Norway seemed like the perfect place to put those ideas into practice.' Climber Mr Siegrist was born in\u00a0Meikirch, Switzerland, near to Bern, which is within sight of the northern Alps. While he trained as a carpenter, he fell in love with mountaineering after a skiing trip as a teenager. Out of this world: Mr Senf (pictured bottom right in both images) was primarily a climber in the early stages of his career, but began to incorporate photography into his adventures, and took these images during one trip in 2012. Frozen solid: For a large part of the year the\u00a0Voringsfossen icefall is liquid, but during the winter months the bitterly cold air freezes it solid, allowing climbers to attempt to scale it. Aged 26 he gave up woodwork, became a professional mountain guide, and has made a living from climbing ever since. Over the course of a near 20-year career he has racked up hundreds of climbing hours, making first ascents on all seven continents. As well as ice climbing, as demonstrated in these photographs, he also specialises in big-wall climbing - scaling sheer rock faces that usually require more than one day to ascend - and bouldering - climbing without the use of safety harnesses or ropes. Meanwhile photographer Mr\u00a0Senf qualified in mechanical engineering, but moved to Switzerland aged 21 to pursue his passion for mountaineering. Adventurer: Mr Senf, who took an expedition to the icefall with Mr Siegrist in order to photograph it, is pictured left, and right during a climb. Starting out purely as a climber, he and a group of friends made two first ascents of peaks in the Himalayas, before he began incorporating photography into his adventures. He captured these stunning images of Mr Siegrist during a trip to Norway in 2012. He added: 'During the summer months, water tumbles from the cliff tops. Come winter, this majestic landscape is transformed as the waters are suspended mid-flow creating icefalls. 'Climbers frequently scale them during daylight hours, but we wanted to capture their full beauty and colour at night.'"}

It sounds like something from a Disney fairy tale, but this is surprisingly all available in Mount Crosby, Queensland (BYO prince charming). Fit with a drawbridge at the entrance and three split level air conditioners throughout, this modern day fortress is available for rent for $550 per week.

The medieval property is surrounded by small towers on top of the building known as turrets and pointed rectangular windows. A favourite feature of the property is the drawbridge that opens at the entrance and reveals a large timber door. From fine-grained slate floors to long pointed rectangular windows outside of turrets, everything inside the castle, down to the finest detail, illustrates the strong medieval theme. Norma Trench from Brisbane West Rentals told Daily Mail Australia that the background of the Brisbane castle and its owners really is incredibly romantic. 'She was swept off her feet, within four months of meeting, they were engaged,' she said. 'He was her prince charming, so they decided to build a castle.' The castle is located at 79 Sheep Camp Road, Mount Crosby in Queenland and is 22 kilometres South-West of Brisbane CBD. Ben and Penelope Crossman kept the home's original foundations and renovated it in 2009 to resemble their dream castle. The bathroom basins are dark timber and there are old fashioned vanities scattered throughout, the tiles are mostly slate. The Crossman's have relocated to the Gold Coast for work and hope to rent to property out to tenants who will appreciate the fortress's charm.

{"abstract": "Ramsey Nouah is a Nigerian movie superstar who has starred in dozens of films and won several accolades. He has seen Nollywood change and grow over the years, and believes that the current government has contributed immensely to the growth of the industry. He is passionate about his art and is considering a career in directing or humanitarian work in the future.", "article": "(CNN)It's probably the most important advice Nigerian movie superstar Ramsey Nouah ever received: \"My friend said,\" Nouah recalls,\"'you look like a great actor, why don't you act?'\" That was some 25 years ago, when Nouah was looking for funds to cover his school examination fees. Nouah took his friend's suggestion and started auditioning for TV shows. He quickly landed a role in a successful soap opera, and soon after he made his debut in Nollywood, Nigeria's mighty movie making machine. Today, Nouah is one of the industry's most popular names, having starred in dozens of films and won several accolades. His latest movie -- \"Thy Will Be Done,\" by director Obi Emelonye -- became last month the first Nollywood film to premiere at London's BFI IMAX, Britain's biggest cinema screen. CNN's African Voices caught up with Nouah to talk about Nigeria's film industry and present him with the questions you sent via the #AskRamsey and #CNNAfrica hashtags. CNN: How have you seen Nollywood change and grow over the years? Ramsey Nouah: There have been several phases in Nollywood, like in everything in life. We started off Nollywood almost like making bread out of stone; there was nothing, no investment, no structure, nothing on the ground to actually help the industry but we've brought it this far and we are very happy. CNN: How do you see the political situation in Nigeria and what do you think about the recent security tensions? RN: I find it quite dicey, it's a case of uncertainty, not knowing what is going to happen...however I'm actually endorsing the present government because he [president Goodluck Jonathan] has contributed immensely to the growth of our industry -- call me selfish call me what but I've been in this industry for 25 years, no government ever spoke about my industry like this one. He gave us audience, he listened to us, he gave several grants to help the industry, he sent so many of the practitioners outside to big film schools... he's giving money for distribution -- so for all these reasons. There was a point where there was a nosedive, when it was hitting the rocks because it was predominantly dependent on DVDs, and the quality of the production was poor. It was successful up to a point until piracy came in and intellectual properties weren't protected and practitioners weren't getting their worth. But now there is the cinema, which is growing drastically in Nigeria and that has really helped bring back Nollywood. So I would say right now it's getting better... because cinema culture is beginning to come -- if you're going to shoot a cinema movie then you've got to be thinking about the quality of the production and of the story. CNN: So what have you learned throughout this journey? RN: I learned a whole lot of lessons, when the chips were high -- many people knew me and everything but I was so deeply passionate about the industry that I wanted growth and I wanted something better. I wanted Nollywood to look like Hollywood and Bollywood, I wanted it to have that appeal... and at some point in my industry it wasn't happening. Because I'm one of the very top actors, knowing that with my influence I could make a difference, I decided at some point... to be like \"look guys, lets upgrade, the new technologies are coming,  how do we move forward.\" Most of the people I was working with wanted to live in that mindset, and I felt \"no, I need to make a change,\"... and then I was just picking movies deliberately that I knew would stand the test of time as I grow old. Ramsey Nouah: I think my greatest inspiration is my passion for my art. My passion is my major drive, I love what I do and I like the competition, I like the circumstances that surround my industry and how to make it better -- if it was too easy and too fluid, maybe if it wasn't as challenging, my passion would have died but I think the challenges make it stronger for me. Ramsey Nouah: I'm not very certain -- I've come to learn about life that never say never. I was thinking maybe in the next 10 years I'll probably be behind the camera, directing and working on my own flicks but at the same time,of course, if in the next 10 years I am still good enough to tell a story and get into characters then I will still be there acting. Besides that, of course, humanitarian stuff mostly. Ramsey Nouah: I think it's a public service kind of thing that everyone is beginning to think that \"OK, we can make a change\"... and most of my colleagues are thinking, \"if people believe in me that I can do it then I can make it happen.\" For me, I'm too much of a creative person than a politician so it's going to be really hard, but I never say never...

At 91, Lord Bramall \u2013 the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry \u2013 is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. Born in 1923, Lord Bramall's father came from a merchant family in the Potteries in Staffordshire, while his mother hailed from impoverished aristocracy. She would forever call him'my baby' \u2013 even when phoning his office while he was head of the Army. He captained Eton's cricket team, had two pictures displayed at the Royal Academy, and to his mother's chagrin, turned down a place at Oxford to join the Army. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Eton-educated Lord Bramall commanded a platoon at the D-Day landings and led the Army as chief of the general staff during the Falklands campaign.He was awarded the Military Cross in 1945. The headline to an earlier version of this article wrongly stated that Lord Bramall had been arrested. While the article made clear that this had not been the case, we are happy to set the record straight and apologise for any confusion caused."}

The American journeyman was handed a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition tests carried out in December and January. The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation. \u2018Goodbye Wayne \u2026 good riddance,\u2019 tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: \u2018My feelings are that he\u2019s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he\u2019s cheating, good riddance.\u2019 Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: \u2018Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke. Get out of the sport mate.\u2019 Murray later beat Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open and will face Spain\u2019s Feliciano Lopez in the quarter-finals. It was Murray\u2019s 496th win, equalling Tim Henman\u2019s record for a British man in the Open Era. After his victory, Murray spoke further on Odesnik's ban. He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells. 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago. Tennis has stepped up its drug-testing regime and introduced a biological passport, but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources. The fact that Odesnik was initially caught this time in December shows the value of more expensive out-of-competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments, where it is most expected."}

However, the El Ni\u00f1o conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and unlikely to bring substantially more rainfall than this spring. The NOAA said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean has been above average, and unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern Pacific ocean.", "article": "The world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited El Ni\u00f1o event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected. Scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean and have started to alter wind patterns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Ni\u00f1o will continue through the summer. The US National Oceanic and Atmosopheric Administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the Pacific Ocean (shown above) which indicates the arrival of\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o. However, they say that the El Ni\u00f1o conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and come at a time of the year when the influence of El Ni\u00f1o on weather patterns usually declines. This means that while El Ni\u00f1o conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer, it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring. El Ni\u00f1o is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. Usually the wind blows strongly from east to west, due to the rotation of the Earth, causing water to pile up in the western part of the Pacific. This pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific. However, in an El Ni\u00f1o, the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east. This causes the eastern Pacific to get warmer. But as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents, this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer, meaning the El Ni\u00f1o grows. This change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere. The NOAA said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting California. Some meteorologists, however, have warned that this El Ni\u00f1o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Ni\u00f1o to increase global temperatures. Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre, said: 'Based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure, we can now say that El Ni\u00f1o is here. 'Many climate prediction models show this weak El Ni\u00f1o continuing into summer.' The arrival of this El Ni\u00f1o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year, but the conditions failed to materialise. According to the Met Office El Ni\u00f1o conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to Europe during the Autumn and colder winter temperatures. The above diagram shows the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean on 25 Feburary 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average (marked by red) on that date. It can also make sourthern Europe wetter during the late summer and autumn. Perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east Asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in El Ni\u00f1o years. El Ni\u00f1o is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet. It is the result of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the Pacific Ocean. This cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years. When the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months, the NOAA officially classes it as El Ni\u00f1o conditions. California is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the Stevens Creek Reservoir (shown above). It is unlikely the El Ni\u00f1o will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought. The last El Ni\u00f1o, in 2009-2010, was a moderate to strong event. This brought freezing  weather to northern Europe in the winter of 2009/2010 and the UK was exceptionally cold. The Vancouver Winter Olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event. Other recent El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s \u00a0in 2002-2003,  2004-2005 and 2006-2007 have been weak to moderate in strength. The last very strong El Nino was 1997-1998 and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the United States, especially California. The NOAA said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean has been above average. They also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern Pacific ocean. In Late January and February there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical Pacific and forecasts for March suggest these will continue. The NOAA said that this mean the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index, which is uses to monitor the El Ni\u00f1o, has been a negative value"}

Falcao struck twice in four minutes for Colombia's second and third goals in a 6-0 thrashing of the world No 103-ranked side at the Bahrain National Stadium. The 29-year-old has been craving regular football having not started for his club since February 28 but delivered as he so often has for national team head coach Jose Pekerman. Radamel Falcao celebrates the second of his two goals for Colombia in their friendly against Bahrain. Out-of-favour Manchester United striker watches his first strike, a classy  volley, hit the bottom corner. 1 Arnoldo Iguaran 24 goals in 68 games. 2 Radamel Falcao 23 in 55. 3 Faustino Asprilla 20 in 57. 4 Freddy Rincon 17 in 84. 5 V\u00edctor Aristizabal 15 in 66. 6 Teofilo Gutierrez 14 in 37. Adolfo Valencia 14 in 37. 8 Ivan Valenciano 13 in 29. Antony de Avila 13 in 54. 10 James Rodriguez 12 in 32. Willington Jose Ortiz 12 in 49. First though, Falcao was the provider for  fellow striker Carlos Bacca to open the scoring on 14 minutes after Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado hit the post early on. Showing strength at the back post Falcao headed back to Bacca at the top of the six-yard box for the Sevilla marksman to drill home the finish. Captain Falcao then stepped up in the 32nd minute to get himself on the scoresheet with a clinical left-footed volley after a looping ball over the top of the flagging Bahrain defence. Falcao's second came moments later, again with a first-time finish, but this time after his explosive run between defenders was met with a well-weighted through ball. The strike, which it must be said took a significant deflection, took Falcao's international tally to 23 in 55 matches, just one short of his country's all-time top-scorer Arnoldo Iguaran's 24 from 68. Carlos Bacca drills home Colombia's first goal after a strong header from Falcao set him up. Falcao pierces through the hapless Bahraini defence on Thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time. Defender Abdulla Khaled Al-Haza'a brings down Falcao wide on the right during their friendly. After the break Borussia Dortmund's Adrian Ramos came on to add his second goal in as many international showings after a deft pass from Inter Milan's Fredy Guarin for 4-0. After Pekerman decided his star man had had enough after 72 minutes, Real Valladolid's Johan Mojica and Mexico-based Andres Renteria came off the bench to continue his work with goals five and six respectively to wrap up the mismatch. Despite his personal tally getting a boost, Falcao made a point to commend his team's effort after the match. 'Great victory today against Bahrain,' he wrote on his Instagram page. 'The most important think, the amazing team work!!! Go Colombia.' Falcao has scored just four times in 22 appearances since coming to Old Trafford on loan from Monaco and is almost certain to go elsewhere in the summer. Colombia's Andres Renteria, who plays for Santos Laguna in Mexico, beats\u00a0Said Ahmad Jaffer for the sixth. Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado shoots in Colombia's 6-0 win at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa. Bahrain keeper Sayed Mohammad Jafar makes himself big as Falcao comes close for a third. Colombia enjoy support away from home in Bahrain as they continue preparations for the Copa America. But with some sharp running and eagle eye for goal - at least twice - he showed glimpses of the reasons why the club thought him worthy of \u00a3260,000-a-week for this season. He should have left the pitch with a hat-trick, to be fair, with a golden chance at the far post on 49 minutes squandered following a poor Bahraini clearance from a free-kick. Falcao's last goal for Van Gaal's side came on January 31 when he scored United's second in a 3-1 defeat of Leicester. His most recently involvement under Van Gaal has been minimal - as an 83rd minute substitute in wins against Liverpool and Tottenham after being hooked after 68 minutes with United 1-0 up against Sunderland - as the Dutchman puts his faith in Wayne Rooney with support from Danny Welbeck and Juan Mata in the absence of Robin Van Persie. Colombia's match in Riffa served as a warm-up for the Copa America in Chile from June 11 to July 4 at which they will be hoping to see the return of Real Madrid's James Rodriguez who is still recovering foot injury."}

She said she then was able to use Lloyd's DNA to deduce the second DNA contributor. 'I did a comparison between the profile I deduced and the profile of Aaron Hernandez,' she said. 'I found that the profile from Aaron Hernandez matched the deduced DNA profile.' She then ran a statistical analysis and determined the likelihood it was someone else is one in more than a quadrillion. 'How many zeros does a quadrillion have?' prosecutor William McCauley asked her? 'One with 15 zeros after it,' she replied. He then asked her the world's population: 7 billion - and pointed out a quadrillion is one million times a quadrillion. But Hernandez lawyer James Sultan went after other DNA evidence in the case, including some collected from a spent shell casing found inside a car Hernandez rented. All smiles: Shayanna Jenkins, fiancee of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, leaves the courthouse during his murder trial on Friday. Police found the casing in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car, stuck to some blue bubble gum. An Enterprise employee said she found both items under the driver's seat of the car and threw them away. Biagiotti testified she found Hernandez DNA on the shell casing, but she also acknowledged she did not know the gum had been stuck to the shell before she did her test. 'Would you agree with me, Ms. Biagiotti, that there is a high likelihood that the DNA contained in the saliva on a chewed blue chewing gum would be transferred to that shell casing?' Sultan asked. 'Yes, I would agree with that,' she said. She also acknowledged that it is uncommon to find a testable amount of DNA on a spent cartridge casing and that the lab had never tested the chewing gum for DNA. Sultan also asked her if she had received a DNA profile for Hernandez co-defendant Ernest Wallace to compare it with evidence in the case. She said she had not. Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, listens during his murder trial on Friday. Also listen, at left, is Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee. Wallace and another man, Carlos Ortiz, have also been charged in the killing. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The court heard on Thursday that a tread mark found near the body of a man allegedly killed by Aaron Hernandez was made by a tire from a car rented by the ex-NFL star. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Todd Girouard, who specializes in tire track analysis, said the rear passenger side tire of a Nissan Altima that prosecutors say was rented by Hernandez matched a track found at a North Attleboro industrial park where the body of Odin Lloyd was found in June 2013. Ursula Ward, mother of victim Odin Lloyd, listens during the trial. Girouard, the state police trooper, said four small stones lodged in the tire of the Altima corresponded to tracks from the industrial park, based on his analysis, which included comparing photographs and test prints of the tire. He said the believed the tire on the Altima'made the impression.' Lloyd's sister testified earlier she saw her brother getting into a silver Nissan outside their home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood hours before he was killed. Prosecutors have shown surveillance video of Hernandez and Ortiz getting out of a silver Altima at a gas station in Canton, Massachusetts, hours before the murder. Also on Thursday, Patrick Quinn, a T-Mobile engineer, identified the locations of cell towers that connected with Lloyd's phone, beginning in Boston and moving to the coverage area of the North Attleborough industrial area, in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013. Earlier, Carol Martin Bailey, a resident of a condominium complex where Hernandez rented a unit in Franklin, Massachusetts, said she met a man she identified as George who appeared to be Ernest Wallace. The man told her he was moving into the next door unit with his cousin, she said, describing him as 'extremely nice'. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Todd Girouard"}

Clarke has announced that Sunday's trans-Tasman World Cup decider will be his final One Day International. The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years. Steve Smith is yet to be confirmed as Clarke's successor. Scroll down for video. Captain Michael Clarke announces his retirement from his one-day career after the Cricket World Cup final. However, that is expected to happen soon given Smith became Australia's third youngest Test captain during summer when Clarke was injured. Clarke suggested it wasn't fair to talk about who would takeover, but that it was important they had four years to mould the ODI side. 'I was very fortunate four years ago to get the opportunity to captain this one-day team and that was really good preparation for this World Cup,' Clarke said. 'The next Australian captain deserves the same opportunity. 'It really helped me having that preparation... to build my own team and set my own style up as a captain.'

Clarke reacts after missing a catch during the Semi Final match between Australia and India at SCG. Clarke arrives for a press conference before his team's training session for the Cricket World Cup final. Clarke had been thinking about the decision for some time but only made his mind up after returning home from last Thursday's semi-final against India. 'I think I got back to my house at about 12.30, (wife) Kyly was in bed and that's when I spoke to her about it,' he said. 'I told my teammates 10 minutes ago. I told the selectors and (Cricket Australia boss) James Sutherland about an hour ago. 'There's no doubt I could keep playing (ODI cricket) for the next couple of years.. but I know I've made the right decision.'

Clarke signals to his bench during the 2015 Cricket World Cup Semi Final match between Australia and India. Clarke will continue to play Test cricket. 'I'm hopeful it will prolong my Test career and that's a priority for me,' he said. 'I don't feel bad about saying I feel that Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. 'I see it as the pinnacle... I feel like I've still got a lot to offer the Australian Test team as captain.' Sutherland was full of praise for Clarke, adding that his decision came as'something of a surprise'. 'Michael leaves one-day cricket on his own terms, aiming to finish on an absolute high, in front of a packed MCG as a possible World Cup-winning captain,' Sutherland said. 'Regardless of the result, he will leave the one-day international game as one our greats.' Sunday's title decider will be Clarke's 245th ODI, ending a stellar career that started in 2003 and has netted 7907 runs at an average of 44.42. Only Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Mark Waugh have scored more ODI runs for Australia."}
{"abstract": "Craig Gordon, Celtic goalkeeper, is preparing for the Scottish League Cup Final with Dundee Utd by studying video analysis and practicing for the game. He previously won a cup with Hearts in 2006, and is determined to win this one as well. He reflects on his past experiences and is determined to take in the moment if they win the match.", "article": "The interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans. Simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak. For Craig Gordon, the old wisdom \u2013 fail to prepare, then prepare to fail \u2013 is more a way of life than a fleeting thought. To the uninitiated, tomorrow\u2019s final will be settled over 90, maybe 120 minutes, with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon is fully focused  ahead of the Scottish League Cup Final with Dundee Utd. But, long before the first ball is kicked in earnest, the Celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits. While much of what will transpire between Celtic and Dundee United will be random and instinctive, Gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what\u2019s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top. \u2018Every game,\u2019 he replied when asked how frequently he\u2019d dip into video analysis. \u2018Free kicks, penalties, the way strikers like to finish the ball, how they strike the ball. \u2018I just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what\u2019s their favourite side. Notes are taken on different players so I know. All of that stuff. Gordon  fails to hold the ball allowing Rodrigo Palacio of Inter Milan to score in the Europa League. \u2018It\u2019s about taking that research out on the training pitch, too, and practicing for who you\u2019re going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low, early crosses into the box, for example. \u2018For the Rangers game, it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that. That played out during the game too as I was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off. Between all of us we come up with a plan for the game.\u2019 And when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet? Gordon will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since\u00a0Hearts earned cup glory in 2006. \u2018Absolutely, it\u2019s satisfying,\u2019 Gordon added. \u2018It becomes a team effort with Woodsy (Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach) and the video analysis guys to ensure we\u2019re as well prepared as possible. And that\u2019s not just me - John Collins does it with midfielders and defenders, so it\u2019s preparation. \u2018What we\u2019re trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we\u2019re coming up against.\u2019 Celtic have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach. Nine years ago, Gordon played in the Scottish Cup Final for Hearts against Gretna \u2013 his last major final as it would transpire. Few neutral observers fancied the Borderers to go the distance that day but they did just that. Gordon\u2019s intervention in the final chapter was key, however. As Hearts hit four perfect kicks, he saved from Derek Townsley before watching Gavin Skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top. Celtic goalkeeper Gordon celebrates their goal during the Scottish Premiership match against Aberdeen. \u2018I had a fair idea of most of the Gretna penalty takers,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018I had seen penalties from them. Most were from memory. With penalties, nowadays everyone does their homework.\u2019 That stop from 12 yards not only allowed Gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers Scotland has produced. When a \u00a39million move to Sunderland was completed a year later, it seemed he\u2019d spend half his life on the winner\u2019s podium. Little did he realise at the time, how unique those scenes of celebration would prove. A year ago, with the road back from injury seemingly never ending, the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful. \u2018I probably didn\u2019t appreciate at the time like I should have done - playing in a cup final, winning a cup,\u2019 he reflected. Celtic keeper Gordon speaks with referee Craig Thomson after the Scottish Cup quarter final. \u2018Albeit it\u2019s a different competition this Sunday but it\u2019s still to win a cup, I probably did think it would come around again, that I\u2019d get another chance. \u2018I haven\u2019t been close until now so I\u2019m going to enjoy this one a little bit more, but then I\u2019ll only really enjoy it if we win the match. \u2018It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll look back on fondly if we don\u2019t. Certainly I want to take it in a little more this time.\u2019 Gordon is beaten by Rangers striker Nacho Novo during Hearts' 3"}

Carafem, which opens this week, has a no-frills attitude when it comes to informing people with what they provide. One of their advertisement's reads, 'Abortion: Yeah, we do that'. Christopher Purdy, the clinic's president and founder, said he was inspired to start Carafem after working more than a decade promoting family planning and HIV prevention in developing countries. Carafem president and founder Christopher Purdy (pictured with health services vice president Melissa S. Grant) has begun a new Washington, D.C. abortion clinic that presents itself with a'spa-like feel' It was there he realized how much easier it was to get an abortion, sometimes as simple as walking into a pharmacy, in places such as Ethiopia. Meanwhile, in the United States more than 200 laws have restricted the controversial procedure and forced dozens of clinics to close their doors, according to the Washington Post. Melissa S. Grant, Carafem's health services vice president, said  it was important for the clinic 'to try and present an upgrade, almost spa-like feel'. The clinic will also only provide pharmaceutical abortions, meaning there will be no vacuum aspiration or surgical procedures available - this means that Carafem's clients cannot be more than 10 weeks pregnant. Purdy told the Washington Post that not purchasing surgical equipment allows him to charge $400 for the procedure, which is about $100 less than the average pharmaceutical abortion. The clinic offers fluffy robes, natural wood floors and tea on arrival, in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure. Clients who walk into Carafem will receive counseling and go through 'basic tests' before they take the initial pill at the clinic. The whole appointment is supposed to take about 60 minutes. The second set of pills, which induces the abortion, is then taken at home the next day. On it's website, Carafem says it's staff provides 'clear, non-judgmental and accurate information so you feel confident'. 'We are an experienced team with years of experience in abortion care,' it states. Purdy said the clinic plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word.' Anti-abortion activists don't believe Carafem's bold take is going to work. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion lobbying group the Susan B. Anthony List, believes the approach is too celebratory. She said she believes even people who are pro-choice think of the procedure as 'a necessary evil'. National Right to Life President Carol Tobias believes people will find Carafem disgusting. 'Abortion is not pleasant, and trying to put pretty wrappings around the procedure isn't going to make any difference,' she said. Purdy said the clinic, which he described as 'fresh, modern, clean and caring', plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically. 'We don't walk to talk in hushed tones,' he said. 'We use the A-word' Carafem's founders aren't the only people speaking publicly and positively about abortion. A number of female Democratic lawmakers have shared their personal experiences to put a human face on the procedure and protest anti-abortion legislation. Last week Ohio Democrat Rep. Teresa Fedor revealed during a debate in the House that she had terminated a pregnancy after being raped while serving in the military and became pregnant. 'You don't respect my reason, my rape, my abortion,' she said as representatives debated the state's Heartbeat Bill, which would make it a felony for doctors to provide abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected. 'I guarantee you there are other woman who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak that voice,' she continued. 'I've sat here long enough.'"}

For one mother though, the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother. In 2008, Franky Regan Lamb faced the news that her 21-year-old son Rakeim Regan had fatally stabbed her mother, Pat Regan,  in her own home, in Leeds. Scroll down for video. In a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, Franky Regan Lamb has spoken out about the horrifying incident in 2008 when her son, Rakeim Regan, murdered her mother Pat. Now in a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, which aired yesterday on the CI channel, Franky, her brother Shane and their friends have spoken out about the horrific incident which will haunt the family forever. Rakeim, who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture, killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis. His mental state seriously deteriorated after his Uncle Danny - Pat's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene. Rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that Danny, a notorious drug dealer, might be a bad influence on him. Danny, who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm, was shot to death in 2002, following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs. Following her son's death Pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and, according to Franky, had a close relationship with Rakeim. Murdered Pat Regan (right) was an anti-gun campaigner, pictured here with fellow campaigner Michelle Forbes outside  Downing Street in 2008. Slain uncle: Pat's son Danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs. She said: 'If he was in trouble, he'd go to my mum\u00a0probably\u00a0more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better. He was her grandson - they were just really close.' Despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about Rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence. His uncle Shane admitted: 'We had worries about him, because it seemed that he was impressed with, kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff. 'You know, there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just, kind of like, saying, \"You don't need to be focused on that kind of stuff. You need to focus more on your education, your music\" - you know, things that are quite playful, things that are positive. 'Don't look at the negative and don't be, you know, tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle.' Sadly, there was nothing the family could do to help him and as Rakeim started to dabble more and more in drugs, his paranoia started to increase.

The changes include the establishment of a new 'Directorate of Digital Innovation' and the blending of analysts and operators into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world. The changes are intended to address intelligence gaps and keep up with the technological 'pace of change.'", "article": "CIA Director John Brennan has ordered a sweeping overhaul of the spy agency, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into traditional intelligence gathering. Brennan announced the restructuring to the CIA workforce Friday. He said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency's management structure, including what deputy CIA director David Cohen called 'pain points,' organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently. Briefing reporters with Cohen at CIA headquarters this week, Brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering. He lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world. Not your grandparents' CIA: The CIA\u00a0is launching one of the biggest reorganizations in its history, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into intelligence gathering. Critical look: CIA Director John Brennan\u00a0said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the CIA is not covering. 'There are a lot of areas that I would like to have better insight to, better information about, better access to,' Brennan said. 'Safe havens, denied areas.  Whether because we don't even have a diplomatic presence in a country, or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others.' On the cyber front, the CIA chief said he is establishing a new 'Directorate of Digital Innovation' to lead the agency's efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology. US officials said that Brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive. Historically, electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the US government. But the CIA felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological 'pace of change,' as one official put it. Brennan said the new digital directorate will have equal status within the agency with four other directorates which have existed for years. 'Our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging' in today's digital world, Brennan said. 'And so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we\u2019re able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment.' Pitfall: Evidence shows that the CIA may have taken too long to find and kill Osama bin Laden - a mission that was accomplished in 2011 after a decade-long manhunt. Brennan avoided the term 'cyber,' a word used by the National Security Agency, the country's premier digital spying service. The changes come against a backdrop of widespread concern that the CIA's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the September 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the Cold War. The CIA, along with other US intelligence agencies, wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of Middle East governments during the Arab Spring in 2011, among other shortcomings. The agency's greatest public success of recent years \u2014 the 10-year effort to locate and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011 \u2014 may have taken longer than it should have, according to evidence made public in the recent Senate report on CIA interrogations.  Internal CIA surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency. In the most significant departure, the CIA would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms, a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses, in different offices, than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers. The new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world. There are a handful of such centers at the moment, including the Counter Terrorism Center, where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-Qaida with espionage and drone strikes. Under the new plan, each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction, including covert operations, spying, analysis, liaison with foreign partners and logistics. The system of CIA stations, headed by a CIA station chief, will remain in place, Brennan said. Most stations are in US embassies, and various CIA case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers. The changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the CIA's current budget, CIA officials said. Critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts, who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake. It may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally, the theory goes. Blended:\u00a0The new overhaul plan would bring CIA operatives and data analysts together in 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world"}

Jurors also got a chance to see jihadist files. recovered from his laptop. The bomb, described as similar to the twin bombs set off at. the race, was extracted from a Honda Civic in which it embedded. itself on a Watertown, Massachusetts street after Dzhokhar. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, detonated it during. the gunfight. The pressure cooker was the same type as was used in the. bombs that killed three people and injured 264 on April 15,. 2013, said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Brian. Corcoran, though the pieces found in Watertown were more intact. than those discovered at the race's finish line. The Boston bombing jury was shown images of a pressure cooker bomb that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly threw at police during a shootout in the neighborhood on Watertown. The pressure cooker bomb in Watertown was lodged into a Honda and was more intact than the two found at the Boston Marathon finish line. The lid of the device landed two houses away, in a local child's hockey goal. Pieces of the bomb shrapnel were found on nearby roofs, lawns, and lodged in the siding of homes up to a block away. A piece of shrapnel metal seen above with BBs stuck to it on the street where the Tsarnaev's threw pipe bombs and a pressure-cooker bomb, on the left. On the right, a remnant of the bottom of the Watertown pressure-cooker bomb. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston. 'Those pieces were typically more fragmented, more cut up,' Corcoran testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, looking at. both the main pot and its lid, which was found halfway down the. block from the blast site, in a child-sized soccer goal in a. home's side yard. 'This was a better representation of the. pressure cooker as a whole.' Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is. convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and. shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he. and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston. The Watertown gunfight in the early hours of April 19, 2013. ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hopped into a black Mercedes and. attempted to run over three police officers who were trying to. arrest Tamerlan. The officers jumped out of the way but Dzhokhar. ran over his brother, who was briefly caught up in the vehicle's. wheels and dragged. Tsarnaev's lawyers opened the trial early this month by. bluntly admitting he carried out the bombing and shooting. Their. goal is to convince the jury that the plot was driven by. Tamerlan, with Dzhokhar a junior partner in the scheme. Proving. that could persuade the jury to sentence the younger brother to. life in prison without possibility of parole, rather than death. Tsarnaev (left) pictured in court on Thursday as an expert testifies about the jihadi propaganda found on his laptop. Tsarnaev casually leans on his hand during his death penalty trial on Thursday, March 19. The jury was also shown images of a Samsung laptop, which was found in Watertown along with Tamerlan's high school diploma. Several jihadist materials were found on Dzhokhar's laptop and orange flash drive, including an article on how to make homemade bombs. Another FBI agent testified that investigators recovered. several apparently jihadist documents on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's. laptop, including at least three copies of Al Qaeda's 'Inspire' magazine, one featuring a cover story headlined 'Make a Bomb in. the Kitchen of Your Mom,' and another brochure-type document. titled 'Jihad and the Effects of Intention Upon It.' The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29,. graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard. Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean.

He was praised by world leaders for his effective leadership and transforming Singapore into a thriving international business hub. A state funeral will be held in his honor on Sunday.", "article": "(CNN)Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore, died early Monday morning, according to a statement released by the office of Singapore's current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. He was 91. Lee passed away peacefully at Singapore General Hospital at 3:18 a.m., the statement said. He had been in the hospital with pneumonia since February 5. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. \"The first of our founding fathers is no more,\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee's son,  told the nation in a televised speech Monday. \"He fought for our independence, built a nation where there was none and made us proud to be Singaporeans,\" Lee said. Building up Singapore was his passion, the Prime Minister said, reading out a quote from his father:  \"At the end of the day what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.\" Lee's body will lie in state at Parliament House from Wednesday through Saturday.  A state funeral will be held Sunday. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a condolence statement and said Lee \"helped Singapore to transition from a developing country to one of the most developed in the world, transforming it into a thriving international business hub.\" President Obama called Lee a visionary who helped him formulate U.S. policy of \"rebalancing to the Asia Pacific,\" when the two met in Singapore in 2009. \"He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs,\" the President said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also praised the advice he got from Lee, calling it \"the most valuable and insightful I have received.\" \"He was, of course, a uniquely astute analyst and observer of Asia, and it is largely through his life's work that Singapore became one of the United States' strongest strategic partners in the region,\" Kerry said. Former President George H. W. Bush said he respected Lee's effective leadership of a \"wonderful, resilient and innovative country in ways that lifted living standards without indulging a culture of corruption.\" He added, \" Because of the example set by Lee Kuan Yew's singular leadership, I am confident that the future will be bright for Singapore.\" China's foreign ministry called Lee \"a uniquely influential Asian statesman,\" and Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said \"our region owes much to Lee Kuan Yew.\" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indonesia's foreign ministry also praised Lee's leadership in their condolence notices. Singapore's President Tony Tan Keng Yam called Lee the \"architect of our modern Republic,\" in a letter to Lee's son, the current prime minister. \"Few have demonstrated such complete commitment to a cause greater than themselves,\" President Tan said."}

A Parish councillor  has won a \u00a3400 payout from Thomas Cook after booking what he thought was a'relaxing holiday' to a Greek party island where he was housed with 'boozed up' youngsters at a Club 18-30 hotel. John Moore, 56, from Herne in Kent, planned to spend a week on the island of Zante with his partner Angela, 51, in September. Rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for, the couple, who run a sweet shop in Herne Bay, Kent, \u00a0were booked into Christina Studios in the resort of Laganas in Zante, advertised as an 18-30 clubbing destination. After spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were 'banging on the walls and screaming and shouting', the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet. They have since been awarded \u00a3400 in compensation by the holiday company. While being advertised by Club 18-30, Christina Studios is described on the Thomas Cook website as 'one of the best chill-out zones' in Zante. Upon their arrival however Mr Moore found 'boozed up' youngsters who 'didn't seem to sleep'. 'When we got there I asked the rep if he really thought I would book an 18-30 holiday,' the Parish councillor said. 'When I go on holiday I don't care really where it is, I want to just have a good time but it wasn't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people. 'It was an official 18-30 resort. It was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting, so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking.' After complaining to the Thomas Cook rep at the resort, the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the \u00a3600 they had already spent. They would also have no other choice but to go to another Club 18-30, said Mr Moore. 'We were just speechless really, it wasn't what we wanted or what we were expecting and Angela was horrified.' While the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with 'rowdy' youngsters, they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel's treatment towards them. 'The apartments didn't have hot water but when I complained the owner used very, very rude language.' At that Mr Moore and his partner packed their things immediately and, they say, waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation. Eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the UK. Mr Moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act, and was recently offered \u00a3400 after requesting a summons from a judge. The hotel where Mr Moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the Laganas strip (above), hailed as one of Zante's biggest nightlife spots. The 56-year-old Parish councillor said Christina Studios (above) where he was placed was 'packed with youngsters' who'screamed and banged on walls' 'I'm not surprised at all (that they've offered me money), they didn't have a leg to stand on,' he said, speaking of the offer. 'They sent us to an 18-30s hotel having seen how old we looked.' Among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns: 'Don't bother if you are over thirty as it's too noisy.' The apartments are a five minute walk from the Laganas strip, described by Thomas Cook as Zante's 'party resort' whose nightlife is 'in the same league as Ibiza'. But Mr Moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday, with the resort also described as suitable for family trips. Among TripAdvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as 'filthy' and 'noisy'. One positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the 'ultimate' place for a boys or girls' holiday. Thomas Cook apologised for the couple's experience in September. 'We would like to apologise to Mr Moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Christina Studios in Zante with our Escapades brand in September 2014,' a spokesman said. 'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction.' The accommodation is advertised as being provided by Club 18-30 on the Thomas Cook website (above)"}

Can is aware of the rivalry between the two sides, and is confident that Liverpool's young team can improve and have good years ahead.", "article": "Emre Can was bemused. Brendan Rodgers had been at his most effusive, purring about the German's ability, but his words were unwittingly lost in translation. Eager to promote the giant strides Can had made, Rodgers delved into his lexicon and likened Liverpool's new No 23 to a Rolls-Royce, following a series of effortlessly smooth performances. When his manager's words were relayed, however, there was nothing more than a quizzical look. 'We wouldn't use that expression in Germany, we wouldn't say something like that,' says Can, taking up the story. 'I know a Rolls Royce is a big, luxurious car so I associated it with a positive comment, but I didn't know exactly what it meant. I hadn't heard the comparison before. Liverpool's Emre Can (left) was among an influx of new players brought to Anfield last summer. Can, pictured heading the ball during Liverpool's training session on Friday, has found form in 2015. Can (right) runs with Steven Gerrard during  training ahead of Liverpool's match with Manchester United. 'Then again, I had a feeling it couldn't be so bad if the manager was saying something like that.' This is the first time Can has faced the English media since his \u00a310million arrival from Bayer Leverkusen and he smiles as he relays the anecdote. Initially, Can is withdrawn and lacking confidence but eventually, with the help of an interpreter, he emerges from his shell. In some ways, this interview is a microcosm of how his Liverpool career has been to date. As part of the huge influx of new players last summer, Can failed to make an instant impact and in the early months of the campaign, he did nothing but float on the periphery. Since Christmas, though, the landscape has changed dramatically, both for him and Liverpool. Playing on the right side of a three-man defence, Can has not looked back since his introduction as a half-time substitute at Burnley on Boxing Day. 'I was injured at the beginning of the season and then played against Chelsea (in November),' says Can, referring to a 2-1 defeat in which he scored Liverpool's goal. 'Then I was out of the team until December when I came on (at half-time) against Burnley. Can has faced the English media for the first time since his \u00a310million move from Bayer Leverkusen. Can pictured tackling Wayne Routledge during Liverpool's 1-0 win over Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Can has drawn midfield comparisons with Germans Michael Ballack (left) and Bastian Schweinsteiger (right) 'My attitude was not to moan or make a big fuss about it but to keep calm and work hard so that when I got the chance against Burnley I could break into the side. I feel very good feel I have the trust of the manager. I believe I'm doing a good job and that is why I am playing. I'm happy.' Powerful and imposing, Can has a defender's physique but his qualities as a midfielder have drawn comparisons with Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Given how he has been performing, it seems remarkable Bayern Munich allowed him to move on. Bayern had an option to buy back their Academy graduate from Leverkusen but were content to let Liverpool have him. There are certainly no arguments about that decision at Anfield. Rodgers, for one, believes Can has the ability to 'play for any side in the world'. Can, clearly, is going to be an important figure and an idea of how much the 21-year-old has backed himself to succeed is by the fact he asked to take over the 23 jersey that had been vacant since Jamie Carragher departed in May 2013. Can has looked a different player since Christmas as he continues to thrive under Liverpool boss Rodgers. Can will be among those hoping Liverpool can get revenge over Manchester United on Sunday at Anfield. 'I did want the 23 because there was a high importance here, and I knew about it before I came,' he says. 'It is a big honour to wear it after Carragher retired but I don't feel any extra pressure because of it.' So on to Sunday and the battle with Manchester United. Had things worked out differently, he could have been lining up against Liverpool, as the David Moyes regime scouted Can twice last season but, instead, he will be aiming to derail their top four ambitions. 'I am well aware United will be a tough game and I know about the rivalry,' says Can. 'We have a very young team and need to keep improving. But if we do, there will be good years. I am playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. I have no regrets about coming here.'"}

'Fair's fair - you wouldn't do this at your mum and dad's place, don't do it at our lake.' Scroll down for video. 'We know you've have come here for a good time, and not a long time... but you obviously don't give a toss!' says Tim, who volunteered to clean-up after the festival. 'Disgusting it's left up to the local community that was kind enough to let us on their beautiful land,' wrote one festival-goer on social media. The video, posted to You Tube by the Maitreya festival organisers, pans an area of bushland littered with old couches and trashed tents, water bottles, discarded costumes, hoola hoops and beer cartons. 'If they're organised enough to bring couches, surely they can be organised enough to take them home, it's just simple courtesy,' says Tim as he loads a truck with garbage bags and old cushions. 'Fair's fair - you wouldn't do this at your mum and dad's place, don't do it at our lake,' says Tim, one of the volunteers with the Charlton Football club. The Maitreya event prides itself on being environmentally conscious and before the party, urged festival goers, as 'friends of the eartth,' to leave no trace. 'If we can become responsible caretakers of the land, as is our heritage, we can continue to gather here for many moons to come\u2026.If we can't... sadly with the indictment on our shoulders we will have to leave\u2026,' stated the festival website. The Maitreya festival was held here on the Wooroonooka Lakes, near Charlton in country Victoria. The picturesque camp site before the Maitreya music festival last weekend. The beautiful Wooroonooka Lake is a popular camping spot for nature lovers and recreational fishers. According to the Charlton Football Club, it took four solid days and a team of fifty plus volunteers to get the site back to how it was. A bush doof is an outdoor dance party, usually held in a remote area, or in bush or rainforests outside big cities in Australia or New Zealand. 'Doof doof' is an Australian term for loud, heavy bass electronic music. In most cases, bush doofs are small and secret, promoted by word-of-mouth or social media. Sometimes they last for days. Last year, a central coast teenager survived an 80-metre cliff fall after trying to avoid the cover charge for a 'bush doof' in the Watagan State Forest, north of Sydney. Another 21-year-old man went missing for more than 48 hours in forest south-east of Perth after attending a remote rave. Bush doofs usually involve live techno or trance DJs and are notorious for illicit drug use. 'People were disappointed by the rubbish, but I was out there yesterday and I'd say 90 per cent of the camp ground was restored to it's natural state,' Charlton Football Club secretary, Martin\u00a0McGeown, told Daily Mail Australia. Some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options in comments to social media. 'Unlike Rainbow and others where you are provided with a garbage bag at the gate they did not even mention to us anything about rubbish disposal,' wrote one You Tube user who attended the festival. 'We were never told that there were any bins on site and did not even see one until we drove out the gate on the last day. Perhaps if they want people to be more responsible they need to take responsibility for informing festival patrons about how to properly dispose of their rubbish and provide adequate bins!' But Maitreya organisers have scolded festival goers on their official Facebook page, posting 'Maitreya festival patrons got a lot to learn! Take some RESPONSIBILTY! 'Take some RESPONSIBILTY:' Festival organisers say Maitreya patrons have a lot to learn. 'You obviously don't give a toss': Volunteers were frustrated at cleaning up the mess. Taking out the trash: It took volunteers more than four days to clean up the campsite. McGeown says the Charlton club provided bins and a rubbish crew for the event and its members were out"}

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted to reporters on Monday that Petraeus, the architect of President George W. Bush's Iraq'surge' operation, is still on speed dial despite reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors. 'He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq,\" Earnest said during a press briefing. 'So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. TOO IMPORTANT TO FAIL? Josh Earnest told journalists on Monday that administration officials were still consulting with disgraced former CIA chief David Petraeus about fighting the ISIS terror army in Iraq. AFFAIR: Petraeus will plead guilty to a\u00a0charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified information after he handed over sensitive material to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, right. Earnest defended the decision by noting that Petraeus \u2013 who no longer has a CIA security clearance, according to Newsweek \u2013 nonetheless has kept up his strong relationships with military and political leaders in Iraq. 'Obviously, General Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq,' the president's chief spokesman said. 'He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country. Over that time, he developed strong relationships with some of his Iraqi counterparts and with some of Iraq's political leaders.' Iraq is one of the two countries \u2013 Syria is the other \u2013 where ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, has managed to run roughshod over government armies and claim territory since the Obama administration pulled American troops out at the end of 2011. A retired four-star general, Petraeus' storied career suffered a major blow from revelations he gave the biographer, Paula Broadwell, eight binders of classified material he had kept improperly. Documents filed in federal court state that between August 2011 and April 5, 2013, Petraeus did 'unlawfully and knowingly' take classified materials and retain them at 'unauthorized' locations. In one August 2011 taped biographical interview with Broadwell that prosecutors used against Petraeus, he can be heard saying of papers in front of them both: 'They're really \u2013 I mean they are highly classified, some of them. They don\u2019t have [\"top secret\"] on it, but, I mean there\u2019s \"code word\" stuff in there.' Prosecutors say he gave her classified binders, called 'black books,' which included notes about his discussions with President Obama. He left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography, prosecutors said. Days later, Petraeus brought the books back to his home in Arlington, Virginia. The FBI later seized the materials in a search of Petraeus' home. He later lied to FBI agents about providing them to Broadwell and said he never gave her classified material, according to court documents. In late August 2011, he took the books to the home where Broadwell was staying during a week-long trip to Washington, D.C., according to the documents. The 62-year-old agreed on February 22 to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count that carries a possible sentence of up to a year in prison. But he is expected to get two years of probation and a $40,000 fine. The plea agreement was filed in federal court on March 3. Petraeus is expected to be in federal court next on April 27 for a hearing on the deal. Earnest was asked if any special security precautions were being taken because of Petraeus' legal situation. 'Not that I'm aware of,' he replied. The federal judge who will sentence Petraeus later this year is not bound by federal prosecutors' recommendations and could make a decision to send Petraeus to prison. By reaching a deal with the government, Petraeus will avoid an embarrassing trial that would detail his relationship with Paula Broadwell. He stepped down as head of the CIA after their affair emerged in November 2012. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012. Scandal: The affair was revealed after Florida socialite Jill Kelley, pictured, contacted the FBI over threatening emails she had received. It emerged that Broadwell had sent the emails. Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and"}

His lawyers are arguing that he is mentally impaired and unable to understand his death sentence due to a traumatic brain injury he suffered in 1972. Clayton's family and lawyers are calling for a competency hearing to determine whether he is mentally competent to be executed.", "article": "A man who murdered a sheriff's deputy years after doctors removed part of his brain will be put to death in Missouri next week - but his lawyers are fighting for him to be saved. Cecil Clayton, from Purdy, will be executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre at 6pm on March 17 for the November 1996 shooting of\u00a0Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter. But his attorneys are making a last-ditch attempt to save him by calling for a competency trial - saying a traumatic brain injury makes it impossible for him to understand his death sentence. In 1972, 24 years before he killed the officer, Clayton was using a sawmill when a board splintered and a shard went into his head above his right eye, the\u00a0St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Facing death: Cecil Clayton is scheduled to die in Missouri next week but his lawyers are calling for a competency hearing. Twenty years before he murdered a cop, he had part of his brain removed, they say. Doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe, the area of the brain that controls decision making and emotions, the newspaper reported as it called for Clayton to be spared. Following the accident and before the arrest, Clayton frequently went to mental health facilities, spending up to 15 months at a time under psychiatric care. Then the evening before Thanksgiving in 1996, Deputy Castetter responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle parked outside Clayton's girlfriend's mother's home. Earlier that night, Clayton and his girlfriend had been arguing, and prosecutors said he then took a loaded gun to her mother's house. Clayton walked up to the deputy's patrol car window and shot him in the head at point-blank range. Castetter, a 29-year-old married father-of-three, died in the hospital later that day. He was convicted of the murder in October 1997 and sentenced to death later that year. His attorneys argued that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial but despite their appeals, state and federal appeals courts have upheld the conviction and the death penalty. His lawyers are now seeking a competency hearing to determine whether he understands his death penalty. Mental health professionals who have examined him agree that he is mentally impaired and has mental health issues, including dementia. Killed:\u00a0Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter, pictured left, was shot dead by Clayton, pictured right in an old mug shot, as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996. His most recent IQ test found he had an IQ of just 71 - 29 points below the average. 'He is not simply incompetent legally; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic self-care, were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him,' according to a doctor who examined him, the Kansas City Star reported. 'He can shower, groom, eat, walk; it is his comprehension, judgment, memory, limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him.' But there is no agreement on how much he understands his death penalty or his other options. 'If you can prove mental retardation, you can get exempted, but mental illness alone is not an exemption to the death penalty,' Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the New York Times. In Missouri, the director of the Department of Corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing, and last year, he called on a doctor to examine Clayton. Dr. James Reynolds of the Missouri Department of Mental Health concluded that Clayton is mentally ill, but could not be certain that he doesn't understand his death sentence. Execution: He is scheduled to be put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre, pictured, next Tuesday. Death: His family and lawyers are arguing that he is child-like and does not understand the significance of his death penalty. They are calling for his execution at Bonne Terre (pictured) to be stopped. But Clayton's lawyers say, while he may have conversations in which he understands he is about to be executed, he will later forget that conversation ever happened. His family have also called for a fair hearing on the issue. 'He is brain-damaged, and talking with him is like talking to a child,' Clayton's daughter, Jena Clayton, said during his clemency petition, the Kansas City Star reported. 'I do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled.' Clayton, who is the state's oldest death row inmate, will be put to death between 6pm on March 17 and 5.59pm on March 18. He will become the second person put to death in the state in 2015, after a record 10 executions in Missouri in 2014. Last month, Walter Storey was put to death for slitting his neighbor's throat 25 years ago."}

The 28-year-old prompted the storm after writing a quiz in the March 30 edition of New Yorker magazine - asking readers if a number of statements referred to her dog or boyfriend Jack Antonoff. They included: 'He doesn\u2019t tip', 'he never brings his wallet anywhere' and 'he has hair all over his body, like most males who share his background'. Ms Dunham, whose own mother is Jewish, has been criticised by Twitter users, as well as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - an organisation which fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. Dog or Jewish boyfriend? 'Girls' star Lena Dunham, pictured here with her boyfriend Jack Antonoff, has been criticised for an article some claim is anti-Semitic. Quiz: Lena Dunham asked: 'Do the following statements refer to (a) my dog or (b) my Jewish boyfriend?' She is pictured with her dog Lamby. Row: Ms Dunham, whose own mother is Jewish, has been criticised by Twitter users, as well as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - an organisation which fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. Also among the 35 statements were'my grandma Dottie loves him and says he\u2019s a \u201cgood, good boy\"' and 'bald men trigger a primal fear in him'. Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, said: 'Some will certainly find Lena Dunham\u2019s stereotypes about cheap Jews offensive. Others will take issue with the very idea of comparing a dog and a Jewish boyfriend. 'While we understand that humor is its own special brand of expression and always try to give leeway to comedians, we wish that she had chosen another, less insensitive way to publicly reflect on her boyfriend\u2019s virtues and vices. 'We are surprised that the New Yorker chose to print it.' Twitter users were quick to criticise the piece, while others used it as an opportunity to troll the star. One user wrote: 'I am so glad @ADL_National finally has taken on the task of charging people for their Jewish humor. Mazel tov!' Earlier today, one wrote: 'Whoa...yikes. Besides it being offensive, it isn't even close to funny, let alone original. I get being edgy...but lame.' Choice: Also among the 35 statements were'my grandma Dottie loves him and says he\u2019s a \u201cgood, good boy\"' and 'bald men trigger a primal fear in him. Other Twitter users jumped to her defence. One said: 'Isn't Lena Dunham Jewish? What's the big deal?' The New Yorker editor-in-chief David Remnick also baked the publication's use of the piece in a statement released on Saturday and condemned those who had whipped up the storm on social media. It read: 'The Jewish-comic tradition is rich with the mockery of, and playing with, stereotypes. 'Anyone who has ever heard Lenny Bruce or Larry David or Sarah Silverman or who has read \u2018Portnoy\u2019s Complaint\u2019 knows that. Lena Dunham, who is Jewish and hugely talented, is a comic voice working in that vein. 'Richard Pryor and Chris Rock do the same about black stereotypes; Amy Schumer does it with women and gender. I don\u2019t mind if one reader or another didn\u2019t find the piece funny. People can differ on that. 'But considering all the real hatred and tragedy in the world, the people getting exercised about the so-called anti-Semitism of this comic piece, like those who railed at Philip Roth a generation or two ago, are, with respect, howling in the wrong direction.' Ms Dunham lives with her boyfriend, Fun guitarist Jack Antonoff, who she met on a blind date organised by mutual friends. It is the latest in a series of controversies involving the star. The quiz in The New Yorker's March 30 edition included statements like 'he doesn\u2019t tip', 'he never brings his wallet anywhere' and 'he has hair all over his body, like most males who share his background' In January she was forced to apologize after suggesting the storm over Bill Cosby's rape allegations is as significant as the slaughter of millions of Jews while speaking to the New York Times. Referring to Judd Apatow's 'obsession' with the revelations, she said: 'It\u2019s sort of like saying someone\u2019s obsessed with the Holocaust. 'This is a huge issue, and it speaks to the way that we abuse power and the way that celebrity allows for injustice.' In December she claimed she was raped by an acquaintance in college, detailed in a passage from her new book Not That Kind of Girl.

After the blasts, Tsarnaev was seen on surveillance footage buying a half-gallon of milk at a Whole Foods store in Cambridge, Massachusetts.", "article": "New surveillance footage of a Boston bomber laying an explosive then fleeing the scene has been shown in court. Footage shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking through the city before pausing near the finish line, where he dropped an explosive charge that killed an eight-year-old boy. He is seen standing in the crowd for several minutes, before calling his brother, Tamerlan. Shortly after the call, the first bomb explodes - at which point he pushes his way through the stunned crowd. Tsarnaev managed to clear the blast zone in the 12 seconds between the first bomb exploding and his going off - but is still in the shot from a surveillance camera at the scene. Shock: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, cirlced top left, is pictured above in FBI surveillance video standing in a crowd the moment the first bomb goes off at the Boston marathon. While most of the crowd looks towards the blast, he heads off in the other direction. Explosion: Pictured above is the moment Tsarnaev's pressure cooker bomb exploded. It killed two people and wounded dozens more. Killer: The blast ended the life of 8-year-old Martin Richard, and also robbed his sister of one of her legs. Some 12 seconds later, a second explosion takes place precisely where he was standing. He is later shown running from the scene without the backpack he was carrying earlier. It is unclear exactly how the bomb was detonated - though early claims that it primitive kitchen-timer device seem to be endorsed by the fact that Tsarnaev was still fleeing when the bomb went off. The blast killed eight-year-old Martin Richard, as well as Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old student. Martin's younger sister, Jane, lost a leg in the blast and hundreds were injured. The footage was shown to jurors weighing up whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death for the bombing - which his lawyers do not deny he did. The video - nine and a half minutes in total - was compiled by FBI investigators from surveillance footage around the city.

It shows both brothers walking the streets before splitting up to set down the pressure cooker bombs near the finish line on April 15, 2013. He is the only surviving bomber, as Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gun battle days after the attacks. Defense attorneys have argued that Tamerlan persuaded his brother to carry out the attacks, and as such he is not as culpable. Seconds later, the second bomb explodes, and Tsarnaev, who prosecutors say detonated the second bomb, is seen running with a crowd of people who also are running, pushing some out of his way to flee the scene. People are also shown jumping over metal barriers as smoke wafts over the scene. In wait: Tsarnaev is pictured above just down the street from the site of the bomb blast. Approaching: Tsarnaev, circled in white, is seen here walking up to the spot where he dropped the explosive. Less than 30 minutes later, Tsarnaev calmly walked into a Whole Foods store in Cambridge and bought a half-gallon of milk. Jurors were shown surveillance video of him making the purchase and then returning to the passenger side of a car parked in the lot. He then strangely runs back into the store to exchange the gallon of milk for another and then returns to the car. Tsarnaev's defense attorneys cross-examined a witness who said the time stamps on the Whole Foods CCTV was approximate, but prosecutors countered that with a receipt of Tsarnaev's purchase confirming the time for that day was correct. Prosecutors also showed jurors tweets from what they identified as two accounts of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 'If you have the knowledge and the inspiration all that's left is to take action,' he tweeted April 7, a little over a week before the bombings. 'I want the highest levels of Jannah,' he tweeted March 10, referring to the Islamic concept of paradise. 'I want to be able to see allah every single day for that is the best of pleasures.' After the blasts: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen entering a Whole Foods in Cambridge, Massachusetts just 30 minutes after the explosions. Errand: Surveillance footage from the Whole Foods shows the younger Tsarneav buying a carton of milk and then checking out. Not the driver: After leaving the store, Dzhokhar is seen walking in the parking lot and entering a waiting car through the passenger-side door. Wrong milk: Dzhokhar was seen re-entering the store to exchange the bottle of milk he purchased for another. Timing: Tsarnaev's lawyers cross-examined a witness who said the time stamps on the surveillance video were approximate, but Whole Foods provided a receipt for Tsarnaev that proves they were correct on that day.

Men and boys were targeted by gunmen after they stormed Njaba in eastern Nigeria before burning the remote village to the ground. The assault took place early on Tuesday as many villagers in the isolated community were heading to morning prayers. 'The attack was not immediately known because the village is very remote and our men couldn't access the area,' said a military source. Nigerian troops have been struggling to control Boko Haram. Pictured: Chardian soldiers near the front line in Gambaru, Nigeria. One woman, Falmata Bisika, 62, lost four of her grandchildren in the raid, which she said was carried out by gunmen 'armed to the teeth' with weapons and explosives. The militants destroyed homes and businesses with petrol bombs and shot anyone attempting to flee, 'especially teenagers and the elderly', she said. Muminu Haruna, 42, said he hid in a grain silo behind his house for several hours with about eight other people until the gunmen left. 'I participated in the counting of dead bodies... 68 people were killed,' he said in an account supported by two civilian vigilantes. 'These included both males and females, some were slaughtered and others shot dead and most of the houses in our village have been destroyed.' Njaba is 20 kilometres from the town of Damboa, which was seized by Boko Haram last June, forcing thousands to flee, but later recaptured by troops helped by civilian vigilantes. Boko Haram's six-year insurgency to carve out an Islamic state in the northeast of Nigeria has killed thousands and displaced over 1.5 million people. The group gained worldwide notoriety in April 2014 after its members kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls from the town of Chibokin Borno state, the heartland of Boko Haram. The slow government response sparked the movement Bring BackOur Girls that has been seeking international support and lobbying the government to keep up the search. Today, a representative for President Goodluck met the girls' families in Maiduguri. Boko Haram control a large area of Borno state and have also carried out cross-border raids in Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. A military coalition has recaptured several towns in recent weeks. Chadian soldiers patrol in the border town of Gamboru, Nigeria, after taking control of the city, February 4, 2015. A screen grab made on January 20, 2015 from a video of Nigerian Islamist extremist group Boko Haram shows Abubakar Shekau, the group's leader, delivering a message at an unknown location. Chad's well-trained army has offered a huge boost to Nigeria in recent weeks, recapturing towns in border areas and pushing into territory near Boko Haram's Sambisa Forest training camps. Chadian President Idriss Deby yesterday claimed he knew where Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau was and called on him to surrender or be killed. The Nigerian authorities have declared Shekau dead three times but the military has since reportedly said that they want the militant leader captured alive."}

The launch of Netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the Australian TV landscape in decades. But the online streaming services will still have to convince Australians - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content. This could prove difficult, with a new Canstar Blue survey finding that the majority of Australians are still not willing to pay for TV content. Around one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see. But this could change in future, with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young Australians are already utilising online streaming services like Stan, Presto, Quickflix and Netflix."}

Scroll down for video. Big Ben switched off its lights for an hour from 8.30pm to mark Earth Hour, an annual event to highlight the effects of climate change. The South Bank was plunged into darkness as Earth Hour started, with the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament turning off the lights. Haunting: Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament blended into the night sky shortly after 8.30pm when the lights were switched off. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was among more than 700 iconic landmarks and monuments worldwide which switched off their lights for Earth Hour. Brandenburg Gate in Berlin also switched off its lights as hundreds gathered in the German capital for the annual event. St Basil's Cathedral also went dark for an hour, starting at 8.30pm local time, to raise awareness about climate change. The annual event started in Asia and Oceania, where Sydney Harbour Bridge descended into darkness as the Australian flag flew above it. Earth Hour started in Samoa and will finish in Tahiti, sweeping through 24 time zones and six continents as some of the most recognisable buildings in the world turned out the lights.

'It is a symbolic and powerful reminder that together we have the power to change things. It should also remind us that we do not have much time in which to make those changes.

England have enjoyed six successive victories since bowing out of the World Cup, and will face World Cup opposition Italy again in Turin on Tuesday. Wayne Rooney is comfortable with the new approach and eager to please the manager, and believes the team is moving in a good direction.", "article": "During the lengthy inquest into England\u2019s dismal performance at last summer\u2019s World Cup, Roy Hodgson reflected on a team that had been roughed up at the highest level. England were bullied off the ball in the opening two games against Italy and Uruguay, showing too much respect for the opposition. Hodgson demanded change. His team had been intimidated by Luis Suarez, second best to every ball, as England were dumped out of the World Cup after just six days. Luis Suarez bullied and dumped England out of the World Cup after just six days in Brazil. Roy Hodgson's side had been intimidated by Suarez in their Group D defeat at the Arena Corinthians. Weeks after the tournament, at a debrief with England\u2019s coaches, Hodgson told his staff that they would go back to basics for the Euro 2016 qualification campaign. The old-school, British mentality was to make a return and for all the right reasons. Hodgson wanted England to be difficult to beat again. He spoke with assistant manager Ray Lewington and coach Gary Neville, telling them he wanted his new England team to have a more muscular presence on the pitch. Hodgson and Gary Neville had discussions on how they could have a more muscular presence on the pitch. The head coach wanted his team to be stronger, to concentrate on the physical characteristics of the game again after those humbling defeats against Italy and Uruguay, plus the dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. Hodgson was convinced his team had gone soft, playing to the gallery as the nation demanded a side that could keep possession and stamp their personality on games in the same way as Spain, Holland, France or Germany. The outcome, after Hodgson (right) claimed he wanted to \u2018bottle what I\u2019m seeing\u2019 during their pre-tournament training camp at Vale de Lobo in Portugal, was elimination from the World Cup. Although Hodgson wanted his team to be slick and to pass the ball with purpose, he vowed that the rough would go with the smooth for the final two years of his contract. In November, when England renewed their rivalry with Scotland at Celtic Park, the coaching staff agreed unanimously that they emerged from the physical confrontation with the upper hand. Hodgson has introduced the tenacious qualities of Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph to the team, encouraging him to make the meaty challenges in the centre of the park. Hodgson wanted to add some extra steel to his England squad and it game in the form of Fabian Delph. Delph has impressed for England since making his debut for England against Switzerland in Basle. \u2018I do like a tackle,\u2019 he admitted on Sunday as England continued their preparations for the prestige friendly against Italy on Tuesday. Less than a year ago, when England played the Italians in the opening World Cup group game in Manaus, Hodgson\u2019s defence could not lay a glove on the Azzurri. Something had to change. The test for this team, with this new rugged approach, is to travel to Turin and secure a result with a depleted team against a side ranked 10th in the world. Wayne Rooney was named England captain and has is eager to please Hodgson and his new strategy. Rooney was in the team against Italy last summer, out on the left in the World Cup opener as Hodgson attempted to accommodate Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge. Everyone has learned a lesson from that. The England captain is comfortable with the new approach, eager to please the manager after adopting a new strategy. So far, with seven successive victories since they exited the World Cup, it has worked. Rooney and England have enjoyed six successive victories since bowing out of the World Cup with a whimper. Rooney said: \u2018You don\u2019t want to go into games with teams enjoying playing against you, you want teams to look at England and think, \u201cWe know we have a tough game. It is going to be physically hard against them, we are going to have to defend and we are going to have to be good on the ball to keep the ball\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s maybe not so much nasty, but being aggressive. Not in a bad way in terms of we are putting really hard tackles in, but we are getting up to the ball quickly, we are harrying teams and making them make mistakes. At the minute we have the tactics right.\u2019 On Tuesday, when the players take the field in Turin, they will be met with the uncompromising Juventus trio of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli in their favoured 3-5-2 formation. On Tuesday England face World Cup opposition Italy again as Hodgson's side travel to Turin. \u2018Italy will be very good on the ball and there will be times when they are able to play out so we have to make sure we pick our moments right and not get picked off,\u2019 added Rooney. \u2018It is moving in a good direction. We are learning"}

His death is being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious' by police.", "article": "David Tuohy, 83, was found dead in the River Thames near his Oxford home just days before he was due to be sentenced for historic sexual assualts. A former headmaster who was found guilty of molesting boys as young as ten at a special needs school in the 1970s has been found dead just days before he was due to be sentenced. The body of David Tuohy, 83, was found floating in the River Thames close to his home in Oxford earlier this week. He was due to be sentenced at Norfolk Crown Court on Monday after earlier being found guilty of 15 counts of sexual assault following a nine-day trial. He was in charge of Eccles Hall School, in Quidenham, Norfolk, in the 1970s when he carried out the indecent and serious sexual assaults against five pupils, who all had special needs and were under 13. Norfolk police confirmed Tuohy had been found dead in the River Thames and said his death was being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious'. A spokesman said: 'Norfolk Constabulary can confirm 83-year-old David William Tuohy who was due to be sentenced after being found guilty of a string of sexual offences against pupils at an independent school has died.' A Thames Valley Police spokesman said a body was reported in the water at around 6pm on Tuesday and the man was declared dead at the scene after being recovered by police divers. Officers had been called to the Osney Lock area of Oxford after a member of the public reported a bloodstain and a watch. Tuohy's family and victims have been informed of his death, police confirmed. Last month, Norfolk Crown Court heard how Tuohy liked to discipline boys who came to the school from different parts of the UK and found themselves alone, isolated and separated from their families. He was also said to be 'obsessed with spanking' and the prosecution said he had a 'particular deviant sexual fascination with the bottoms of very young boys.' Prosecutor Andrew Shaw added: 'It was a boarding school which catered for children who had not thrived in mainstream education in areas all over the country - in today's language we would say they had special educational or behavioural needs. 'They were separated from their families and plunged in to an unfamiliar environment. 'As one of the people charged with the duty of caring for these children, he abused the trust placed in him and used these children for his own sexual gratification.' Detective Constable Faith Morris, from Norfolk Police, said Tuohy had used a position of 'absolute trust' to abuse his victims. 'The fact Tuohy pleaded not guilty to all counts meant his victims were forced to relive the traumatic events which occurred all those years ago,' she said of his trial. Tuohy was a headmaster at Eccles Hall in\u00a0Quidenham, Norfolk, (pictured) in the 1970s when he indecently assaulted five pupils - all of whom had special needs and were aged under 13. He was convicted of 15 charges. Tuohy was originally arrested in June last year and charged with four counts of indecent assault and four counts of buggery against one victim. Four further victims then came forward resulting in Tuohy being charged with a further 14 indecent assaults. All of the charges related to five boys, who were aged under 13, between September 1972 and March 1983. He was found not guilty of three of the indecent assault charges and the four buggery charges but convicted of the remaining 15 indecent assaults. The sex abuse came to light when one of the victims reported it to police, prompting other victims to come forward. Eccles Hall, which is now known as the New Eccles Hall School, is an independent day and boarding school in East Anglia for children aged seven to 18.

But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom. And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes. A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown. Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqu\u00e9 depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen. Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast. Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal. One particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of Prince George's 2013 Christening, with one photo showing the Queen looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her. Others show a nude William and Kate in the bath with George and another in which the Duchess of Cambridge carefully changes her son's nappy.

{"abstract": "Chick sexers are paid \u00a340,000 a year to determine the gender of newly-hatched chicks, but the industry is struggling to recruit due to the nature of the job and lack of awareness.

The industry is now facing a staff shortage that is threatening exports, and the job is not seen as attractive due to the long hours spent staring at the backside of a chick.", "article": "'Chick sexers' are paid \u00a340,000 a year to spend their days with tens of thousands of fluffy chicks. But despite the seemingly attractive offer, Britain's poultry industry is struggling to recruit and is now facing a staff shortage that is threatening exports. The problem, according to one industry chief, lies in the nature of the job: sexers spend 12 hours a day'staring at the backside of a chick'. And each new recruit must spend three years learning how to do it. Scroll down for video. Chicken sexers: Workers spot the'minuscule differences' in the size and shape of each one-day-old chick's genitalia - known as its'vent' - to determine whether it will be a rooster, or will one day lay eggs. Andrew Large, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, added that another part of the problem is that the awareness of the role is not as high as it could be. Each future 'chick sexer' receives years in training in how to spot'minuscule differences' in the size and shape of a newly-hatched chick's genitalia to determine whether it will be a rooster or a hen. They are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day-old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent. This must be done for as long as it takes to fill an order, which can be up to 13 hours. And each chick must have its genitalia - known as its'vent' - checked without being harmed, Mr Large told\u00a0The Times. Delicate: Each chick must be handled with care. Although the checking technique can be taught relatively quickly, the ability to maintain standards for such long periods at such level of intensity has to be developed over a longer time. In 2013 the industry failed to recruit a single'vent chick sexer' and asked for the job to be added to an official government list of occupations with staff shortages. Mr Large told The Times: 'It takes three years to train someone so they \u00a0develop the sensitivity and dexterity to reliably sex the bird and a lot of people don't want to spend that amount of time training. 'I think the problem is the job itself. You are spending hours every day staring at the backside of a chick. That is not seen as being attractive. 'In southeast Asia a chick sexer is a high status job. In the UK it is more likely to be the butt of humour.' There are an estimated 100 to 150 chick sexers in the country but a shortage of 15 workers means the industry risks losing overseas clients. But the Migration Management Committee, who advises the government on whether a job should be added to the shortage list, ruled that chick sexing should not be included. Chick sexing has previously made headlines as a number of the birds - mainly male - are discarded and killed if they are surplus to the requirement of the order. When asked by MailOnline whether this could affect the number of jobseekers applying for jobs as chick sexers, Mr Large said it was not an issue that had been raised with them. He added that it was only if the birds did not fit the order, and could not be redirected to meat production, that they were 'humanely culled'. Waiting to be checked: Chick sexers are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day-old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent."}

'The message is simply, instead of washing it in the wrong way, you might as well give it to a lady because they are more capable,' the company tweeted on Sunday. 'There is no intention to humiliate women. In contrast [we want to tell the men] learn from women how to take care of clothes.' The company has not said whether they will recall the shirts. 'The message is simply, instead of washing it in the wrong way, you might as well give it to a lady because they are more capable,' a tweet from the company reads. 'There is no intention to humiliate women. In contrast [we want to tell the men] learn from women how to take care of clothes' The shirt controversy caps off a rough week for the sporting industry, with claims of sexist behaviour at the highest levels of the sport making news. A women's international football match between Australia and England, played near a military base in Cyprus, has been overshadowed by claims British soldiers shouted sexist abuse at Australian players throughout the match. FFA Media Operations spokesman Adam Mark said a formal report was currently being prepared by the team in Europe, and it will be reviewed before any potential action is discussed or taken. England's FA and the Ministry of Defence are also investigating the claims. The women's international match was marred by reports of abusive comments and behaviour from British soldiers watching on from the stands. The match was played near a British military base in Cyprus, where it is believed many of the soldiers were based (Stock image) 'We're waiting for the report before commenting. It would be inappropriate to say anything at this time,' Mr Mark told Daily Mail Australia. The alleged incident comes just days after the launch of the 'Women in Football' campaign designed to promote equality in the sport and 'tackle sexism in the game'. Rachel O'Sullivan, a UK journalist for the Girls on the Ball\u00a0website, claimed about 10 of the 50 soldiers abused the women at the game in Nicosia, Cyprus on Friday. 'They were making horrible comments, shouting, whistling,' Ms O'Sullivan said. 'One Australian player, No.6 [Uzunlar], they were harassing her over and over and over again, throughout the game. 'These are teenage girls and they were sexually objectifying them.' Football Federation of Australia and England's Football Association are investigating the alleged incident, which comes just days after the launch of the 'Women in Football' campaign designed to promote equality in the sport and 'tackle sexism in the game' 'We're waiting for the report before commenting. It would be inappropriate to say anything at this time,' Mr Mark told Daily Mail Australia. Sophie Downey, who also writes for Girls on the Ball, said she had been hesitant to report on the comments. 'At the end of the day we are just two young women who just love our football and want to support our team,' Ms Downey wrote. 'But we have sat through more than our fair share of women's games and we have never witnessed anything quite like it. Why should we keep quiet?' Servet Uzunlar, pictured in action with Sydney FC, was harassed 'over and over again', according to reports. She also said it was important to highlight such behaviour to ensure all fans understand it is 'offensive and unacceptable'. 'Until the opinion that it's just 'banter' and 'lads being lads' is challenged and dissipates, things will never change,' she said. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman was taking a more open approach.

{"abstract": "The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has recently been accused of executing eight men and three women for alleged homosexual and adulterous acts. The gruesome nature of these executions is meant to spread terror among those who do not conform to traditional gender norms. The international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence, while applications for asylum should be expedited.", "article": "(CNN)The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is making headlines again. On Wednesday, images began circulating from the city of Raqqa in Syria of a man being thrown off a building, allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act. The scene is sickening and horrifying. And it's meant to be, because ISIS is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like, do, or say. This latest execution is the eighth that ISIS has claimed it carried out for sodomy. In addition, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has reported the murders of four more men, also accused of sodomy, who were killed in similar style by ISIS in Syria. ISIS is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in Syria accused of adultery. It's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize. Some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death (and in some cases both). In its social media postings about the executions, ISIS shows victims being brought to a city center, with militants purporting to read from a self-styled \"court\" ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd. A final picture usually depicts a lifeless body. The militia's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention: to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror. The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), of course, condemns these acts. But it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves. Indeed, despite our efforts, and those of other independent observers, neither the accusations nor the exact nature, time, and location of the executions can be corroborated. We know nothing about the victims' sexual orientation or gender identity. Without evidence or independent confirmation, we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved. Still, whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases, as IGLHRC and the women's rights organization MADRE have\u00a0asserted, the public and gruesome nature of these executions, and ISIS's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be \"sodomy,\" raise concerns for anyone in Iraq or Syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about \"proper\" women and men. And the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under ISIS's control. For Iraqi individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms, living under the rule of ISIS means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence, as pointed out in our report with MADRE and the Baghdad-based Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq. Where do we go from here? There are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of ISIS. The antidote to their bleak worldview will be long-term and hard-won, rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities. However, the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today. Internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to U.N. agencies and human rights NGOs who work directly with vulnerable people. Meanwhile, applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited. We cannot sit idly by while ISIS commits wanton violence in the name of protecting \"morality.\""}

Winnie first spoke publicly about her skin condition in 2011 by posting a video to YouTube titled 'Vitiligo: A Skin Condition not a Life Changer' and now she's hugely in demand. She was cruelly nicknamed 'zebra' and 'cow' because of the white patches covering her face and body growing up. Michael Jackson famously had the same condition and explained his pale complexion was  a result of the lack of melanin in his skin.

'When I got older, it got harder because when kids get older they get meaner, so I went through a lot of bullying and people calling me like zebra or cow so it was really hard growing up.'

Vitiligo occurs when the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that determines the color of skin, die or stop functioning. This causes slowly enlarging white patches of irregular shapes to appear on the skin over time. Vitiligo affects all races, but may be more noticeable in people with darker skin. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, although many experts believe that it is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys certain cells. There is no cure and the goal of treatment, which can include ointments and skin grafts, is to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss.

The controversy has raised a broader question of how explicitly artists need to state that allusions to history's darkest chapters are meant to condemn rather than condone.", "article": "A debut at Carnegie Hall meant to showcase a young composer was abruptly canceled after management realized it featured a snippet of a Nazi German anthem. The New York Youth Symphony was set to premiere the orchestral work on Sunday at the prestigious concert hall but the orchestra's management removed it, saying that such an explosive musical reference required a longer conversation. No one has suggested any Nazi sympathy by composer Jonas Tarm, a 21-year-old Estonian American, who intended for the work to deplore war including recent bloodshed in Ukraine. Composer:\u00a0The New York Youth Symphony canceled Jonas Tarm's 'Marsh u Nebuttya' after management realized it featured a snippet of a Nazi German anthem. Piece: Tarm uploaded this photograph of his work\u00a0'Marsh u Nebuttya,' which is Ukrainian for 'March to Oblivion.' It featured both a portion from the Nazi song 'Horst-Wessel-Lied' and the anthem of Soviet-ruled Ukraine. But the controversy raised a broader question -- how explicitly do artists need to state that allusions to history's darkest chapters are meant to condemn rather than condone? The New York Youth Symphony, which recognizes performers and composers under age 22, said Tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of 'Horst-Wessel-Lied,' one of the Nazis' main anthems which is banned in modern Germany and Austria. The symphony said that the nine-minute piece could have been 'an important teaching moment for our students' but that Tarm refused to lay out his reasons for using 'Horst-Wessel-Lied.' 'Without this information, and given the lack of transparency and lack of parental consent to engage with this music, we could not continue to feature his work on the program,' the symphony said in a statement. 'We believe deeply in a free creative process. But along with freedom comes responsibility, even more so when young people are involved,' it said. Tarm had entitled his work 'Marsh u Nebuttya,' which is Ukrainian for 'March to Oblivion,' and it also incorporated the anthem of Soviet-ruled Ukraine. He initially explained his work only with a dedication in the program 'to the victims of hunger and fire' and an excerpt from T.S. Eliot's post-World War I poem 'The Hollow Men.' 'Between the conception and the creation / Between the emotion and the response / Falls the Shadow,' runs the verse from Eliot, who is often considered the premier 20th century English-language poet but also faced accusations of anti-Semitism. Disclosure: The New York Youth Symphony said Tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of 'Horst-Wessel-Lied,' one of the Nazis' main anthems. The song is  banned in modern Germany and Austria. Upset: After Tarm's Carnegie Hall (pictured) debut was cancelled, Tarm spoke more at length, saying he was 'disappointed and confused' by the rejection of a piece 'not meant to provoke, but to evoke. Intent: Tarm has said the piece is 'devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war, totalitarianism, polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today' Music speaks for itself? After the cancelation, Tarm spoke more at length, saying he was 'disappointed and confused' by the rejection of a piece 'not meant to provoke, but to evoke.' The piece ''s devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war, totalitarianism, polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today,' he said in a statement. 'The old joke about how do you get to Carnegie Hall -- you practice. Apparently, you also have to self-censor. I'm disappointed that this work will no longer have the ability to speak for itself,' he said. Tarm, who is studying at the New England Conservatory in Boston, said that the orchestra had been practicing the piece for weeks without any complaints. The controversy has echoes of a furor last year at the Metropolitan Opera which staged John Adams' 'The Death of Klinghoffer,' about the wheelchair-bound Jewish American Leon Klinghoffer who was killed by Palestinian hijackers of a cruise ship in 1985. Protesters rallied outside and several disrupted performances in part because Palestinian characters in the opera make anti-Semitic remarks as Adams tries to set the context for the killing. Ken Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League, which fights anti-Semitism and racism, said that he could not judge the canceled Carnegie Hall piece without listening to it but urged reflection before banning artwork that cites offensive material. 'I assume that the New York Youth Symphony did what it did out of good motives. But I would also say that in works of art, one has to be thoughtful and careful before one wants to censor,' he told AFP. The orchestra went ahead Sunday with a performance that featured rising violinist Elena Urioste, who performed Be"}

Tippetts wrote to her: 'You have been told a lie. A horrible lie, that your dying will not be beautiful. That the suffering will be too great. 'I pray (my words) reach the multitudes that are looking at your story and believing the lie that suffering is a mistake, that dying isn't to be braved, that choosing our death is the courageous story.' She went on: 'In your choosing your own death, you are robbing those that love you with the such tenderness, the opportunity of meeting you in your last moments and extending you love in your last breaths.' But Tippetts also thanked Maynard for sharing her story and told her she loved her. Speaking in an earlier interview, Maynard had explained: 'There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die. I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.' Plea: She famously penned an open letter to Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old brain cancer sufferer (pictured) who took her life last November. Tippetts had pleaded with Maynard to die naturally. Maynard, who was married, died on November 1, 2014 aged just 29. After the letter was shared thousands of times online, Tippetts' book, 'The Hardest Peace', soared to number 14 on Amazon's bestseller list. Tippetts said she was shocked.

GPs will be able to prescribe the apps to patients put off by the prospect of talking to a counsellor. Health chiefs believe they will also help millions of people unwilling to go to a doctor in the first place.

A new generation of apps has been launched to help people cope with stress, anxiety and depression \u2013 just by using their mobile phones.

He said: \u2018If people want and need one-to-one counselling, then that\u2019s absolutely what they will get. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression worldwide. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, it said. GPs will be able to prescribe the apps for mobile phones to patients put off by the prospect of talking to a counsellor. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Suicide results in an estimated 1 million deaths every year, the WHO warns. In recent studies, depression has also been found to affect the way that people experience time. Research found that time seems to pass extremely slowly or even stand still when a person suffers from depression. Dr Daniel Oberfeld-Twistel, of  Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, said: 'Psychiatrists and psychologists in hospitals and private practices repeatedly report that depressed patients feel that time only creeps forward slowly or is passing in slow motion. 'We found strong indicators that in depressed individuals the subjective feeling of the passage of time differs from the ability to assess the actual duration of external events.' His team looked at the results from 16 individual studies in which 433 depressed people and 485 non-depressed people participated. In the studies, the participants were asked to estimate the duration of periods of time. The results obtained for the depressed subjects were exactly the same as those for the healthy ones without any relevant statistical difference. 'We found strong indicators that in depressed individuals the subjective feeling of the passage of time differs from the ability to assess the actual duration of external events,' concluded Dr Oberfeld-Twistel. He added his team identified several aspects of the relation between depression and time perception that have not yet been investigated adequately. Little is actually known about the effects of antidepressants and psychotherapy, or how patients with bipolar disorders compared to non-bipolar depression assess the passing of time. Future studies need to clearly differentiate between the subjective perception of the passage of time, and a person's ability to estimate the precisely defined lengths of time, he added. Flintoff, once almost as well known for his partying ways as he was for his cricketing skills, spoke candidly about his\u00a0battles with mental illness and alcohol earlier this month on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! The 37-year-old also casually mentioned he no longer indulges with alcohol, and when asked why explained: 'I genuinely thought I had enough of it... I suffer with depression and it doesn't help at all, [you] just hit rock bottom afterwards.' Moment of realisation: The athlete and media personality revealed that he realised he struggled with the mental illness when he did a documentary on depression in sports. Freddie said that he still goes out on the town but that there's no alcohol involved when he does, telling that after one drink, 'you kind of drink to change how you feel and it's just bad.' 'Life's so much easier with not having any... the things that tend to go wrong are drink fuelled.' The athlete and media personality revealed that he realised he struggled with the mental illness when he did a documentary on depression in sports. 'I never knew what it was and I've always never said anything, and speaking to other people I identified with how I felt and I could sort it out, treat it.'"}

Any suggestion that the mild-mannered forward might throw in the towel, however, has been a definite non-starter. Deemed unsuitable for Gordon Strachan\u2019s favoured high-energy 4-2-3-1 system, a conciliatory Rhodes vowed that if he couldn\u2019t change his game he would certainly bust a gut to try to improve it. Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes talks to Scotland boss Gordon Strachan on the touchline on Wednesday. Then, left out by Gary Bowyer for Blackburn\u2019s FA Cup goalless draw against Liverpool at Anfield earlier this month, the 25-year-old again elected to keep his counsel. In an era when young millionaires aren\u2019t slow to sound off about their perceived woes, the \u00a38million man\u2019s riposte was delivered silently on the park. A winning goal in his first game back against Bolton was followed up by a deadly double at Charlton the following week. It led to a \u00a310m bid for his services from Middlesbrough, swiftly booted out by Blackburn owners Venkys two weeks ago. Kevin Gallacher, the former Blackburn and Scotland striker, is a big fan of Rhodes but admits there were times he feared there might be parallels between the hitman and Kris Boyd. Jordan Rhodes (left) challenges Northern Ireland's Aaron Hughes during the 1-0 victory. Boyd may have been the finest goal-grabber Scotland has produced in recent years, but the flaws in his overall game limited him to just 18 international caps and seven goals for his country. Gallacher has been impressed, however, to see Rhodes show a fighting quality to match his efficiency in front of the net. The boy seemingly without a temper has rolled up his sleeves and scrapped it out to win his first Scotland call-up since November 2013. Gallacher now feels Rhodes could be a key player on Sunday against whipping boys Gibraltar in a European qualifying group where goal difference could prove decisive. \u2018Jordan\u2019s not egotistical. He wouldn\u2019t spit the dummy,\u2019 said Gallacher. \u2018But he\u2019 s a real predator. Even though it\u2019s not been his best season he\u2019s still got 16 goals this season for Blackburn. Rhodes in action during his last Scotland call-up which was back in November 2013. \u2018We had someone like that before in Kris Boyd. But for some reason Kris never got the opportunity at national level to get many caps and many goals. Jordan had seemed to be going along similar lines. But he\u2019s up for the battle. He\u2019s proven that at Blackburn, where he has found it difficult this season. He\u2019s been in and out of the side. But he came back in and got a few goals and put pressure on the manager. \u2018I know he\u2019s elated to be back in the Scotland squad for the Northern Ireland and Gibraltar games and he\u2019ll be looking to start. He\u2019s got to take his chance when it comes. Since Poland and Ireland have both taken seven off Gibraltar, I\u2019 ve a feeling this group is going to come down to goal difference \u2013 and Jordan can certainly score goals.\u2019 Gallacher recalls Rhodes facing a tough baptism of fire at Blackburn where fans viewed him as a striker proven only in the lower tiers of English football with Huddersfield. But if ever a pedigree for scoring against mediocre opposition comes in handy, it\u2019s against a Gibraltar team so new on the scene they have no FIFA ranking. Rhodes, in action against Northern Ireland, will hope to feature in Sunday's contest with Gibraltar. \u2018Jordan was scoring 20-plus goals a season but people questioned him when Blackburn bought him for \u00a38million,\u2019 said Gallacher, now 48. \u2018He wasn\u2019t tried and tested in the English Championship. I do think people worry because he hadn\u2019t played and scored at the highest level. And maybe that\u2019 s in the back of your mind as a manager. \u2018But it\u2019s up to Jordan to keep his head down \u2013 as he does \u2013 and to work hard and score goals. His game is all about goalscoring but at international level you need to do that tiny little bit extra if you want to succeed. But that\u2019s what Jordan\u2019s been working hard at. He\u2019s shown he will try his best to do what it takes to get back in.\u2019 By a quirk of fate, the last time Scotland reached a major finals, Blackburn Rovers striker Gallacher\u2019s goals secured Craig Brown\u2019s team a place at the World Cup in France.

One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan has been placed in solitary confinement after smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his prison cell, it has been claimed. The 31-year-old, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers\u00a0Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, had been running a criminal network from HM Prison Manchester, sources said. Prison staff have come under fire for the reported security breach with critics slamming the alleged oversight as'really embarrassing'. Cregan is serving a life sentence after shooting dead PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes as well as father and son David and Mark Short in Manchester in 2012. The gangster admitted the attempted murder of three others in a high profile court case the following year. He was told he would never see release after admitting to the killings which prompted public outcry and an outpouring of sympathy for the police. It is the second time he has been caught smuggling drugs into the prison, known as Strangeways, since being put behind bars. But having managed to get hold of a phone to direct illegal activity on the streets, critics are demanding his case be used to set an example. 'If the authorities cannot stop dangerous criminals like this continuing their activities from the inside then the Government will have to step in,' Tory MP Philip Davies told the Sun's Jake Ryan. 'Dale Cregan is not the only prisoner with a phone because security is so lax and we might have to block mobile signals in prisons if it can't be stopped by the authorities.' A prison source added the blunder had been'really embarrassing' for staff who were now under fire from bosses. 'It's really embarrassing for the prison that one of the country's most dangerous prisoners has got a hold of a phone and drugs again.' The 31-year-old is serving a life sentence at HM Prison Manchester (above) where staff have come under fire for the reported breach. Officers Fiona Bone (left) and Nicola Hughes (right) were killed by Cregan after being lured into a house. Cregan went on the run in 2012 after murdering David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, in a bar fight. The killer, who has one eye after losing the other in a separate brawl, lured officers Bone and Hughes into a house in September 2012. In October last year staff at the Category A prison faced questions after the murderer tested positive for cannabis in a random drug test. At the time a spokesman for the prison said: \u201cThe availability of illicit drugs in our prisons impacts greatly on prison life and can lead to violence and intimidation of both prisoners and their family.' Earlier this year one of the key witnesses in his case revealed she had fled the country after receiving threats from the gangster's cronies online. The woman, who has not been named, refused to say where she was in the world but that she had been contacted by friends of Cregan threatening her life. She claimed she had been left destitute and without work after testifying for the Crown Prosecution Service. Greater Manchester Police declined to comment on her claims at the time on the grounds the force does not speak to individual cases involving witness protection. Murdered by Cregan: Mark Short (right) and his father David. The key witness who helped put Cregan behind bars for the killings that shocked the nation came under intense threats from gangland thugs before the trial. On the night Mark Short was shot dead, the woman saw one of Cregan's co-accused, Damian Gorman, outside her house with two other people. Giving evidence to the trial via video link, she said she also found clothes dumped\u00a0in a garden next to her home the next day. She said she faced threats after Short was killed, including one of the 'one-eyed Scotchman' - a reference to Cregan - paying her a visit. The trial heard Gorman had told her: 'You better make sure that you keep your f****** mouth shut or you're dead... You see these people, what they are capable of. You're f****** next. You and your f****** kids.' 'He said, \"Be careful because you don't want the one-eyed Scotchman coming to [your] door\"... If I said anything to the police,' she said. She said he pulled his finger under his chin and across his throat and told her: 'You don't want to die and you don't want your kids to die.' 'He was always threatening me. The message he gave me was clear,' she added."}

She also struggles with hot flushes and difficulty learning lines due to menopause.", "article": "Lasting love: The star with husband Grant Roffey. Having forged a career starring in Hollywood blockbusters and packed theatres, people might assume Julie Walters to be brimming with confidence. But the veteran star has revealed that when it came to romance in her younger years, she relied on a helping hand from alcohol to bring her out of her shell. The mother-of-one, 65, has admitted that before meeting her husband Grant Roffey, 57, thirty years ago, she had never had sex while sober. However, now she has been diagnosed with a yeast allergy she almost never drinks and, on the rare occasions she does, hates the effect it has on her health. In a candid interview, she also reveals she is finding it increasingly difficult to learn her lines, a problem she has increasingly found as she stars in new series Indian Summers. The Mamma Mia! star met Mr Roffey while she was starring in a production of Macbeth and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately but they only married in 1997, 11 years into their relationship. Talking to Saga magazine, she has said how their first encounter ended with a drunken tryst and that, at that time in her life, she always needed to drink before being able to have sex. She described how she and a friend had drunk three bottles of champagne before bumping into her future husband at a bar in Leicester. She said: \u2018It was full of Hooray Henries. I remember saying, \u201cI bet nobody here\u2019s a member of the Labour Party.\u201d And he turned round and said, \u201cWell I am, actually.\u201d \u2018\u201cCor, you\u2019re massive! Look at this bloke\u2019s neck. God, it\u2019s as big as my thigh!\u201d I was so embarrassing. We started talking about God knows what, and when Ros [her friend] and I left he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you home.\u201d And we staggered out with him. \u2018So we walked Ros home, then he walked me home. I said, \u201cCome in!\u201d He said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s all right.\u201d I said, \u201cCome iiiiinnn! I\u2019ve got a bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau!\u201d He moved in and never moved out. It was instant for me. \u2018I remember saying, \u201cDo you want my children?\u201d That first night \u2013 terrible things! \u2013 it was driven by alcohol. I was shy like that. Who\u2019d have sex without alcohol? Especially the first time. He was really sweet about it. Before we were together, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever done it sober.\u2019 While she might owe her happy marriage to alcohol, she now hardly touches a drop due to a yeast allergy. She explains that she had always felt ill after drinking but assumed it was the same for everyone. It was only well into adulthood that a doctor suggested an allergy test that revealed the true cause. The actress met her husband in 1986 and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately. Pictured, Julie flaunts her sexy side that same year in comedy Car Trouble. She said: \u2018If I were to have Marmite, it would just take the roof of my mouth right off. Anything with yeast makes my eyes go funny, makes me a bit wheezy. \u2018And before, when I\u2019d had a few drinks, the next day I\u2019d always have these flu-like symptoms. I thought everybody had those, and I was telling this gynaecologist \u2026 and she suggested a skin test to see if I was allergic to anything. And the yeast went, whoo! So now I know.\u2019 Even so, she still occasionally has the odd glass of champagne if she needs a quick boost of confidence. She said she never drinks, \u2018except, say, if I got on Graham Norton where you have to be jolly with people you\u2019ve not met before, and I have a glass of champagne. But I don\u2019t like the effect on my body.\u2019 This is not the only problem alcohol has caused for her health. Ever since she entered menopause at the age of 50, she had been unable to sleep after drinking. She has spoken before of her struggles with menopause and again said how she continues to suffer with hot flushes after 15 years. She said: \u2018It was like a chimney and came from the base of my spine. I was doing this TV called Murder, and every take there\u2019d be, \u201cStop, she\u2019s having a flush!\u201d The actress also revealed she is finding it difficult to learn the lines for current Channel 4 series Indian Summers, in which she plays Cynthia (pictured) \u2018At the National I\u2019d come off stage for a"}

But six months later, the three-time Olympic gold medalist's office at the Misty May-Treanor Sports Center is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer Mike Rangel, who founded the Irvine facility. Now parents are threatening to stop paying their  seasonal dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-Treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised. Scroll down for video. Olympic gold-medalist Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name. Brand new: The 155,000-square-foot Misty May-Treanor Sports Center was opened in November 2014. Parents pay $4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven-month season. Boycotts: Some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because May-Treanor has not been involved at the facility recently. In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May-Treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May-Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike. 'I can respect the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing Asics gear,' Rangel said. However, rumors abound in the club about a deeper-seeded issue that caused May-Treanor's distance, and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club's website. Cary Lambeth, a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the MMTSC believes the break is 'because their visions were not the same'. 'I do not think Misty was doing it for Misty. I think Misty was doing it because she wanted to give back,' Lambeth said. Daily Mail Online reached out to May-Treanor's agent for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately get a reply. Calls to Mike Rangel were also not returned. May-Treanor's apparent rift with Rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship. In her 2010 autobiography, she described her relationship with Rangel as 'one of the most important partnerships' in her volleyball career. Rangel helped train May-Treanor between 2002 and 2012, during which she won three gold medals in the Olympics for beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. The split was also swift. May-Treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in August, and even gave excited interviews about the club in October. But since then it's been radio silence. Checked out: May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the MMTSC since October. The sports legend pictured on the left with a Laguna Hills High School senior at the facility on October 2. Legend: It's still unclear what caused the rift between May-Treanor and her longtime trainer Rangel. Rangel trained May-Treanor for 12 years, during which she won three Olympic gold medals in beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. May-Treanor pictured above compting in the London Olympic games. Erased: The club's website now shows now sign of Misty May-Treanor's name or image on the homepage. In October, May-Treanor told the OC Register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart, since she grew up in the area and knew there weren't many places for local kids to play. 'Growing up as a volleyball player around here, I know how gym space had become more and more limited,' May-Treanor said. 'This is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports, too. With the amount of sports and teams we have here, it\u2019s important to have a facility like this.' Brand minded? Rangel says the split with May-Treanor stems from a sponsorship issue. Asics is sponsoring the club, while May-Treanor remains a spokesman for Nike. May-Treanor and Jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the London games. She also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center. 'I love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we\u2019ll be doing,' May-Treanor said. 'That\u2019s the big part for me, the sharing of information with younger players. And the beauty of this is that I don\u2019t have to be dedicated to one team.' May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier"}

'I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. 'It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.'

There had been rumours that a factory would be created in Coventry, possibly to build the revamped Defender. Manufacture of the current version of the all-terrain vehicle, first made in 1948 and one of the first cars owned by the Queen after she came to the throne in 1952, is due to end in December after a series of special editions roll off the production line.

A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Indian industrial giant Tata, said: 'We will create a new version of the Defender but no decision has been made on where it will be built or when.' Commenting on the future of the existing model, the spokesman added: 'We are investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility for sale outside of the EU, after we cease building in the UK.' This could mean it being built at Jaguar Land Rover's factories in Brazil or China. Three-quarters of the two million Defenders built since launch are still in regular use. A prototype of the new generation 4x4 was unveiled in 2011, and yesterday's announcement brings it a step closer.

Melissa Whiting told officials she lived alone with her three children and raked in income support, housing benefit and council tax relief, a court heard. But in reality, she was sharing her Darlington home with boyfriend Mark Briscoe - a former soldier working in private security in the Middle East. In one year, he was able to deposit \u00a39,000 into his 33-year-old girlfriend's account - all the while claiming benefits, using them as a 'financial safety net'. It also enabled her to pay for family holidays to Majorca and Bulgaria, as well as a\u00a0\u00a31,000-plus sofa, fridge, washing machine, flooring and a Sky subscription. Her deception was discovered in 2013, although she initially denied being in a relationship with Mr Briscoe. However, her neighbours knew they were a couple, and Teesside Crown Court heard Mr Briscoe also had his car registered at the Darlington property, and his pension correspondence from the army went there. Eventually, Whiting admitted two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstances, and yesterday she was given a two-month suspended prison sentence. The judge, Recorder Martin Bethel, QC, described her dishonesty as 'blatant' and also ordered Whiting, of Chestnut Drive, to pay \u00a3400 costs. Penny Bottomley, mitigating, told the court that the fathers of Whiting's first two children 'contributed very little to their upbringing'. She added: 'Her explanation to the Probation Service for continuing to claim benefits is it was a financial safety net for her and her children. 'That's somewhat understandable given she had spent the past 11 years receiving very little money from their fathers. 'She accepts it was wrong.' Miss Bottomley told the judge that unemployed Whiting had struggled with a gambling addiction at one point, but that was 'now being managed'. The youngest of the defendant's three children - Mr Briscoe is the father - is three, and the others are aged seven and 11, the court was told. Prosecutor Nigel Soppitt said the allegation was she claimed more than \u00a311,800 over 18 months, but the defence case is that it was \u00a35,000 over nine months."}

But for some, the time spent at some of the highest spots in Europe is focused more on drinking, sex and partying into the small hours. Welcome to the Andorran resort of Pas De La Casa, where it seems holidays are all about boarding, bargain booze and budget holidays. Scroll down for video. Pas De La Casa is all about boarding, bargain booze and budget holidays. Channel 5 documentary Brits on the Piste has looked in to the antics of the workers who spend the winter season in the mountains and the holidaymakers who visit. And the series, currently airing, has proved so popular that viewing figures doubled over the first two episodes. With Pas De La Casa having the reputation as having the one of the best nightlife scenes of any ski resort, it's certainly an eye-opening experience. The four main bars, that are packed out during ski season, are The Milwaukee, Underground, Paddy's Bar and The Shamrocks. From downing shots in the bars, to having an early morning skiing lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave' and partying with DJ Craig, the 'Pete Tong of Pas', all things are covered. And it's not just the visitors behaving badly. The 30 or so British workers at the resort will often drink and part as much as the tourists, with one worker admitting she will have about '20 shots' while working behind the bar. Fellow barman Danny admits that in the previous season he slept with 15 girls, but says he is aiming for 22-25 this season. Despite the cold weather, there's always time to take to the Jacuzzi, and these tourists from Wales take the plunge. Following a night on the tiles, it wouldn't be wise to miss your early morning ski lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave,' pictured here with bar worker Beth. It seems skiing is not particularly high on the agenda for visitors, despite the high costs of booking winter holidays. Two lively party girls from Ireland find themselves on holiday for five days longer than they planned in episode three, while competitive Craig organises an alcohol-fuelled snowman-building competition, and three hungover resort workers go heli-skiing. 'We were meant to book it for five days,' say the two Irish visitors. 'But we hit the wrong button on Ryanair and we're here for ten.' 'Everyone keeps saying to us 'you're total p*******s and you're not going to make the slopes,' but realistically probably all we'll make is one day on the slopes.' Group trips are particularly popular at the bargain resort. Fierce drinking battles between Team Essex and Team Bournemouth - a groups of friends who had swapped sand for snow to party hard - take place in the resort's bars. Both sides of life at the ski resort are show here, from necking beers and shots on a wild night out, to a moment of romance as Joe proposes to his girlfriend Michelle on the slopes. A group of party animals from Yorkshire get into the spirit to celebrate one of their birthdays. Meanwhile three brothers from Kidderminster, who are travelling to the resort for the first time without their parents, are under no illusions what they're there for. Engineer Scott, 19, says: 'This year we're allowed to go mental, completely mental. Just go out there and get smashed, every night, just drink hard and ski harder.' Twenty bottles of J\u00e4germeister and a further 20 of vodka are sold every night in the resort's bars, so it's little wonder party animals flood the venue. The resort is very male-dominant, with 95 per cent of those who stay there being men. And where alcohol and pride is concerned, this can lead to a tense atmosphere at time. Episode four shows how things can take a turn for the worst as skiing takes a back seat for most of the holidaymakers, replaced with drinking, vomiting and fighting. A group of lads from Leeds talk through how the drinking games fit into skiing. This pair from Essex are forced to show their drinking prowess when they come up with some rival holiday-goers from Bournemouth. 'If you fall over it's a shot, if you fall over coming off a ski-lift that's two shots, if you mack (take) somebody out that's a pint,' says Byron. 'If you're sick that's five shots,' adds his friend Johnny. 'It's just a vicious circle basically.' The show also explores those much-discussed resort relationships, from bar workers Danny from Paddy's and Milwaukee's Beth. Despite being on, off and then on again, the pair work out how they are going to surprise each other for Valentine's Day. And in the latest offering, the other side of life at the ski resort is revealed when Joe from Stevenage pops the question to his girlfriend Michelle"}

It's been a season in which Sonequa Martin-Green's character, Sasha, stood out: She's on the verge of insanity after the deaths of her brother and many friends. \"We went to a very deep place,\" Martin-Green said. \"It was hard, depressing, bad and thrilling all at the same time. A lot of the stuff was quite challenging for me. It was something I can definitely look back on and be proud of.\" With Rick having gone on a blood-soaked, gun-wielding rant in front of the leaders of the Alexandria community, his fate and that of his fellow survivors hangs in the balance. \"There's gonna be all the twists and turns you would expect and twists and turns you did not expect,\" Martin-Green said of the episode. \"The finale is probably the most jam-packed episode there's ever been.

In Malawi, gangs of men have been hunting albinos to sell their body parts for a fortune. The UN has called on regional governments to ensure the criminals behind the attacks are prosecuted, but so far no buyers have been held accountable.", "article": "This is the first picture of a six-year-old boy whose hand was savagely hacked off by hired assassins who collect albino body parts for witchdoctors to turn into charms and potions for their rich clients. Baraka Cosmas was attacked on Saturday evening by a group of men, who stormed into the home he shared with his parents in western Tanzania. The young boy was held down while the gang chopped off his right hand, before beating him and his mother Prisca Shaaban so badly both have been hospitalised. Scroll down for video. Savage attack: A group of men hacked off six-year-old Baraka Cosmas' right hand on Saturday night. Trade: He is the latest in a long line of albino victims in Tanzania, targeted because their skin is thought to have magical properties which can bring luck and wealth - something people are willing to pay high prices for. Shockingly, Baraka was the third child to be attacked because of the colour of his skin in just over three months. Eighteen-month-old\u00a0Yohana Bahati was snatched from his home less than a month ago, while four-year-old Pendo Emmanuelle Nandi was taken at the end of December. Yohana's mutilated body was found a few days later, while Pendo has never been seen again. All three cases are linked to a trade in albino body parts, fuelled by the high prices they fetch and a belief in the'magical' properties of the skin and limbs, said to bring wealth and luck. The men who viciously attacked Baraka at the weekend are likely to have been little more than petty criminals at worst, carrying out the bidding of a witchdoctor. The witchdoctor will have paid a significant amount for the limb - but who paid the witchdoctor is likely to remain unclear. Jonathan Beale, managing director of Standing Voice, a charity working to protect Tanzania's albinos, says until these people are rooted out, government efforts to curb the attacks and killings are likely to have little impact. 'This most recent tragic attack serves to remind us that current responses from the government, police force and justice system are not sufficient and do not target the heart of this crisis,' he told MailOnline. Hidden: Many children are now kept in special schools, away from their families and behind protective walls. Children are being snatched from their beds as gangs of men roam southern Malawi hunting as demand for albino body parts fuels a surge in attacks and murders leaving people in fear of their lives, the U.N. has said. The country, which borders Tanzania in the west, has seen a horrific rise in the numbers attacked or killed since January. Already, there have been six attacks in 2015 - compared to just four over the previous two years. Victims have ranged from a year old, to 68, with children being snatched from their beds as they sleep. And just as in Tanzania, it seems the high value of the limbs is driving the trade. An uncle, among three men facing charges in Malawi for the. kidnapping of an 11-year-old Malawian girl in January, revealed he had been offered $6,500 for her body. It equates to 2,778,425 kwacha - a fortune in a country where the minimum wage is 551 a day. The recent surge in attacks has pushed the U.N. to speak out on the issue. 'These attacks are often stunningly vicious, with children. in particular being targeted,' said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the U.N.'s High Commissioner for. Human Rights. 'Many people with albinism are living in abject fear.' The U.N. called on regional governments to ensure the. criminals behind the attacks are prosecuted. 'They are maybe not doing enough to stop it,' the U.N.'s. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said. 'This is an incredibly vulnerable population in these. countries. 'And when you hear these kind of details of gangs of. men roaming around, literally hunting down people with albinism. simply to make money by cutting off their limbs and killing. them, you must question whether enough is being done.' 'Sadly what we see from the government are measures which react to this crisis in a surface level fashion. 'We call for a criminal investigation beyond the hired assailant or witchdoctor, and the gathering of thorough evidence on those involved at higher levels of this absurd trade.' So far, while few kdinappers and witchdoctors have ever been successfully tried for their role in the incidents, not one buyer has ever been prosecuted for their part in the albino trade. However, the government has announced a ban on witchdoctors - and last week, it was announced 32 had been arrested in the Geita region, the same area where Yohana was killed last month.

Durst, the focus of HBO's true crime documentary series \"The Jinx,\" was charged with first-degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante, Susan Berman. Now the FBI is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. \"They seem to be going to such great lengths to pin something else on him,\" DeGuerin said. \"They must not have much of a case to begin with.\" Durst, who authorities believe has a net worth of $100 million, has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states, according to court documents and public records. In \"The Jinx,\" Durst describes the time he spent living in Vermont with his first wife, Kathleen, running a health food store in the 1970s. In 1982, Kathleen McCormack Durst went missing. Durst says he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in Katonah, New York, and she headed to their Manhattan apartment. Her family members say they believe she's dead and that Durst is the one to blame. The case has never been solved. He's also lived in Galveston, Texas, where he admitted to shooting a neighbor and dismembering the body in 2001. He was acquitted in a 2003 murder trial after arguing he'd acted in self-defense. Last week, police searched condos Durst owns in Houston as part of the investigation into Berman's death. She was shot dead in December 2000 in her Beverly Hills, California, home. Investigators know Durst was in California the week Berman died. It's a detail Durst shrugs off in the HBO documentary,  in which he denied he had anything to do with Berman's death and said, \"California's a big state.\" Authorities investigating a decades-old cold case in Vermont said Monday that there's a connection between Durst and the case of Lynne Schulze, a college student who disappeared from Middlebury College in 1971. \"We are aware of the connection between the disappearance of Lynne Schulze and Robert Durst,\" Middlebury Police Capt. Tom Hanley said. \"We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead.\" Hanley elaborated Tuesday on the nature of the connection, saying Durst owned a health food store where Schulze shopped the day she disappeared. But there is no evidence the two had met, Hanley said. DeGuerin's attorney brushed off the accusation Monday. \"You know, he may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared,\" he said. \"He's an easy target.\" The name of the health food store, \"All Good Things,\" was also the title of a 2010 film starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the Durst case. After seeing the film, Durst reached out to director Andrew Jarecki and said he wanted to be interviewed. The interviews with Durst became the basis for \"The Jinx.\" Durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of Berman's death to Trinidad, California, a small coastal city in northern California. \"It was very rural, very pretty,\" he says. And it was a place, Durst says, where he lived \"off and on.\" In Eureka, about 20 miles south, Durst has been part of another investigation. Authorities there say they haven't ruled out the possibility he could be connected to the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who went missing in November 1997 when she was 16 years old. The police chief said investigators were interested in learning what Durst has to say about that case now that he's behind bars. \"We are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with Mr. Durst,\" Police Chief Andy Mills said. \"If information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation, then we will certainly take the opportunity to do that.\" According to local news reports at the time of Mitchell's disappearance, she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into. A witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel, which resulted in a sketch of a gray-haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist Matt Birkbeck says looks remarkably like Durst. \"He wears these wide-rim glasses. He was wearing those glasses back in the day and it's also in the composite,\" said"}

Instead, the unlikely two appear to become the best of friends, with the gentle tigress tenderly playing with it, before leaving the deer unharmed to live another day. Photographer Souvik said: 'When she slowly emerged from cover we were astonished to find she was playing with a hapless spotted deer fawn. 'The tigress seemed to be in a playful mood, jumping around in excitement.' The adorable encounter lasted for about 15 minutes, before the big cat retreated and allowed the small deer to rest in the grass. Photographer Souvik Kundu, 35, from Mumbai witnessed the tigress nuzzling the spotted deer fawn like one of her cubs. The joyful cat was seen jumping next to the deer, patting it and even carrying it in her mouth like a cub. The expectation among the crowd was that the feline would swiftly kill the deer and devour it. Souvik, 35, from Mumbai entitled photographs of the event, The Benevolent Queen, due to the tiger's gentle nature. He added: 'I'm still not sure why the tigress did not prey on the little deer when the chance presented and acted so unnaturally. 'One probable explanation is the tigress was in search for a mate and her urge for motherhood temporarily overcame predatory instinct. Play with me! The tigress instead just wants to play with the baby deer and kept patting it with its paws. Souvik said it was possible the tigress confused the fawn with her own offspring. 'As a result she had confused the fawn for her own offspring.' The Tadoba Andhari Reserve is the largest national park in Maharashtra, covering a total area of 241 square miles. The area was home to\u00a043 tigers when a census was conducted in 2010. The photographs form a series entitled, The Benevolent Queen, due to the tiger's gentle nature. The tiger left the deer resting in the grass, as the new friends went on with their days."}

But for one young coach who has already reached the promised land, it was the second tier of English football that provided his steepest learning curve. 'The Championship is really, really difficult!' Basle manager Paulo Sousa tells Sportsmail. 'Coaches who don't have that experience cannot realise how difficult it is. 'The standard of the players is more or less the same. It makes it very competitive right through the season. You can see in the way teams' positions change throughout the season, from the bottom and the top of the league. And the dreamland \u2013 the Premier League \u2013 is so, so close! Paulo Sousa\u00a0gestures during a press conference at the Dragao stadium ahead of facing Porto. Basle's Fabian Frei, Naser Aliji, Arlind Ajeti,  Breel Embolo, head coach Sousa, Adama Traore, Taulant Xhaka, Fabian Schaer and Behrang Safari train ahead of their Champions League clash at Porto. 'I learnt a lot in that league. There were some points where I was not prepared enough, but you gain experience by doing, not just watching or listening. 'It's like jumping into a swimming pool at the deep end. You can see how to do it from the side, but you will never learn unless you jump in.' And jump in is precisely what Sousa did seven years ago when he left the safety of the Portugal junior set-up to become the face of Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone's project at Queens Park Rangers. Taking the reins under a couple of Formula One moguls with a four-year plan to reach the top flight might seem like a daunting prospect for a debutant manager, but not for Sousa. 'Nothing is too soon. I will always be thankful to Briatore. All the difficulties I got through at that club and all the demands he made of me gave me the opportunity to grow. It was so demanding on a daily basis \u2013 24 hours every day from the first day I arrived there.' But what of Briatore's notorious habit of involving himself in managerial decisions? 'He tried. But I always fight for my convictions.' Basle manager Paulo Sousa says the Championship is a highly competitive league. Sousa's first job in club management was with Queens Park Rangers between 2008 and 2009. It is widely believed that these convictions - a refusal to act merely as Briatore's touchline proxy - are what saw Sousa ejected from the Loftus Road hotseat after just 26 games in charge. The two-time Champions League winner would get a second chance at Championship success just two months later though, taking over from Roberto Martinez at Swansea in June 2009. Under chairman Huw Jenkins, Sousa was given time to get his ideas across, and a subsequent seventh-placed finish \u2013 the club's highest for 27 years \u2013 showed it was time well spent. But the manager's progress hadn't gone unnoticed, and when moneybags Leicester came calling, Sousa couldn't resist. It quickly transpired that swapping the Mumbles for the Midlands was a mistake \u2013 Sousa was sacked after less than three months in charge \u2013 and the former Portugal international readily admits to a lapse of judgment in that summer of 2010. The Portuguese coach also had a spell in charge of Welsh side Swansea City between 2009 and 2010. As a player, Sousa won the Champions League with Juventus and Borussia Dortmund (pictured) During his playing career, Sousa also spent time with Greek giants Panathinaikos between 2000 and 2001. 'When I left Swansea, my ambition pushed me to take decisions in the direction of better infrastructures, better club history and higher prospects to reach the Premier League. 'Instead of seeing the whole forest, I saw only the beautiful tree in front of me. Swansea has lots of beautiful trees, but at that moment I didn't recognise that. That I regret.' That season, with Sousa clubless, Swansea were promoted to the Premier League under the guidance of Brendan Rodgers. Sousa insists it was not difficult to see his former club achieve what he narrowly missed out on the previous year. Instead he looked back fondly on his time there, though not everyone at the club regards the Sousa era with such nostalgia. Then captain and now manager Garry Monk has since released an outspoken autobiography in which he claimed Sousa's spell at the club had been a 'wasted season' and he was 'glad we didn't get into the play-offs as he did not deserve to be the one to take us to the Premiership'. These comments resonated with Sousa: 'Look, he's a person I want to succeed, like everyone. But unfortunately he said things about me and I don't appreciate people talking about somebody when they don't have the courage"}

Van der Garde was axed from his role as test driver at the end of last season as Sauber instead employed Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr, both of whom brought considerable sponsorship. Van der Garde, though, claimed to have proof he was offered a race seat for 2015 and so took his case initially to an arbitration panel in Switzerland which recently ordered Sauber 'to refrain from taking action' that would deny him a drive. Giedo van der Garde pictured outside the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Wednesday. There followed a hearing at the Supreme Court in Victoria, Australia, on Monday, with Mr Justice Croft announcing at 10am local time on Wednesday he found in favour of the 29-year-old Dutchman. Sauber immediately appealed, and by 3.15pm three different judges in Justices Simon Whelan, David Beach and Anne Ferguson heard the case. That lasted just 45 minutes, however, with the appeal to be reheard from 9.30am local time on Thursday, allowing them the opportunity to weigh up overnight the merits of the case. Notably there is the fact Ericsson and Nasr have contracts with the team for this year, and are expecting to be in the cockpit on Friday, with the first practice session due to commence at 12.30pm local time. Following the initial verdict, and prior to the appeal, team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was left stunned by the decision, but vowing to do what was right for her two current drivers. Van der Garde leaves the court after a judge ruled that Sauber must let the driver compete in Melbourne. Kaltenborn said: 'We are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season. 'What we cannot do is jeopardise the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers.' By contrast, Van der Garde was naturally happy to have won the initial decision, although faces an anxious wait to see if it will be upheld on appeal. 'I'm looking forward to going back to the team and we'll work hard to do our best for this weekend,' he said. Van der Garde driving for Sauber at the Italian Grand Prix last September. 'I'm the fittest ever. I've been training the last three months flat out. 'I still have a very good relation with the team, and I'm looking forward to racing this weekend.'

Bridgend council, which is now trying to track down the tarantula's owner, was alerted after the spider - which is not generally harmful to humans - was spotted by a passer-by at local Garth Park ball court. Local authority worker Dave Edwards scooped the arachnid up into a black bag before calling wildlife expert and TV personality Dr Rhys Jones, from Cardiff University, for advice. Dr Rhys Jones, from Cardiff University,\u00a0best known as the star of the BBC One Wales series Rhys Jones's Wildlife Patrol holds the lost tarantula, showing how safe it is. Dr Jones, best known as the star of the BBC One series Rhys Jones's Wildlife Patrol, said: 'It is unlikely that the spider would have travelled from distance, given the cold spring temperatures and the proximity of local houses. 'The surrounding habitat offered little interest or cover for that species of spider, given that it mainly consists of large open fields which are patrolled by many aerial predators, including gulls and crows. 'These birds would have easily spotted this tropical spider and, given half a chance, would have eaten her. 'All things considered, the spider had a very lucky escape before a bird or cat killed it.' The Mexican red rump, or B. vagans in Latin, was made famous in Jack Arnold's 1955 sci-fi movie Tarantula, where an ill-advised scientific experiment leads to a giant arachnid breaking out of captivity and terrorizing the Arizona desert. Luckily for the population of Bridgend County Borough, however, the creature is not aggressive, and is currently being looked after by Dr Jones at Cardiff University. 'The red rump tarantula does not present a significant health risk to the general public. In the rare case of the spider biting, the symptoms would be similar to that of a mild bee sting. 'I'm happy to report that no one was unnecessarily frightened by the appearance of this spider on the loose. 'While the spider is now secure and recovering from its ordeal, anyone with nformation relating to this incident should either contact the local authority or the police on 101.' Councillor Phil White, Cabinet Member for Communities, added: 'It's not every day that you spot an exotic pet such as this outside of its home environment, so we are appealing for the owner to get in touch as soon as possible.

The cards are intended for expenses including travel, office supplies and catering. But thousands of pounds were spent on fast food, iTunes and shopping trips abroad last year.

While this may seem as fanciful now as it did then, 2015 does looks set to be the year of so-called \u2018wearable technology\u2019, clothing and accessories that could transform not only our wardrobes, but our health, too. Until now, wearable technology has largely taken the form of wristband trackers \u2014 such as the Fitbit (launched in 2008), 2011\u2019s Jawbone and the much-hyped Apple Watch, due to go on sale on April 24. But now, manufacturers are developing everyday items of clothing and shoes that can monitor our vital signs, and even treat serious conditions. The latest innovations include a bra that could deliver life-saving breast cancer medication and socks that warn if you\u2019re at risk of injury. Hi-tech: A bra contains technology which allows tiny \u2018nano\u2019 particles of a substance - for instance, a drug - to be embedded into a material. Even big brands are moving into the market \u2014 this year, the U.S. designer Ralph Lauren will launch a sports top that monitors heart rate, muscle movement and calories burnt. \u2018So far, wearable technology in the context of well-being has been mainly about monitoring personal data,\u2019 says Caroline Till, course leader in Material Futures at Central St Martins, University of the Arts London. \u2018The question now is what do you do with the data once you have it? Is the information of value?\u2019 This is where the latest technology comes in, with the focus on giving you feedback from the information collated. So in theory, \u2018wearables\u2019, as they\u2019re known, will not only take your blood pressure reading, they\u2019ll tell you if it\u2019s dangerously high. \u2018The holy grail of wearable technology is something that\u2019s integrated seamlessly into something you wear or use already, so you don\u2019t notice it\u2019s there,\u2019 says Caroline Till. This is now closer to being a reality because circuitry can be made small and light enough to be embedded in clothing. Another material technology, known as micro-encapsulation, allows tiny \u2018nano\u2019 particles of a substance \u2014 for instance, a drug \u2014 to be embedded into a material so it is gradually absorbed through the skin when worn. Here, we look at the latest \u2018wearables\u2019\u2014 some of which are already available, with others still being developed \u2014 that could transform our health... The Omsignal top has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing. BRA THAT DELIVERS CANCER DRUGS. The Foxleaf bra contains micro-encapsulated \u2018bubbles\u2019 of the drug Tamoxifen in soft, plastic inserts in the cups. The idea is that the body\u2019s heat and moisture rub off the bubbles\u2019 coating and the Tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen to slow the growth of cancer cells, can be gradually absorbed through the skin throughout the day. The bra was developed by Sarah Da Costa, a Masters student at Central St Martins, London. It aims to provide a possible solution for thousands of women who find the side-effects of Tamoxifen intolerable. Delivering the drug locally means less has to be processed by the liver, potentially reducing side-effects such as hot flushes, cramps and nausea. There are now plans to run clinical trials to work out at what rate the drug would be absorbed. Da Costa\u2019s next project is to see whether similar technology could be used to deliver dementia drug galantamine via bedding or nightwear. VEST TO HELP YOU BURN OFF CALORIES. NASA scientist Dr Wayne B Hayes has invented the Cold Shoulder vest, which he says boosts your body\u2019s ability to burn calories. The vest, which can be kept in the freezer, has pockets for ice packs around the back and shoulders. The idea is that by wearing the vest your body has to burn more calories to stay warm \u2014 as much as an extra 500 calories a day, says Dr Hayes.

The sensors can also monitor the electrical activity of the heart. Fibres feed this information to a \u2018black box\u2019 \u2014 about the size of a credit card \u2014 attached to the shirt.

A married mother-of-five was stabbed to death in a field as she tended to her horses because the son of her former partner paid to have her'silenced', a court heard today. Ben Carr, 22, had 'lasting hate and anger' towards Pennie Davis because she had repeatedly accused him of historical sexual offences, it was claimed. Mrs Davis, 47, who worked at a supermarket, was found dead by her husband on September 2 in a field at Leygreen Farm, Beaulieu, Hampshire. Justin Robertson, 36, of no fixed address, who denies murder and conspiracy to murder, was traced by police after he dropped a set of car keys at the murder scene, Winchester Crown Court was told. Benjamin Carr, 22, of Edward Road, Southampton, and Samantha Maclean, 28, of Beech Crescent, Hythe, are also charged with conspiracy to murder, which they deny. Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, said: 'Penelope Davis went to tend her horses in a field at a farm near Beaulieu on the edge of the New Forest. 'Whilst there and alone in a small paddock within the horse field, she was attacked and repeatedly stabbed by the defendant, Justin Robertson. 'Penelope's body was found later that same afternoon lying in the field by her husband, Peter Davis, who had left work and come to give her a hand with the horses. 'They had only been married for a matter of months.' He continued: 'The defendant, Justin Robertson, had agreed to kill Penelope Davis for money. He had agreed to kill her for the defendant Ben Carr. It was he, Ben Carr, who had the plan, Robertson and Carr carried out that plan to kill Penelope Davis with the help of their fellow defendant Samantha Maclean.' Mr Smith said Carr had wanted Mrs Davis'silenced' because he believed she would make an allegation to police that he had indecently assaulted someone, a complaint she had previously made. He said: 'Why would Ben Carr want Penelope Davis killed? The answer to that question, which will remain at the heart of this trial, probably lies in the fact that Ben Carr believed that Mrs Davis was going to go to the police, as she had done before, and allege that he had previously indecently assaulted (someone). 'It was for that reason, principally it seems, that Ben Carr wanted Penelope Davis silenced, so he recruited others to help him.' Mr Smith said Mrs Davis knew Carr because she had been in a relationship with his father Timothy from about 2006 to 2012. He said Ben Carr had a 'lasting hate and anger' towards Mrs Davis after she made a complaint to police about the allegations of sexual assault against him when he was 14. A member of the police forensic team works at the scene of Mrs Davis' death at Leygreen Farm in the days following her death. Mr Smith said police took no further action on the complaint and added that Carr'strenuously and consistently' denied the allegations. He said: 'The accusations left Ben Carr with a lasting sense of animosity, hatred, towards Pennie Davis. It didn't, say the Crown, wear off.' When Timothy Carr was about to marry his new love Alison Macintyre in August last year, Mrs Davis - described as a 'forthright and emotional lady' - sent messages to his new wife-to-be on Facebook at 2.20am on August 20. In it, she repeated the historical sexual allegations against Carr which she had first made back in 2006. The messages were then shown to Ben Carr and he came to learn the'strength of feeling' Mrs Davis was expressing against him and the threat that she was to return to the police with the allegations. Mr Smith said Mrs Davis repeated the allegations against Carr in August last year after she found out that Timothy Carr was to marry his new partner, Alison Macintyre. He said Mrs Davis sent Facebook messages to Ms Macintyre saying one of the alleged victims of Carr would be making a statement to police. Mrs Davis wrote in one message: 'Good luck, you will need it,' and in another: 'I can't forgive him, all the shit he gave me, I f****** hate him and all his family.' Pennie Davis (pictured) was tending to her horses in the New Forest when she was killed, it is alleged. Mr Smith said: 'It was not just spoiling the new family that was starting with the imminent marriage, it was much more than that, she was trying to do something specifically to harm him, to throw his life in utter turmoil with the allegations that he says were falsely made against him. 'The truth of those allegations matter not a jot. When you are simply accused of something like that it touches, in the most difficult way, all parts of your life.

A man may lose his leg after he was attacked by a wild panda as it was chased by locals after it wandered into a village in China. Guan Quanzhi was set upon by the panda, which sunk its teeth into his leg, as officials chased it into his land in Liziba village near Longnan City in Gansu Province. A quick thinking villager threw a coat over the animal's head which made it let go of Mr Quanzhi who was left severely injured. He had to have a seven hour operation to try and repair the damage. In the last year Mr Quanzhi has spent months in hospital and had a total of eight operations. He has recently been told he may have to have his leg amputated, according to the People's Daily online. 'When the giant panda sunk its teeth into my leg the pain was indescribable. Blood was everywhere,' said Mr Quanzhi. Pandas have a 'cuddly' reputation but can be territorial. They have strong jaws which enable them to strip bamboo but this also means they can deliver a powerful bite. The incident took place on March 1 last year when the panda wandered into\u00a0a village near Longnan City in Gansu Province. Locals attempted to capture the animal only for it to flee them and run into Mr Quanzhi's land. Mr Quanzhi, who is in his 60s, added: 'I was working at home and saw many people running in my direction, looking closer I could see a mud-covered panda being chased.' As the animal saw Mr Quanzhi was blocking its path he sunk its teeth into its leg until someone threw a coat over it. The panda fled and disappeared after being seen wandering around in the mountains for more than half an hour. Locals realised Mr Quanzhi was seriously injured and he was taken to\u00a0Qingchuan County People's hospital, which was more than 10km away, for emergency treatment. The next day Mr Quanzhi had to endure a seven hour operation to repair the broken bone in his leg and stem a ruptured vein. He was in hospital for two months. Because of his family's financial circumstances\u00a0the village council and the Forestry Bureau  borrowed 70,000 yuan (\u00a37,500) and 30,000 yuan (\u00a33,000) respectively. The panda was seen roaming around the village and attacked Mr Quanzi, sinking its teeth into his leg. The panda, normally a docile animal, was chased and is believed to have panicked when it bit Mr Quanzi. Officials had been chasing the panda after they realised the wild animal was roaming around the village. Mr Quanzi has been forced to endure eight operations and weeks in hospital since he was bitten by the panda. His son said: 'My father stayed in hospital for 57 days, during this time he had skin grafts as well as various operations. 'After so much suffering and over such a long period of time part of his leg muscles have slowly shrunk and this has led to him not being able to walk on his leg and no longer being able to look after himself.' Mr Quanzhi was told that because his recovery has been unsatisfactory he is likely to need further surgery and may need to have his leg amputated. He took the Provincial Forestry Department, Longnan City's County Forestry Bureau and the Whitewater River National Nature Reserve Administration, home to around 100 wild pandas, to court. The animal had wandered into the village and is believed to have been looking for food when it was spotted. Experts have warned that while pandas have a 'cute and cuddly' reputation they do have strong jaws. The panda (centre) was seen wandering around Liziba Village and was spotted by locals who reported it. He was recently awarded 520,000 yuan (\u00a356,000) in compensation from the three parties. 'Although giant panda's are generally docile, they are still wild animals, and are territorial,'\u00a0Director of the Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre of China, Zhang Hemin. 'Pandas rarely ever attack people, but if people enter their territory they will attack in self-defense as a warning.' The animals are an important draw for tourists in China, and several are rented out to zoos. They have also been known to attack people in the past. In 2008 a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who scaled a 6ft tall barrier to climb into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. The panda was apparently scared by the intruder and bit the man on his arms and legs."}

According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 Assyrians captured on February 23 during an attack on villages in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander. The reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear. It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. When the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released, Graeme Wood, with The Atlantic, said he was pleased to hear about it, but not entirely surprised. \"ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,\" he told CNN. \"They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law.\" Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September. Samira Said reported from Abu Dhabi. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Melissa Gray also contributed to this report."}

According to Czr\u2019s Facebook page, the dog has been taught to communicate with classic learning theory. Its ability to say 'yes' and 'no' as well as nod and shake its head is what sets it apart from others like it.

Working out that the dog wants to play, the owner rattles off a handful of options and the dog waits patiently until she guesses the right one. After asking the Czr if he plants to play with his sister, Via (short for Octavia), he answers with a nod. The conversation then begins to tail off with the woman asking a number of questions and the dog offering a bewildered look. The owner asks Czr whether he would like a treat, and immediately the dog answers with a nod and convincing 'yes'. No! Czr  shakes his head when his owner asks him whether he would like something.

Additionally, the committee has subpoenaed the emails of close to a dozen people who worked in the State Department for Clinton. Finally, pressure is mounting on the Clinton Foundation due to its acceptance of large contributions from foreign governments while Clinton was Secretary of State.", "article": "A Republican-led congressional committee created to look into the 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attacks has formally asked Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton to deliver her now-famous secret email server to a neutral third party for examination. The same committee has already subpoenaed the emails of 'close to a dozen' people who worked in the State Department for Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, the chairman of the U.S. House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said on Thursday. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman, wrote to Clinton's lawyer to say he expects her to give the email server to the State Department's inspector general or another unbiased examiner for an independent determination of which emails and other records should be in the public domain \u2013 or at least archived by the government. He gave Clinton an April 3 deadline to make a decision, saying he would urge House Speaker John Boehner to take action if she ignores his request. 'Though Secretary Clinton alone is responsible for causing this issue, she alone does not get to determine its outcome,' Gowdy said in a statement. 'That is why in the interest of transparency for the American people, I am formally requesting she turn the server over.' HAND IT OVER: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy asked Hillary Clinton's lawyer on Friday to hand over her email server to a neutral third party for analysis. NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD: Mrs. Clinton dodged talk of her presidential ambitions on Thursday but a speech organizer gave her a 'Camp David' sweatshirt anyway. 'An independent analysis of the private server Secretary Clinton used for the official conduct of U.S. government business is the best way to remove politics and personal consideration from the equation. Having a neutral, third-party arbiter such as the State Department IG do a forensic analysis and document review is an eminently fair and reasonable means to determine what should be made public.' Gowdy's committee has authority to subpoena documents and individual witnesses, but not pieces of computer hardware. That would require a criminal search warrant signed by a federal judge, and Clinton is not thought to be under investigation for any crime. The hard-charging former prosecutor had told Reuters earlier on Friday that aides to Clinton and perhaps 'aides to aides' would find themselves subpoenaed. 'We sent a subpoena to the State Department for emails from a number of individuals within the State Department, other than Secretary Clinton,' Gowdy, a Republican, said in a phone interview with the news service. Separately, pressure mounted Friday on the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with a new wrinkle in the flap over the nationality of many of its six- and seven-figure donors \u2013 many of whom, it has been revealed, have ties to foreign governments. Former President Bill Clinton had promised the Obama administration that his family philanthropy would turn down money from foreign governments themselves while his wife was secretary of state. But a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0investigation has established that it willingly accepted large contributions from more than a dozen foundations and companies and people who might be surrogates for overseas regimes. They included a member of the Saudi royal family, a 'Ukrainian oligarch' who once served in the nation's parliament, and many government-linked businessmen, according to the Journal. Overall, the twelve gave between $34 million and $68 million after Hillary took over the State Department. Exact numbers can't be gleaned from available documents \u2013 only ranges. The Ukrainian could be problematid for Mrs. Clinton because it involves millions from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, run by a businessman who has been a strong advocate of his country establishing closer ties with the European Union. Pinchuk also served two terms in Ukraine's parliament. Much of his foundation's donated funds came to the Clinton Foundation while the State Department was pushing for Europe, and against Russia, as a dominant force in Ukraine. It's unclear whether the foundation flap or 'email-gate' will prove the greater irritant to Mrs. Clinton's growing presidential campaign momentum. But a New York Times report this month that she had exclusively used a personal email account for government business while the chief U.S. diplomat from 2009 to 2013 has reinvigorated the Benghazi committee's investigation into the attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Clinton is the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination even though she has yet to formally declare her candidacy. She has come under scrutiny from Republicans who accuse her State Department of failing to protect diplomatic personnel. Gowdy said the State Department had asked him not to disclose the names of people whose emails were sought. Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, insists he's not interested in Clinton's private communications, but wants to elarn if she discussed the 2012 Benghazi terror attack outside the reach of government document-retention mandates. EMAIL-GATE: Clinton has been dogged by accusations that she hid work-related emails from the State Department by relying exclusively on a private email server hosted in her home. But without their emails, he has argued,"}

She had already secured permission last year to be known under the name 'Chelsea' instead of 'Bradley'. Chelsea Manning, pictured here (center) in 2013 before she began her transition, was known as Bradley when she went on trial for the massive document leak  to the WikiLeaks website. Chelsea, 27, pictured here in a wig and lipstick in an undated photograph, is allowed to wear women's underwear, undergo psychotherapy, and has had hormone therapy for gender reassignment approved. The former intelligence analyst had also been allowed to wear women's underwear following a decision last year, and to undergo psychotherapy. The latest move comes a month after the U.S. Army approved hormone therapy for Manning's gender reassignment - a first for the American military. 'All future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral, e.g. Private First Class Manning or appellant, or employ a feminine pronoun' said a court order on Wednesday. Manning, pictured on stickers worn by a  demonstrator, has now won the right to be addressed in gender-neutral or feminine terms in court. However 'in respect to historic fact,' the court will retain masculine wordage used in previous decisions, including Manning's conviction. The news has been welcomed by Manning's defense team. 'The court rightly recognized that dignifying Chelsea's womanhood is not the trivial matter that the government attempted to frame it as,' said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in Manning's defense.

He was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'. De La Cruz was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation.

He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'. They then drove to Cactus Park and disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states. On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. She described'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. The housekeeper added that it smelled 'as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states. Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail for investigation of drug-related charges. Myers  had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine and police initially believed she had fled Colorado for Utah. Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. A search team was not sent out for the teenager until January 19. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time. Myers went missing December 18, when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah."}

Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30,\u00a0of Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, admitted four counts of theft after stealing from St Wilfrid's Church's - but claimed the amount he had taken was closer to \u00a315,000. Yesterday he was branded 'unchristian' for leaving the Newcastle church on the brink of closure after stealing the money and blowing it on gambling. Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox also failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and\u00a0even left it potentially uninsured. The court heard Conway-Wilcox became treasurer at St Wilfrid's in May\u00a02013 and was responsible for making sure money was put in the bank and invoices were\u00a0paid. After receiving complaints about unpaid bills Reverend Sarah Miller initially gave\u00a0Conway-Wilcox the benefit of the doubt. But matters came to a head in May last year when Ecclesiastical Insurance\u00a0rang up and told her they had not been paid and that the church and its contents\u00a0were potentially uninsured. An investigation began and it was discovered Conway-Wilcox had transferred\u00a0\u00a310,098 from the church's refurbishment account into his own between\u00a0November 2013 and May 2014. A further \u00a3550 had been moved from church bank accounts to his account and Conway-Wilcox failed to bank more than \u00a310,000 in cheques. Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told the court the total amount misappropriated was \u00a320,856.78. The church has since been paid back \u00a310,000 by the insurance company. St Wilfrid's Church in\u00a0Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, was left in danger of closure after Conway-Wilcox failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured. Paul Caulfield, defending, told the court: 'He had a horrendous gambling problem, referred himself for help and has attended 20 sessions. 'Since this matter came to light he has not been involved in gambling. 'He is mortified by his conduct and apologises publicly, having apologised\u00a0privately previously.' Recorder Nicholas\u00a0Lumley QC told Conway-Wilcox: 'This church serves one of this great city's less\u00a0fortunate areas and it has a small but committed congregation. 'The church, its fabric and its good work was placed in jeopardy by you. 'And why? Well, because of your greed. You saw them as a soft target and a\u00a0ready source of cash for your own frailties and you plundered what money\u00a0they had. 'You took advantage of your position of trust by stealing from various bank\u00a0accounts and when it was queried you stalled, prevaricated and lied. 'Not only is it unchristian it is thoroughly dishonest.' Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox left the Newcastle church on the brink of closure. Martin Sheppard, of the Diocese of\u00a0Newcastle, said: 'It's been a very sad story for Martin, for his family and the church family at Newbiggin Hall. It's been a very difficult time for the congregation. 'We don't understand why he did what he did. Everyone feels great sorrow and regret. 'As I understand it, the money that was taken was money that people had been collecting for the renovation work for a church hall facility in the Newbiggin Hall area. 'The money was collected by faithful members of the church and now they have been set back in their project to serve the community where they live,work and worship.' Conway-Wilcox was handed an eight month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay \u00a35,000 compensation to St Wilfrid's."}

Gabby Agbonlahor, cry Aston Villa fans to the tune of Karma Chameleon, is rather fast. That\u2019s the clean version. The frequency with which the words are heard from now until the end of the season will prove largely correlative to Villa\u2019s chances of remaining a Premier League team. They have not been sounded all too often this campaign. But at Villa Park on Tuesday night, especially during the first half, Agbonlahor produced a performance to warrant adulation. Gabby Agbonlahor salutes the Villa Park crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against West Brom. Agbonlahor threads the ball through Ben Foster's legs to give the hosts the lead in the Midlands derby. It was arguably his best display in years, a return to those days when his speed and strength shot him into the England set-up. Agbonlahor consistently harried Gareth McAuley and Joleon Lescott, chasing down balls he had no obligation to reach, using his stocky physique to keep hold of possession when under threat. Christian Benteke got the headlines for his late winning goal, but it was Agbonlahor who set the tone. His goal was a classic case of pace proving the difference. He latched onto Benteke\u2019s nodded flick and finished while making statues of the West Bromwich Albion central defenders. He did similar when creating a pass out Ashley Westwood\u2019s hopeful ball, sprinting to startle the opposition backline and only being denied a second by Lescott\u2019s goalline clearance. Boy George\u2019s ditty rang loud. Agbonlahor beat Foster again shortly after but Joleon Lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line. Agbonlahor reacts after West Brom keeper Foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line. Foster initially caught the shot from Agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly. In all, he had three shots on target \u2013 including the badly fumbled effort by Ben Foster than nearly trickled over the line \u2013 which is a significant uplift of recent matches. In this statistic, the sequence of his last 12 games reads: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. Fantastic figures should Jimmy Anderson be bowling a couple of overs at the death in the World Cup. As shots on target for a Premier League striker? Not so much. Agbonlahor failed to test the goalkeepers of Newcastle, Chelsea, Arsenal (admittedly as a substitute), Liverpool, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Manchester United (albeit sent off unjustly after 65 minutes) and West Bromwich Albion. His inability in that period to make a difference in opponents\u2019 penalty areas is symptomatic of Villa\u2019s wider attacking paralysis, stymied by a style that ranked possession over purpose to an adverse extent. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after Agbonlahor's goal. Christian Benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for Aston Villa. It is hard as a centre-forward to strike for goal if the ball is rarely within 30 yards of the target. Agbonlahor would often operate on the wings under Paul Lambert too. This is not to absolve the 28-year-old. As one of the club\u2019s senior figures his form has been disappointing, particularly since he signed a new four-year contract last September. Born locally and graduating from Villa\u2019s youth set up he is a supporter of the club and the depth of his feeling has been clear in his commitment since he broke through to the first team nine years ago. So it has been odd to see his on-field demeanour at certain times this season, exhibiting none of the vim Villa fans know well. Benteke celebrates his goal with Aston Villa team-mates Jack Grealish and Andreas Weimann. Brad Guzan looked on in horror as Saido Berahino equalised for the visitors before Benteke's winner. That was back with a bang against West Brom. Tim Sherwood restored Agbonlahor up front alongside Benteke and allowed for the direct style that suits their attributes. Agbonlahor found the net for the first time in 14 matches and it proved valuable. Each one of his four Premier League goals has counted for something: a draw against Southampton and wins against Liverpool and Hull, accompanying the West Brom victory. Seven extra points in total. Sherwood knows the worth of the player whose speed is celebrated in chant. The Villa manager needs to continue utilising his talents for the final 10 Premier League matches to make sure this spark of brilliance does not fizzle out. Agbonlahor on song means Villa should stay up."}

Mr Scurfield's father (centre) and uncle (left) turned out for the ceremony, which saw hundreds of Syrian Kurds line the streets and wave brightly-coloured flags as the coffin was handed over to the family. Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria. Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags. The former Royal Marine, described as a 'one-man army' who was'very angry about the Middle East', was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself \u2013 dressed in army fatigues \u2013 in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. A\u00a0Kurdish women stands beside the body of Mr Scurfield and pays her respects. It is not known when his body will be returned to his hometown in South Yorkshire and the Foreign Office has been unable to confirm. Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried into an ambulance by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay respect. Mr Scurfield's coffin, which was draped in both the Union Jack and Kurdish flags, was taken to Erbil in Iraq. Mr Scurfield's body was taken to the Syrian-Iraqi border by car before being handed over to his family. Mr Scurfield described yesterday's ceremony as 'overwhelming' and said it was'very special and very comforting' to his family. His son's coffin was draped with the Kurdish and Union Flags and hundreds of people, including Kurdish fighters in the region, watched as it was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang \u2018alarm bells\u2019, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. At one point during the procession, a woman dressed in a headscarf offered Mr Scurfield's devastated father support, by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head. According to the Kurdish Female Fighters page on Facebook, those who gathered at the ceremony chanted \u2018slogans of heroism\u2019 as Mr Scurfield\u2019s body was handed back to his family.

Fashion store Karen Millen has come under fire for featuring a mannequin in their shop that appeared to be seriously underweight. Laura Evans, from Hampshire, tweeted a picture of one of the plastic models which featured ribs clearly protruding from the chest. She wrote: 'Karen Millen, why've you chosen to make collar bones & ribs so central to the marketing of this dress? Dangerous!' The medic's picture was quickly picked up by outraged women on the social media site, who called for the mannequin to be removed from the stores. One user called @WitchBrain wrote: 'Ewwww! I buy Karen Millen quite often, but I DO NOT want to look like this! What on earth is this about?' Another called \u200f@JoLiptrott\u00a0said: Shame on @KarenMillen for this normalising of the super-skinny. What a terrible message to send to our young women.' Women weren't the only ones disgusted by the mannequin's skinny frame though - men also voiced their distaste. A user called \u200f@seanmurphy2711 wrote: 'Almost beyond belief. Someone has made conscious decision to do that.' A spokesperson for the British eating disorder charity BEAT said: 'It\u2019s very concerning that well respected and influential high street fashion retailers persist in using obviously underweight mannequins. 'Unhelpful in fuelling the continuous exposure of thinness as the \u2018ideal\u2019, retailers should consider very seriously the messages that they put across and we should all play a part in giving a generation of young people confidence in their bodies, their appearance and their sense of wellbeing.' The spokesperson continued: 'People who are at risk, or already affected by an eating disorder can be triggered or maintained in the disorder by the images they see everywhere. 'The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation are to grow up with a robust sense of their self worth.' Laura Evans posted the picture of the mannequin on Twitter along with a photo of the dress on the runway. Twitter users were quick to voice their disgust at the pictures. Karen Millen has responded to the criticism on the social media site, with a spokesperson saying: 'As a brand we celebrate a range of body sizes within collections and offer size 6 through to 16. 'Both the mannequin and model you have seen representing Karen Millen are size 10 which is industry standard. 'No offence was meant and the intention is not to advertise a negative body image but to focus on the style of the garment in both instances. 'We are so sorry for any disappointment and upset this may have caused.' The model who wore the dress on the catwalk also had a very slender frame. The furore comes just a few weeks after the high street store Whistles were criticised for featuring a super skinny mannequin in one of their stores. With a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms, this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store Whistles. The shocking picture was taken by a passer-by of a window display of the brand's Angel store in London. It shows the thin-looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top. In response to the photograph below, which was taken in February, eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards. Snapped: This is the shocking photo of a mannequin that was spotted in the Whistles store in Angel, London. Mary George from Beat, the UK's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders, said: 'It is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street. 'This stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry doesn't directly cause eating disorders- it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people. 'We call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive, life enhancing ways. Fashion can be fantastic- creative, aspirational and fun. 'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people's different shapes and sizes, heights, widths and build.' Amina Hays, who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in Upper Street brand of Whistles, said she found it'revolting'.

Sarah Marquis claims she was'rendered infertile' by doctors at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, after her appendix burst in 2008. The 41-year-old lawyer is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for \u00a31.5million in the belief that it is to blame for her infertility. Sarah Marquis, 41, is suing Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust after a botched operation left her infertile. But while the trust admits causing her injuries, it claims it does not owe her so much money in compensation as if she had been able to give birth she would not be earning as much. Instead it believes she is entitled to \u00a3300,000, with lawyers acting on its behalf telling the High Court that Ms Marquis's career would have been hampered if she'd ever given birth. The Court heard how the woman was admitted to hospital in 2008 after complaining of abdominal pains at her GP. She was treated with painkillers for three days before surgeons decided to remove the inflamed organ. But by the time they got round to operating, Ms Marquis's appendix had burst and an abdominal infection had set in. As a result she lost her ability to have children naturally. Describing the hospital's role in her ordeal, Ms Marquis's counsel Cara Guthrie said: 'Had it not been for the negligence of the defendants, Ms Marquis\u2019 appendix would not have perforated. 'She would have made a rapid and uncomplicated recovery, avoiding an extended hospital stay, and she would not have been rendered infertile.' As a result of the botched operation Ms Marquis had to take time off from her \u00a385,000 a year job and missed out on promotions abroad, she added. While the Trust's barrister admitted it was to blame for the complications, he denied her claim that she was entitled to \u00a31.5million. The 41-year-old lawyer was treated at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London, )pictured above) in 2008. Lawyers acting on behalf of the trust said Ms Marquis, who is also a Labour councillor, would not have been earning as much money if she had a baby. The hearing at the High Court (above) continues. He argued that rather than move up the career ladder her earnings would have slowed down as a result of giving birth. 'The Trust acknowledges the fault on its part that caused your injuries and it is sorry for that,' said Bradley Martin. '(But) the possibilities are that you would have got pregnant naturally in the six months you and your partner decided to really try for a baby after the negligence. Speaking of her long term partner who she began living with shortly after the surgery he added: 'You moved in together in order to have a baby.' He rejected her earlier claim that had it not been for the operation she would have been selected to work in the company's American offices as he said she would have been pregnant. Ms Marquis rejected his accusations. The 41-year-old had undergone IVF treatment in the past to become pregnant. 'If that was my only time to have a child then I would have done so...(but) I do value my career at the same time. 'I wanted to get my life back to normal. I had been off work effectively for three and a half years.' The hearing continues."}

Alonso's relationship with McLaren is still strained from his time with the team in 2007, and he was surrounded by his own cabal of advisors during his media briefing in Sepang.", "article": "Bump on the head or not, Fernando Alonso is the same wily maverick he always was. This most brilliant yet political of drivers, who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun \u2018I\u2019, delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly, courteously and devastatingly. A steering problem, he told a press conference before Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, was the cause of the McLaren driver\u2019s apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in Barcelona last month. Just one thing: McLaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car. Calling on every conceivable bit of tele-metry, they compiled a 37-page report, which they presented to the FIA, substantiating that view. Fernando Alonso stands in front of the world's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of Sunday's race. The Spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona. \u2018The steering problem came in the middle of turn three,\u2019 elaborated Alonso, who missed the opening race in Melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career. \u2018It locked into the right and when I approached the wall I braked at the last moment, I downshifted from fifth to third, and unfortunately we are still missing some data.\u2019 How routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers, including a host of former drivers. \u2018I\u2019ve listened to Alonso\u2019s very clear explanation of the incident,\u2019 said broadcaster Martin Brundle, who drove in 158 grands prix. \u2018Now I\u2019m really confused.\u2019 One of the FIA\u2019s most senior technical officials commended McLaren\u2019s report as honest and robust. Why, then, would the Spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence? Alonso is set for his second McLaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign. The Spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in Sepang after being declared fit to race. The two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error, or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall (even though he was changing gears, he may have been semi-conscious as he did so). It appears he did not mention any steering problem to McLaren until last week - three weeks after the accident. They then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on Monday, perhaps to appease him. What they did not expect was Alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the Sepang paddock. That left McLaren snookered. They could not disregard their meticulous data, nor could they publicly argue with their \u00a325million-a-year driver - relations between the team and Alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at McLaren in 2007. Alonso barely speaks to Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. His relationship with the de facto team principal Eric Boullier, who was not at McLaren during Alonso\u2019s first spell there, is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to Andrea Stella, an Italian who moved with him from Ferrari to remain his race engineer. These scenes echoed 2007, when Alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about Dennis to the FIA during the Spygate scandal. Alonso arrives in the Sepang paddock for the Malaysian Grand Prix; the second round of the championship. The double world champion in the paddock with compatriot Carlos Sainz prior to Thursday's media briefing. Back then, the team were split in two. Alonso and his manager Luis Garcia Abad would brief Spanish journalists in one corner. The same procedure happened at the team\u2019s hospitality area here on Thursday. Alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - Abad and his deputy Alberto Fernandez, and physiotherapist Edoardo Bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so-called \u2018boys\u2019 lunch\u2019... the meal provided for the team\u2019s mechanics and engineers. By this point, Alonso, who arrived at the track at 9.45am, had been cleared by the FIA\u2019s doctors to compete on Sunday, a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three Cambridge University doctors at the weekend. Yet still the mystery goes on. Alonso said he was \u2018perfectly conscious at the time\u2019 of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with McLaren\u2019s public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene. Alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on Friday.

The Coast Guard is cutting ice on the Hudson River to allow for petroleum deliveries and for commuter ferries and fishing vessels to traverse the waterways.

Scott Werner of Portland, Maine, said this winter has been 'a horror show' for lobster fishermen like himself. The ice has prevented him from getting his boat out to fish in recent weeks, and cut into his ability to make money in the already slow winter lobstering season, he said. 'I'm not going to risk it. I don't want to break anything,' Werner said. 'It's been brutal, but what are you going to do?' Scroll down for video. New lows: Portland Harbor in Maine is encountering more ice than ever thanks to the coldest February on record - several lobster boats were locked in the ice and ice breakers are needed to keep commerce flowing. Iced waterways are a problem in other Northeast locations, such as off of Boston, where a commuter ferry carrying more than 100 passengers got delayed by about 45 minutes when it was slowed down by the coastal ice pack on February 20. And in New York, where the Coast Guard is cutting ice on the Hudson River so barges carrying heating oil, gasoline and jet fuel can reach destinations. The thickest part is in the area of Germantown and Hudson, north of New York City. In some spots the ice is a foot-and-a-half thick, Coast Guard officials said. 'The barges traveling from New York City to Albany have the most difficult time transiting through that one area, so that's where the Coast Guard is devoting its effort to keep clean,' Coast Guard Lt. Ken Sauerbrunn said. Landlocked: Lobster fishing boats are locked in ice at Widgery Wharf in Portland, Maine. It was the coldest February on record in Portland according to National Weather Service records that go back to 1940. The frigid temperatures froze more than ten lobster fishing boats in ice off of Portland, said Bill Needelman, the city's waterfront coordinator. Fewer fishermen have been able to pursue key food fish such as haddock and pollock, which has cut into landings at the city's fish pier and lessened activity at the Portland Fish Exchange auction, he said. The ice also is causing damage to piers and could contribute to erosion, Needelman said. Freezing conditions: A lobsterman looks out at the icy waters while checking on the condition of his boat in Portland, Maine - Ice clings to pilings at the high-tide mark in the background. He said this year's ice likely will take a heavy toll on waterfront infrastructure in the city. 'It's a highly destructive force and we can anticipate that there will be a lot of maintenance needs and repair needs,' he said. The Coast Guard experienced an approximately two week period in February when it's ice-cutting tug, Shackle, was out cutting ice every day, Chief Warrant Officer Bob Albert said. Cutting was needed in Portland Harbor, the Fore River and parts of Casco Bay to allow for petroleum deliveries and for commuter ferries and fishing vessels to traverse the waterways, he said. 'The demand for ice breaking this year has exceeded any demands that have been placed on the Coast Guard at any time in the last ten years,' Albert said."}

Passengers said the pilot and first officer were unable to breathe without the masks as halon - a liquefied, compressed gas - filled the confined space as the plane flew from London Stansted Airport to Valencia. TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White said that passengers suspected there was a serious problem, but they did not know the reason for the emergency landing until they arrived at Barcelona-El Prat Airport. Ryanair flight FR8321 was met by fire trucks when it landed at\u00a0Barcelona-El Prat Airport. Hannah spoke to told MailOnline Travel as she and other passengers sat on the plane while the pilot and co-pilot were checked over by medical staff. She said: \u2018One of the fire extinguishers in the cockpit went off and it\u2019s got halon gas, which is very dangerous, and as a result the pilot and first officer couldn\u2019t breathe.' Ryanair described it as a minor fault involving a fire extinguisher and said the flight crew followed standard procedure by putting on their masks. Hannah added: \u2018The oxygen masks deployed [for the flight crew] and we dropped down to a very low altitude. \u2018When [the pilot] came over the tannoy to talk to us you could hear them breathing through the oxygen masks. Passengers said they were unaware of the reason for the emergency landing but knew it was serious. TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White tweeted a photo of fire trucks on the tarmac. \u2018The first thing we heard was \u201cemergency landing\u201d, said three times by the captain, which indicates a massive issue.\u2019 Hannah said the announcement didn\u2019t send immediate panic through the cabin as the passengers had no idea why flight FR8321 was diverting. She said: \u2018It was clear that something was wrong. I would have to say the whole situation was dealt with amazingly and professionally.\u2019 One of the flight attendants became anxious and oxygen masks did not deploy for passengers in the cabin, she added. Passengers hailed the crew for their professionalism while the plane diverted to Barcelona. Several passengers tweeted updates while the plane was on the ground and the pilots were checked over. Fire trucks greeted the Boeing 737 when it touched down shortly after 10:15am local time as passengers began to grasp the nature of the emergency. Hannah, 31, said: \u2018We had very limited information until we were about to land. It was fairly calm on board, I have to say.\u2019 Once people learned of the reason for the emergency landing they became agitated that they weren\u2019t told sooner, she said. \u2018It\u2019s hot [on the plane], and people are pretty keen to get off or find out what\u2019s going on.\u2019 The flight crew declared an emergency over southern France and changed their flight path.

{"abstract": "The Lib Dems have proposed a new 8% levy on banks to help reduce the deficit, which would bring in an extra \u00a31billion a year. The British Banking Association has criticised the proposal, and Labour has proposed a tax on bank bonuses to pay for a jobs programme for young people. The Lib Dems are committed to eliminating the deficit by 2017/18, but want to raise at least \u00a38 billion through extra taxes, while the Tories insist it can be achieved through spending cuts alone.", "article": "Banks will be hit with an extra \u00a31billion tax until the deficit has been completely cleared, under new Lib Dem proposals. The new 8 per cent levy - which effectively strips the banks of the benefit of the Government's corporation tax cuts \u2013 will form a key plank of the party's election manifesto. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said the tax hike will help the next Government find the \u00a330billion of savings after the election needed to balance the books. The Lib Dem economic spokesman Danny Alexander wants to introduce a new 8 per cent levy on banks. Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18. But unlike the Tories - who say they would do it through spending cuts alone - the Lib Dems say they would seek to raise at least \u00a38 billion through extra taxes. The annual levy on banks, which was introduced in 2010, currently brings in around \u00a32.5billion a year. Mr Alexander's proposals are expected to take that up to \u00a33.5billion a year. A'mansion tax' on homes worth over \u00a32million will raise an extra \u00a31.5billion, and a crackdown on tax avoidance could save \u00a36billion, the Lib Dems claim. The Lib Dem economic spokesman said: 'Failings in the banking system were a major factor in the great crash of 2008. 'That's why we have always insisted that the banks help fund repairing the economy. 'To that end, we introduced the Bank Levy which is on track to raise \u00a38billion in this Parliament. 'With the final stage of deficit reduction requiring around \u00a330billion of savings, it would be totally wrong for all of that to be found from cuts to public services as the Conservatives propose. 'Liberal Democrats believe that we must balance the books and do so fairly, so it is only right to reconsider whether banks are making a fair contribution to deficit reduction. 'This tax would remain in place until that job is complete.' The Tories and Lib Dems are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18. But the Lib Dems want to raise at least \u00a38 billion through extra taxes, while George Osborne (pictured) insists it can be achieved through spending cuts alone. All the revenue raised from the new bank tax will go towards paying down the deficit. The Lib Dems will push for the measure to be included in the forthcoming Budget \u2013 but if the Tories resist, it will be included in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. Mr Alexander added: 'Many banks were left seriously weakened after the crash. 'But as a result of our comprehensive range of reforms, and the strong economic recovery, the banking sector is now returning to health and profitability. 'So now is the right time to ask the sector to contribute a little more to help us balance the nation's books. That's the right way to keep our strong economy on track, and build a fairer society too.' Industry group the British Banking Association criticised the proposal, saying that banks in the UK already pay more tax than any other industry. Labour's shadow treasury secretary Chris Leslie added: 'Nobody will trust what the Lib Dems say after they broke their promises on tax by raising VAT on families while giving millionaires a huge tax cut. 'Labour will introduce a tax on bank bonuses to pay for a jobs programme for young people. We'll reverse this Government's \u00a33billion a year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners to help get the deficit down fairly. 'And we'll increase the bank levy, which has raised over \u00a32billion less than the Government promised, to pay for more free childcare for working parents. The Lib Dems have joined the Tories in opposing all these fair policies.'"}

Roy Hodgson has said that Kane must prove he belongs in the squad, and that he will take a decision with Tottenham after talks with Hodgson.", "article": "Harry Kane turned to social media on Thursday, full of emotion after England manager Roy Hodgson called him up for the first time. The Tottenham striker talked of \u2018pride\u2019 and \u2018honour\u2019 on Twitter after being named in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next Friday and the friendly in Italy four days later. Kane, who has scored 26 goals for Tottenham this season, merits his place alongside England captain Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck. Liverpool\u2019s Raheem Sterling is also in the squad but a niggling toe injury could see him play against Lithuania and sit out the Italy clash. Scroll down for full squad. Harry Kane celebrates after scoring for Tottenham Hotspur against Arsenal at White Hart Lane last month. Kane rounds QPR goalkeeper Rob Green to score Spurs' second goal at Loftus Road on March 7. \u2018The whole country is excited to see Harry Kane,\u2019 said Hodgson. \u2018His rise has been fantastic. He deserves his chance. He hasn\u2019t been in the squad before, but he has to show he belongs.\u2019 Beyond that, poor Kane discovered what it is really like to be a senior international when he was immediately caught in a club-versus-country row. First the background. The lure of the Aussie dollar has seen Tottenham agree to play Sydney FC on May 30, six days after the final game of the Premier League season. That same weekend, the England squad meet to prepare for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 in Dublin, followed by the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia on June 14. There is also a possibility that Kane, a regular in Gareth Southgate\u2019s Under 21 squad, will be selected for the European Championship starting on June 17. \u2018Playing for England at Under 21 level is more important than a friendly in Australia and I would be hypocritical if I didn\u2019t give that answer,\u2019 said Hodgson. \u2018This business about being tired \u2014 he\u2019s played quite a lot of games but he\u2019s not played any more than Wayne Rooney, Jordan Henderson, Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and lots of other players. \u2018If he needs a rest there\u2019s a great opportunity when the season ends, before our Under 21s get together. You can\u2019t expect me to say, \u201cOh no, I understand he will play in Australia and be resting when the Under 21s pitch up\u201d.\u2019 Kane celebrates after scoring for England U21 against Croatia in a Euro 2015 qualifier last year. Still, Tottenham were adamant on Thursday that Kane will travel to Australia to fulfil the Sydney fixture. Kane, 21, has played 42 times for Spurs this season and his goals in three competitions \u2014 Premier League, Europa League and Capital One Cup \u2014 have earned him international recognition. Inevitably, boss Mauricio Pochettino would prefer the potential PFA Player of the Year to put his feet up this summer. There is a fear of burn-out. \u2018We will speak (with Hodgson). It\u2019s a good chance to speak because England train here,\u2019 said Pochettino after England\u2019s squad of 24 was announced. \u2018We always try to find what is best for the player. We need to understand every position, but we have a good relationship and after that (talks with Hodgson) we will take a decision.\u2019 As for Kane, he is concerned only with proving himself to the England manager. \u2018I\u2019ll be aiming to compete and get myself in the team,\u2019 he said. \u2018There are a lot of great players there and I haven\u2019t had time to think about what\u2019s happened but I\u2019m enjoying every minute and want it to continue.\u2019 Beyond the Kane situation, Hodgson had to attend to some general housekeeping at Wembley on Thursday, such as the knockout blow Phil Bardsley seemed to land on his pal Rooney at the captain\u2019s Cheshire home last month. Hodgson said he had no view on the incident, which was revealed last weekend in a Sunday newspaper. \u2018You will have to guess whether I am concerned but Wayne\u2019s celebration against Tottenham was one way to take the sting out of the situation,\u2019 said Hodgson. On Monday, when the squad meet at St George\u2019s Park, it will be the first time Hodgson has seen them since November. He had hoped to meet the players at a dinner in January but club managers were against the idea. England manager Roy Hodgson takes his seat before announcing his squad at Wembley on Thursday. Instead, Hodgson recorded a video message which was sent to the squad via England\u2019s video analyst Andy Scoulding and was downloaded on to their iPads. \u2018I don\u2019t want to do the Sherlock Holmes bit to find out who has and who hasn\u2019t watched it,\u2019 said Hodg"}

Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France. Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries. Ronaldo pictured following Brazil's 3-0 defeat by France at the 1998 World Cup final at the Stade de France. Ronaldo looks gutted after the loss as he was not himself in a final where the pressure seemed to get to him.

Civil action in a Rio court, a Rio medical council action against two team medics (both of whom were unanimously absolved of blame) and an investigation in Brazil's national congress have shed some light on the events of  July 12 1998 but it continues to be a source of consternation in the country. The official records show the match ended in a 3-0 defeat for Brazil but the story of what happened in and around the Stade de France that afternoon is murkier in detail. Ronaldo, then just 21, had been outstanding all tournament in a Brazil side - including Cafu, Roberto Carlos and Bebeto - that were defending their title from 1994. The final was billed as a head-to-head between him and France's equally captivating talisman Zinedine Zidane. In the event, the France midfielder steamrollered a jaded Brazil outfit, scoring two first half headed goals in a man of the match performance with Emmanuel Petit adding a third after a late counter-attack. It was the first time France had been crowned world champions but it later transpired much of the drama had already happened, out of view of the many millions of TV viewers worldwide. The day had began in a relaxed fashion for the Brazil players. The whole squad had lunch at the Chateau de Grande Romaine, just outside Paris then returned to their rooms. Ronaldo was sharing with Roberto Carlos, neighbouring a room with Edmundo and Doriva. France's Zinedine Zidane sees his header go through the legs of Brazil's Roberto Carlos in the final.

Roberto Carlos implied Ronaldo was wilting under the weight of expectation of the nation. 'He was scared about what lay ahead,' he said, 'The pressure had got to him and he couldn't stop crying.' To government congress later, Edmundo described a viscerally shocking scene as suddenly Ronaldo started to have a fit. He frothed at the mouth and began to shake uncontrollably. Roberto Carlos, overwhelmed by panic, started screaming for help. 'When I saw what it was, I despaired,' said Edmundo, 'Because it was a really strong and shocking scene.' He ran through the hotel hitting on all the doors and shouting for everyone to come. A congressmen asked the striker for more details. 'Was Ronaldo hitting out or shaking?' 'Hitting out a lot,' replied Edmundo. 'Lying down?' 'Lying down and hitting himself with his hands like this, with his teeth...' 'Together?' 'Locked together and with his mouth foaming.' 'His whole body hitting itself?' 'The whole body, yes.' Defender Cesar Sampaio put his hand in Ronaldo's mouth to unravel his tongue and prevent him swallowing it.

{"abstract": "Nick Clegg has proposed a policy to triple paternity leave for new fathers from two weeks to six weeks, with the leave being paid at the maternity leave rate of \u00a3138.18 a week. The policy is aimed at encouraging men to be more involved in childcare and to challenge gender stereotypes. The policy would cost \u00a358 million a year and would be introduced in 2018-19 after consultation with businesses.", "article": "Nick Clegg will promise new fathers six weeks of paternity leave if his party gets into government for a second term. Nick Clegg will promise new fathers six weeks of paternity leave if his party gets into government for a second term. The Liberal Democrats would triple the amount of leave for dads of newborns from the current two weeks \u2013 and pay them the maternity leave rate of \u00a3138.18 a week. It will be seen as a bid to woo women voters and young families ahead of the General Election, but will face concerns from the business community. Mr Clegg has already pushed for shared parental leave, which starts from next week (April 5). It means parents can split a year off work between them at statutory pay. This means that a mother who wishes to end her maternity leave \u2013 and pay \u2013 early to return to work, can hand over their entitlement to the child\u2019s father. But Mr Clegg and the business minister Jo Swinson announced today that fathers can have an extra four weeks leave at home with the child\u2019s mother, and both would be entitled to pay. Mr Clegg believes the two-week period fathers get is often treated as a holiday, and extending it would encourage men to be more involved in childcare. The policy will be in the party\u2019s manifesto and would be introduced in 2018-19 after consultation with businesses. They hope half a million fathers would benefit from the scheme which would cost \u00a358million a year, and be paid for once the deficit is cleared. Mr Clegg said today: \u2018The Liberal Democrats want to tear down the barriers that stop people reaching their full potential. For too long, mums have been told their place is at home with their child, while dads return to work. I want parents to choose for themselves how to balance work and family.\u2019 The entitlement would be under a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 basis so fathers must start their six weeks\u2019 leave within eight weeks of their child\u2019s birth and cannot transfer it to the mother. Mr Clegg was promoting his policy to treble paternity leave to six weeks with Lib Dem minister Jo Swinson (right) as he visited\u00a0Play Town soft play centre in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire. Labour have already pledged to increase paid paternity leave to four weeks \u2013 and increase paternity pay - which triggered criticism from small businesses that the costs would be prohibitive. But Lib Dem sources said the policy would help businesses retain staff who wanted to take time off with their families. Around 55pc of fathers take the full two weeks currently available. One of Mr Clegg\u2019s early schemes, in 2011, to encourage parents to share their time off \u2013 called Additional Paternity Leave \u2013 was a flop after being found to have an uptake of only 1pc. Scroll down for video. Mr Clegg, who yesterday tried his hand at making pancakes on a visit to Cardiff, believes the two-week period fathers get is often treated as a holiday, and extending it would encourage men to be more involved in childcare. It allowed fathers to take the statutory six months maternity leave instead of mothers, but the downside was that they would not get any pay after the first two weeks. Lib Dem sources said: \u2018There was low uptake of that scheme because it wasn\u2019t paid, so families made decisions based on their finances. And of course there was also a cultural barrier. \u2018But we believe six weeks of paternity leave on statutory pay will be popular and help to change attitudes. There has been no greater champion for this in government than Jo Swinson, she pushed for six weeks paternity leave in government but the Tories blocked it.\u2019 The scheme is modelled on a similar one in Sweden in which fathers get a \u2018daddy month\u2019 and also the right to shared leave for more than a year. Uptake is high because fathers are entitled to 90pc of their full pay. But Miss Swinson said yesterday that the aim was to \u2018challenge the gender stereotypes that all too often write fathers off as hapless or bumbling\u2019. She added: \u2018Liberal Democrats want to triple paternity leave, to encourage new dads to spend more time with their child in those vital early weeks and month after birth. Most fathers want to spend more time with their new baby \u2013 and we know it makes a positive difference for children when they do.\u2019"}

(right) They spent time in captivity with Mr Haines, 44,\u00a0a former RAF aircraft engineer who was kidnapped in March 2013 while working for an aid agency in Syria. The book's writer Mr H\u00e9nin - who has a four-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son - and illustrator Mr Torres, have now paid tribute to Mr Haines as the inspiration behind the sweet tale. It tells the tale of a father hedgehog who is carried off in a picnic basket by humans after falling into a picnic basket while foraging for food for his family. A little boy holds him captive in a box in the garden shed, saying: 'You'll be my favourite animal. I'll teach you tricks and you'll do anything I want.' The hedgehog manages to escape and heads off on a series of adventures with a cast of helpful animals, including a rat, a cat and an eagle, before finally returning home. Mr H\u00e9nin, whose five-year old daughter is almost exactly the same age as Mr Haines's youngest, Athea, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The idea was to create poetry from the obscene. 'We had dreamed together about our life after the ordeal and the meeting of our two daughters. French journalists Nicholas\u00a0H\u00e9nin (left) and\u00a0Pierre Torres (right) spent time with Mr Haines as ISIS captives. 'Even if he didn't write this book, his spirit is in this work.

Though Mr\u00a0H\u00e9nin and Mr Torres both made it back to their families - the French government has denied paying a \u00a312 million ransom for their release - Mr Haines did not as he was savagely beheaded. British militant Jihadi John, since unmasked as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, carried out the horrific murder in September 2014. Mr Haines' name does not appear in Mr\u00a0H\u00e9nin and Mr Torres' book -\u00a0written on scraps of paper and card they managed to hide from their captors - but the idea for it came from a game of turning people into animals which started with the former\u00a0RAF aircraft engineer. Mr Haines with his daughter Athea.\u00a0Mr H\u00e9nin has a five-year old daughter almost exactly the same age. The Frenchmen chose the prickly hedgehog for their book because they are known for finding their way home even if displaced. At one point the main character spots a squashed colleague on the road he is desperately trying to cross - the only one allusion to the death of a fellow hostage. As well as Mr Haines the French pair spent time in captivity with freelance journalist John Cantlie, American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Brit Alan Henning. Mr Cantlie is still being held. Apart from him all but Mr\u00a0H\u00e9nin and Mr Torres were murdered by their jihadi captors.

The change of career has been funded by online bookmakers Betfair, and the former cyclist hopes to obtain her Category A amateur license which would allow her to ride in amateur races on the Flat and over jumps, as well as compete in the point-to-point field. She told the Daily Mirror: 'I've been looking for a new and exciting challenge, and when they approached me about the opportunity to become a licensed amateur jockey, it captured my imagination.\u00a0I'm motivated by the scale of the challenge and the opportunity to combine my love of horses with learning a new skill under the guidance of racing experts put together for me.' 'I will be working closely with Yogi Breisner, Chris King and Paul Nicholls to help train and advise me over the next 12 months. Pendleton says she been looking for a new and exciting challenge since retiring. Pendleton has been praised by trainer Nicholls, who says she is an outstanding athlete with a real drive. 'My team and I have identified the ambitious target of riding competitively in the Foxhunters Chase at Cheltenham Festival next year, but the initial focus will be on getting me to a level whereby I am granted an amateur jockey licence, which is a significant challenge in itself given that I had never even sat on a horse until a week ago.' Nicholls added: 'Victoria Pendleton is an outstanding athlete with a real drive and determination, so whilst this is an incredibly difficult challenge, these attributes are exactly what you need to become a jockey. 'Having the competitive mind set of an Olympic champion, I've no doubt will put her in a great place to succeed in this challenge whilst also shining a much deserved light on the sport of horse racing.'

Breisner, who is the eventing performance manager for Team GB, will be acting as a mentor to Pendleton and believes her athletic mindset will be a huge plus. He said: 'Victoria is a hugely talented, ambitious and gutsy individual, and these traits will stand her in the best stead possible for achieving this ambitious goal. 'Having worked with her for a week, the progress she has already made in such a small amount of time is quite frankly remarkable. It's a real privilege to work with Victoria on a challenge of this magnitude. 'While no one under estimates the scale of the challenge ahead, Victoria's undoubted mental and physical strength, coupled with the team Betfair have put together to help her with this challenge, means we are in a fantastic position for Victoria to achieve the ambitious goal of riding at Cheltenham Festival in 2016'."}

The karaoke king was performing Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild at a strip club contest in Croydon, south London when he tumbled off the podium. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stage-dive didn't help the singer's shot at winning the competition and he missed out on the prize. Judges at a talent contest  in Croydon were given a shock when one the performers fell off the stage. The performer attempted to grab the podium's pole but missed and tumbled off the stage onto the judges. The accident happened at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club last month during the final of the venue's popular Talent Show night. A recording made of the evening shows the performer, who has not been named, belting out the rock classic on the club's stage, which features a pole for the venue's usual performers. In the footage, the man warms up the crowd by playing air guitar and posturing before attempting to swing around the pole at the centre of the stage. But the man's hand passes several inches from the pole and he flies past it and - to screams from the crowd - falls straight off the stage and on to the line of judges. Luckily, a judge manages to move out of the way as the man falls and the performer hits the ground with a thud, but is said to be fine.

But footage from the venue shows the man missing the pole completely and falling face-first, into the crowd. Uthania Jackson, manager of the club, was one of the judges and said the'regular' was uninjured and has since been back for more.

Mr Jackson was uninjured and instead chose to award the talent contest prize to a group of four women, called the 'Hustler Honeys', who performed a raunchy routine from Moulin Rouge on February 27. The stage-dive could not have gone worse for the man's chances of winning the contest as he landed on one of three judges lined up to choose the winner.

Scroll down for video. Mohammed Emwazi (pictured) who was revealed as Islamic State's cold-blooded executioner Jihadi John this week, was a member of a terror cell that was known to have links to the failed July 21 attacks on London. The revelation has raised even more questions over how Emwazi, the Islamic State extremist behind the beheading of western hostages, was able to run away from Britain and the scrutiny of the security services despite being a member of the watched terror cell. Emwazi, who was brought up in west London, was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection. It was revealed this week that he was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab. MI5 was also aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. And now, even more worryingly, it has been revealed at least one member of his network had a connection with the worst terrorist atrocity to take place on British soil. The failed July 21 attacks came just two weeks after four men blew themselves up on London's tubes and a bus, killing 52 people and injuring more than 700 in 2005. CCTV footage of failed July 21 bomber Hussein Osman (circled in green) at Clapham Junction train station. Metropolitan Police footage  showing Ismail Abdurahman with Hussein Osman at Vauxhall train station. Court documents seen by The Observer reveal a leading member of Emwazi's network had a phone conversation on the day of the attacks with Hussein Osman, who was later jailed for life for placing an explosive at Shepherd's Bush tube station. The documents show that security services were aware that associates of the 12-strong west London terror group had joined the four July 21 bombers at a training camp in Cumbria a year before the attempted terror attack. On Friday, Boris Johnson lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May for watering down strict anti-terror powers which may have helped Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria. The London Mayor accused his Tory leadership rival of giving the 'benefit of the doubt' to terror suspects like Emzawi. Mr Johnson's attack comes amid the growing controversy over who is to blame for MI5's failure to stop 'known wolf' Emwazi leaving Britain for the front line in Syria in 2013. The Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson admitted MI5 may have'slipped up'. But he said: 'One won't know until there's been an inquiry or a report of some kind.' But experts believe Emwazi was helped to escape Britain by his terror associates who had been allowed back to London by the Government in 2011. Mayor of London Boris Johnson (pictured right) lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May on Friday for 'watering down' strict anti-terror powers which may have helped Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria. It is understood that three members of Emwazi's network were made subject in 2011 to control orders brought in by the last Labour government, which meant they had to live outside London. But the control orders were disbanded by the coalition and they were instead subject to Tpims \u2013 terrorism prevention and investigation measures \u2013 which allowed them to return to London and re-engage with Emwazi. Two of the men on these weakened orders \u2013 known only as BX and CC in the court documents \u2013 aided with money, a false identity and bogus travel documents by the London jihadi cell. The power to relocate terror suspects was reintroduced a fortnight ago, under growing pressure from the security services. Mr Johnson slammed the 2011'mistake' to scrap the 'internal exile' powers contained in Labour's control order regime. The Mayor of London said: 'We need to keep a very, very close eye on these people. 'The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down I think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and look after them, to monitor them properly.

It plans to put cheap. programmable chips in watches that will let wearers from China. to Chicago make payments with a swipe of the wrist. Swatch Group will start offering watches with near. field communication (NFC) chips within two months, said at a news conference on the company's. annual results which were released last month. Scroll down for video. We're coming for you Apple! Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said Apple's launch was a 'fantastic opportunity' for the Swiss watchmaker. The rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula. Andrew Sheehy, chief analyst at Generator Research, sees the retail value of wearable Internet-connected devices at $93.1 billion by 2018, versus $4.1 billion in 2014, with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market's value in 2018. Apple's move into watches would open up a market where. Swatch was already well positioned to compete, he said. The Swiss company's strategy appears to revolve around. including individual tech features in different models rather. than going head to head with Apple, the world's most valuable. firm, to create all-in-one smartwatches combining many. functions. 'We are the world champions of integrating smart functions. into a watch,' Hayek said. 'We don't want to produce a mini. mobile phone on your wrist. Others can do that.' At 1600 GMT, Swatch shares were up 2.7 percent at 432.1. Swiss francs. Apple's watch will go on sale in nine countries starting in. April, priced from $349 for the smaller model and $549 for the. standard version, although a high-end 'Edition' watch will sell. for at least $10,000. 'It's a fantastic opportunity for us. It is opening the. market. 'Especially in the U.S., many people are not wearing. watches any more. Somebody is opening this up. Let Apple do the. work. It's fine. It's good. I congratulate them.' The new connected watch 'Swatch Touch Zero One'which will go on sale within months. Both firms' strategies could co-exist and succeed, Hayek. said, before adding a dig at the bigger rival: 'Upgrading. software every year, that's not our business.' For its near-field chips, which will cost around 2 francs. ($2) per watch, Swatch has teamed up with China UnionPay, the. Chinese credit card association, as well as a Swiss bank and a. major credit card company. The credit card company, described as an Olympics sponsor,. is likely to be Visa, a long-time backer of the event. Visa was not immediately available to comment. Swatch is also launching a range of sports-themed 'Swatch. Touch' smartwatches which will be able to 'buddy up' with a. smartphone via a Bluetooth connection. The first model will retail at 135 francs, about twice the. cost of a regular Swatch watch with an NFC chip."}

Other advice given by Goop includes getting 12-14 hours of sleep a day and spending time in the bathtub, pool, or sea.", "article": "Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to'relax their vigilance over food', and to always'remind' themselves: 'You don\u2019t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video. Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath\u00a0Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions. Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece \u2013 such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet \u2013 have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop\u2019s advice. 'Although not as \"sexy\" as \"anti-inflammatory diets\" and \"magical cures\", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website\u2019s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic\u2019s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a \u2018magical cure\u2019 for morning sickness \u2013 while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation \u2013 Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004. Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you\u2019re pregnant!'

The victims were sitting on Kenneth French's porch when a man, later identified as Raymone Jackson, marched up to them and opened fire. Jackson was sentenced to 11 months in the Wayne County Jail in September 2013 in a drug case while on parole for a 2010 drug conviction.

The artwork, which is made of black granite set in MDF and steel, is 7.2ft high, 10ft wide and 2ft deep. The piece starts with England's 1874 loss to Scotland and ends with its 1998 World Cup loss against Romania. If continued until today, it would also incorporate Britain's losses to Uruguay and Italy in last year's World Cup. Also etched onto the granite would be the team's 4-1 humiliation at the hands of Germany in 2010 and the 2006 exit on penalties against Portugal.

The monument is being offered with a guide price of \u00a3400,000 - \u00a3600,000, which the average England footballer could pay for with one months' salary. CNN reported Cattelan as explaining it was 'a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death'. Cattelan is notorious for his often satirical and biting art displays. Perhaps his best known piece is an effigy of Pope John Paul II being crushed by a meteor.

The statue, entitled 'HIM', attracted a large number of visitors when it was first installed in November 2012. The work was visible only from a distance, and the artist did not initially say what he intended viewers to read into Hitler's pose. Organisers of the exhibition of which the statue was a part said its point was to make people reflect on the nature of evil - but others were furious by its placement in such a sensitive site.

Several other providers were present, and none of them knew, either. \"You should definitely call him and tell him,\" a health care lawyer, who was present, said. \"You have to provide full disclosure.\" \"But presumably, he knows that you might do so,\" I said.  \"And if you told him, he might not come in for the check-up.\" Marfan syndrome affects connective tissue and can lead to sudden tears in the aortic artery, causing sudden death.  Yet if treated, it poses much less risk, though not necessarily zero. The case raised several specific quandaries about what the responsibilities of medical professionals are and should be -- legally or ethically -- in evaluating pilots. The FAA requires that pilots self-report any diagnoses.  But health care professionals have no obligation to notify anyone.  They may know that a pilot has a medical problem that is poorly or not treated and may endanger passengers, but these providers have no obligation to do anything about it. These issues are crucial, given that Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the Germanwings Flight 9525, killing 150 passengers. We still don't know why he committed suicide-murder, but the latest reports indicate he was treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot license. The Germanwings disaster has demonstrated that current standards of medical and psychiatric evaluation are inadequate. The FAA requires only that pilots fill out a psychological questionnaire, asking whether they have had psychological symptoms.  But pilots are not assessed in person by a psychiatrist. Such face-to-face assessments can provide crucial information that self-report forms might miss, partly because pilots might answer inaccurately. Moreover, the FAA requires only that 25% of pilots have a single random drug screen per year.  Pilots may pass drug tests in January and realize that the odds of undergoing subsequent tests that year are nil.  They may hence use more alcohol and recreational drugs. We need to consider changing current policies.  Some alterations are relatively easy.  The FAA should consider requiring far more drug testing -- for all pilots, perhaps every few days. Other possible reforms pose difficult ethical dilemmas, and thus need broad, careful discussion -- e.g., what role providers should play and how much privacy pilots should have. Medical exams and records over time can indicate key problems that a single visit to an FAA doctor may miss.  But requiring more information from pilots diminishes their rights to privacy.  Indeed, such rights impeded investigators from knowing initially the reason Lubitz took a six-month leave and the nature of his medical condition. Physicians have to break patient confidentiality when third parties may be endangered.  The legal precedent for breaking patient confidentiality in this way is the so-called Tarasoff case, in which a young patient told his psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley that he wanted to kill his girlfriend, Tatiana Tarasoff.  The psychologist alerted the campus police, though not the city police or Tarasoff. Unfortunately, the patient then killed Tarasoff.  A court found the psychologist liable. These violations of patient confidentiality make us providers uncomfortable. As a physician, I have had to report patients whom I even suspected might be abusing a child.  I remember one patient who came to the emergency room for psychiatric problems mentioning that she sometimes hit her toddler son with the end of an electrical cord, swinging it until the thick part banged him.  As I asked more, she began to cry. I felt terrible for her and was unsure how dangerous her actions were, but I erred on the side of protecting the child's safety and contacted social services.  When I told her, she nodded, then whispered thank you.  She knew she needed help. Still, in Germany and several states, providers do not have to break patient confidentiality, even when they think the patient may endanger others. Critical dilemmas arise, though, of what threshold should be used concerning which diagnoses and how much their successful treatment should matter.  Some diagnoses may be treatable and thus permissible if doctors examine the pilot more frequently than once a year. Early in the HIV epidemic, for instance, some critics argued that HIV-infected pilots should be barred from flying, since the virus could cause neurological problems.  Fortunately, the FAA decided that evidence of actual neurological deficits -- not infection alone -- should ground these employees. Physicians arguably should consider reporting pilots who have, for instance, epilepsy, manic-depression or diabetes that leads to coma if these conditions are not well controlled with medications. Yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment.  The FAA could require that"}

The images resurfaced last month during the terrorism conspiracy trial in New York of Al Qaeda lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for the terrorist organisation in London in the mid-1990s. They were taken by Palestinian journalist Abdel Barri Atwan, who was invited to the hideout in 1996 as part of Bin Laden's ploy to spread his message of hate to the Western world. The 9/11 mastermind had declared war on America and planned a media campaign to garner international attention. Scroll down for video. Image: Osama Bin Laden holds a Kalashnikov rifle in Tora Bora, a mountainous region of Afghanistan, in November 1996. The Al Qaeda leader spent years developing a network of tunnels and caves in the area. On message: The terrorist mastermind had, by this point, declared war on the United States and tried to use international press coverage to spread the word. Perception: The militant would sit in front of Islamic books when recording his video messages to make it seem like he was intellectual. Entourage: A smiling Bin Laden is seen walking around Tora Bora surrounded by bodyguards, loyal followers and family members. Lair: The rare images of Bin Laden in his home setting were released as part of the trial of Al Qaeda lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for Al Qaeda in London in the mid-1990s. Companion: He sits alongside Syrian-born ideologue Abu Musab al-Suri, a Bin Laden ally who once ran training camps inside Afghanistan. It included his first television interview for CNN's Peter Arnett and Peter Bergen in 1997 and a sit-down for ABC News' John Miller a year later. 'He wanted media exposure,' Atwan told CNN's Bergen for his 2006 book, The Osama Bin Laden I Know. 'He wants to say, \"Now I am an international figure; I'm not just a Saudi. I am aggrieved at Americans who are occupying Saudi Arabia who are desecrating the Holy Land\"', said Atwan. He was seen making video announcements in front of shelves of Islamic books - in a bid to make him look intelligent - and was captured with a wide grin as he strolled around the isolated compound. For several years, he developed an intricate network of caves and dwellings 14,000ft up in the White Mountains. He discovered the area during the anti-Soviet war in the 1980s, and decided to settle and set up the compound  in 1996 - when the Taliban had taken control of Afghanistan. Bin Laden chose the location because of its proximity to the border with Pakistan, while the rugged terrain meant it would be difficult for opposition forces to attack on foot. The system of caves and underground passages meant he would also be protected from air attacks. He told Atwan during the interview: 'I feel really secure in the mountains.' According to reports Bin Laden would spend hours on long hikes through the mountains, always carrying a Russian-made Kalashnikov rifle by his side. Bodyguards, militants and children - including his sons - would constantly follow him around as he looked for new hideout locations. He told his family members they needed to know the terrain and the tunnel system inside out in case of an attack. Reporter: The rare pictures were yielded by\u00a0Palestinian journalist Abdel Barri Atwan (right) \u00a0during an interview in 1996. Bin Laden wanted the media coverage to project his status as an international terrorist leader. Force: Dozens of fighters would accompany him on the long walks. They would stay in the compound alongside Bin Laden's multiple wives and children. Primitive: One of Bin Laden;s hideaways was made mud and stone and propped up by wooden struts. Escape: Pictured is a secret passageway - part of the intricate network that lay in the mountainside. Bin Laden told his sons they had to know well the tunnel network in case the area came under attack. Home: A two-bedroom house - made out of mud and stone - where Bin Laden lived in Tora Bora. Sparse: A child's tricycle is seen outside one of the many isolated homes designed for the terrorist leader. His children were fed a limited diet of rice, bread, eggs and salty cheese. Keeping guard: A boy stands outside one of the primitive houses holding a\u00a0Kalashnikov. Most people living in the compound would always walk around with a rifle. Gallop: The militant is seen riding on a horse below his compound. He escaped Tora Bora on horseback when Western forces were getting closer to his hideout in 2001. The compound, nestled in the snow-covered mountains, was primitive and only connected to the nearest city of Jalalabad by dirt road. During the visit Atwan took a picture of a two-bedroom house made of mud and stone Bin Laden is believed to have shared with his wives and family. His children were believed to have suffered from"}

While expensive vintages develop their flavour over years in oak barrels, the makers of the Oak Bottle promise their gadget will replicate the ageing process in just 24 hours. It means drinks lovers could  enjoy the oaky flavours of premium tipples without having to fork out the high prices they demand. Scroll down for video. The Oak Bottle can turn cheap booze into fine wine with a vintage oak taste, its makers claim. All users need to do is pour their favourite wines in the bottle, which is made of sustainably sourced American oak, and then leave it for up to two days to take on the flavour of the receptacle. The bottle, which costs $79.99 (\u00a350) from oakbottle.com, can also be used to improve the flavours of brandies, bourbons and even tequila. It's the brainchild of Canadian entrepreneur Joel Paglione, who came up with the idea after growing up on his parent's vineyard. Mr Paglione, 30, who now lives in Chicago, spent three years developing the Oak Bottle, which he says is the world's smallest and fastest way to infuse drinks with oak. Eight other versions which are flavoured with the likes of cherry, vanilla, maple and coffee are also available. He said: 'The Oak Bottle is a revolutionary device that makes cheap wine or spirits taste like an expensive vintage in just 24 to 48 hours. The Oak Bottle can also mellow the flavour of whisky, brandy and even tequila. 'What took months or years in oak barrels before takes just days now with Oak Bottle. 'My family has a vineyard and winery in Canada so I grew up in the wine making industry. 'Once I was old enough to help, I asked why we spend so much time filling small barrels of wine for oak ageing versus pouring it all into a giant barrel like we do the fermentation tanks. 'The answer, my father told me, was the smaller the oak barrel we use the faster the oak infusion and the faster we can achieve the desired oak tannin we are looking for in our wine.' The best wines spend years ageing in oak barrels. He then spent three years developing the Oak Bottle, which he claims is the'smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made'. Mr Paglione explained:\u00a0'It's all about the perfect amount of interaction with oxygen available for the liquid to \"breathe\" through the wood, and the perfect mount of oak contact of the liquid inside.' He said the most popular wines for oak bottle ageing are Chardonnay, Cabernet and Merlot. 'In just 48 hours an unoaked Chardonnay will taste like an expensive oaked Chardonnay vintage that has been aged in oak barrels for years,' he claimed. 'Whiskies, bourbons and brandy are also great for ageing with the Oak Bottle. He also thinks the bottle is good news for whisky makers as this will speed up the process. He said:\u00a0'Allowing people who perhaps could not afford a 20-year aged whiskey or that ten-year old wine vintage the ability to enjoy it but at a fraction of the time and cost. 'We are not saying that the Oak Bottle will make a boxed wine into a \u00a350 bottle, but it can make an average wine much better and less insulting to your taste buds.' Despite just being launched, the Oak Bottle has already been given the thumbs up by top chefs including American TV personality Elizabeth Karmel. Miss Karmel, the star of US cooking show Iron Chef, carried out her own independent test of the Oak Bottle on tequila. She said: 'It is remarkable how this toasted Oak Bottle made by coopers has transformed the raw blanco tequila. 'The proof is in the tasting. It is layered with complexity - round, sweet and predictably oaky. I'd say that the experiment was a success.'"}

Lord West of Spithead said Russian espionage had soared to a \u2018worrying\u2019 level as president Vladimir Putin ordered more acts of \u2018provocation\u2019. Equipped with hi-tech surveillance, the converted fishing boats have been seen in the international waters of the North Sea by Nato aircraft. Lord West, a former First Sea Lord, said the Cold War tactic was designed to gain intelligence on Britain\u2019s nuclear missiles and warships.

They seem to have... increased espionage, which raises tension.\u2019 Lord West spoke out as Moscow mobilised the country\u2019s entire Northern Fleet to full combat readiness. In a show of strength, Putin deployed 45,000 troops, more than 56 warships and submarines, and 110 aircraft for training across the country and into the Barents Sea \u2013 dwarfing Nato military drills which will be held off Scotland next month. Lord West, a military grandee, said the five-day drills were a \u2018knee jerk\u2019 reaction to a similar Nato operation announced by Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday. Britain and 11 other Nato countries will contribute to the Joint Warrior exercise designed to send a signal to Moscow in the face of continued aggression \u2013 but with a force strength of less than a third. The operation \u2013 which was hailed by the Government as one of the largest land, air, and sea training exercises run in Europe \u2013 will feature just 12,000 military personnel. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how \u2018powerful\u2019 Nato was.

The Russians tried to monitor amphibious war games in the past and will sit in international waters monitoring communications traffic. In the past three weeks, Nato P3 Orion spy planes from the United States and Norway have reported six AGIs, adding to concerns that the Soviet activity is part of a planned maritime and air operation against the UK. The source said: \u2018While they look like fishing vessels they are packed with ECM (Electronic Counter Measures) and make no secret of their presence, all they want is to sit and test our reaction times and collate communications. \u2018The problem is that while we managed to deal with them in the 1980s by jamming their electronic \u2018listening\u2019 field, they had updated their systems with much greater capability and as long as they sit in international waters we can do nothing.\u2019 Scrambled: A Typhoon jet seen taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire at 4.30pm, shortly before Russian planes were intercepted last month.

Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange. Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident. Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. The incident, during United\u2019s 1-0 win at St James\u2019 Park on Wednesday, was not seen by referee Anthony Taylor or his assistants, but was caught on TV. A three-man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on Thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off, prompting the FA to bring a charge. An independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned. Cisse, 29, pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident. He is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in December for elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman. By contrast, Evans, 27, had denied the charge on Thursday, saying: \u2018I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.\u2019 Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday.

Prison officials only have enough pentobarbital for the scheduled executions of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday and Randall Mays on March 18, but they don't know how they will conduct lethal injections on four others scheduled for April. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice declined to say why it has not been able to obtain more pentobarbital from the same compounding pharmacy that provided the current batch of the powerful sedative last March. Texas's prison agency only has enough lethal pentrobarbital for two executions. Manuel Vasquez, left, is scheduled to be injected on Wednesday while Randall Mays (right) will be executed on March 18. Texas prison execute inmates in chambers like this one. But with limited pentobarbital, the state is looking into other options for execution. The state switched to that source several months after its previous supplier cut ties, citing hate mail and potential litigation after its name became public through an open records request from The Associated Press. Prison officials have since waged a legal battle to keep the name of its latest supplier secret, but it's unclear how much longer they can do so after a state judge last year ordered the agency to divulge the source. That ruling is on hold pending the outcome of the state's appeal. Prisons spokesman Jason Clark said the state's lawyers have advised the agency not to comment on whether the current supplier has backed out or whether the judge's order has affected its ability to find a supplier. Although Texas, traditionally the nation's busiest death penalty state, faces the most imminent deadline for replenishing its pentobarbital supply, other states are experiencing similar problems. For example, South Carolina ran out of pentobarbital \u2014 part of its three-drug execution formula \u2014 when the drug expired in 2013. The state has been unable to replenish its supplies because it can't find a company willing to sell them anymore, according to Corrections Director Bryan Stirling. The state's last execution was in 2011, and no new executions have been scheduled because cases are tied up in the appeals process. Kent Sprouse (pictured) is scheduled to be the next inmate to be executed after Mays. He is on death row for the shooting deaths of a North Texas police officer and another man in 2002. If Texas executes Vasquez and Mays as scheduled, a new supply of pentobarbital will be needed by April 9 when Kent Sprouse is scheduled to die for the shooting deaths of a North Texas police officer and another man in 2002. Three other prisoners are set to follow Sprouse to the death chamber in April, and at least one more is set for May. 'We're focused on multiple fronts,' Brad Livingston, the Texas agency's executive director, said last month before a prison board meeting in Austin. 'We're not ruling anything out, but clearly securing additional pentobarbital is part of our game plan.' Livingston was traveling Monday and not available to provide an update. While Texas prison officials administratively could change the lethal drug they use, a method change would require legislative action. 'At this time, it's not a topic of discussion,' said state Sen. John Whitmire, who chairs the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. Because pharmaceutical companies stopped selling U.S. prisons drugs for use in lethal injections, Texas and other death penalty states have turned to compounding pharmacies for made-to-order execution drugs. Last week, a Georgia woman's execution was delayed, then called off, when prison officials said they noticed the compounded pentobarbital planned for her lethal injection appeared cloudy, rather than clear. The Georgia Department of Corrections cited 'an abundance of caution' in delaying punishment for Kelly Gissendaner, who would have been the first woman put to death in that state in 70 years, and a second inmate, Brian Terrell, who was set to die this week.

The last 17 Texas executions, stretching back to September 2013, have used compounded pentobarbital, and the last nine from compounding pharmacies the state has refused to identify. Texas officials have insisted the identity should remain secret, citing a 'threat assessment' signed by Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw that says pharmacies selling execution drugs face 'a substantial threat of physical harm.'

High-resolution radar images of Venus were first obtained by Arecibo in 1988 and most recently by Arecibo and GBT in 2012.", "article": "For Earth-bound optical telescopes, the surface of Venus is shrouded beneath thick clouds made mostly of carbon dioxide. To penetrate this veil, probes like the Magellan spacecraft use radar to reveal remarkable features of the planet, such as mountains, craters, and volcanoes. But now, astronomers have combined the Green Bank Telescope with the radar transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory to make remarkably detailed images of the planet's surface from Earth. Pictured is a projection of the radar data of Venus collected in 2012. Striking surface features, like mountains and ridges, are easily seen. The black diagonal band at the center represents areas too close to the equator to obtain well-resolved image data. The radar signals from Arecibo in Puerto Rico passed through both Earth's atmosphere and the atmosphere of Venus. Here they hit the surface and bounced back to be received by the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia in a process known as bistatic radar. This capability is essential to study not only the surface as it appears now, but also to monitor it for changes. By comparing images taken at different periods in time, scientists hope to eventually detect signs of active volcanism. They believe images such as this could also reveal other dynamic geologic processes that could provide clues to Venus's geologic history and subsurface conditions. Spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a 'Y' shape on Venus (annotated image from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 shown). They say it is formed by winds pushing a 'wave' of clouds on the planet. These winds move faster at higher altitudes, creating the odd shape. 'It is painstaking to compare radar images to search for evidence of change,' said Bruce Campbell, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington,. 'The work is ongoing. In the meantime, combining images from this and an earlier observing period is yielding a wealth of insight about other processes that alter the surface of Venus.' Venus is slightly smaller than Earth but has a similar mass. It is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometres), and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. One day on Venus lasts as long as 243 Earth days. Its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. It's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable. The planet's extreme high temperatures of almost 480\u00b0C (900\u00b0F) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it. High-resolution radar images of Venus were first obtained by Arecibo in 1988 and most recently by Arecibo and GBT in 2012. When astronomers first started taking images of Venus, they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious 'Y' shape that covered the entire planet. Last week researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a 'wave' of clouds to produce a stretched effect. The discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow-rotating bodies in the solar system. The latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC) in Granada, Spain, in collaboration with the university of the Basque Country and the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences of Portugal. On Venus strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph (360km/h), circling the planet every four to five Earth days. But the planet itself takes almost 243 Earth days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet. The winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude, but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller. This ultimately gives rise to this 'Y' shape, as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly. To take the stunning images, astronomers combined the Green Bank Telescope (right) in West Virginia with the radar transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory (left) in Puerto Rico."}

Muodaoxi river is located within the Three Gorges Reservoir Region and the water level is controlled by the Three Gorges Dam. Spring is regarded as the best time to enjoy the scene as the Three Gorges Reservoir supplies water to the areas downstream, which brings down the water level. The natural phenomena is now so well known that once it appears each year word quickly spreads, causing a flood of tourists to take photographs from the nearby mountains and hills. 'It's a popular saying round here for the arrival of spring, we just say the turtle is coming,' said local Meng Liu. Although new to general tourists, the annual spectacle is well-known among locals. Instead of saying spring is coming, they say 'turtle is coming' When the river is at its normal depth at 175 metres, the island only shows a small tip above the water. In comparison, when the water falls to around 145 metres, the rock becomes connected to the mainland. The island is in the middle of Muodaoxi River which runs through Longshi village in Yunyang County in Chongqing city.

On last night's episode of the TLC series Who Do You Think You Are?, the show traveled to China for the first time as Julie uncovered the mystery behind her later grandfather Lou Gaw Tong's 'improper upbringing' and was led to her family's\u00a0ancestral\u00a0home where she met a distant relative that she didn't even know she had. 'My impression of my grandfather before I set out on this journey was I just thought of him as this big successful business man - this rich playboy guy - but now I respect him much more than I ever did,' the 45-year-old mom said of her mother's father, who died before she was born. Scroll down for video. Life-changing: Julie Chen couldn't stop smiling after she had arrived in China and learned that her maternal grandfather was a was a highly-respected philanthropist. Selfless act: The 45-year-old met with\u00a0Dr Andres Rodriguez at the Singapore Annkway Association, where she learned that her grandfather\u00a0Lou Gaw Tong risked his life for the Chinese resistance during World War II. At the start of the episode Julie explained that only knew that her grandfather had a dramatic 'rags to riches story' and many wives. Lou had made his money by opening grocery stores and later investing in a shipping company, essentially building himself an empire. He had nine wives, six of who bore him children. 'The stories I heard he liked to live large,' she said. 'I think he was someone who indulged in everything and anything.' Julie, who is married to Leslie Moonves, the President and CEO of CBS Corporation, said she was inspired to learn more about her family after the birth of their five-year-old son Charlie. 'Five years ago when my son was born it was like a revival of me trying to get back in touch with my Chinese roots,' she said. 'It's important for me to have it back in my life, so I could put it into my sons life.' Julie first traveled to the National Library of Singapor where she met with Jason Lim, historian from the University of Wollongong.\u00a0During her time with Jason, it was revealed that that her grandfather was described as having an 'improper childhood' - without any explanation as to what that meant. She also learned that Lou had relocated to\u00a0Rangoon, now Yangon in Myanmar, Burma, as a child and later moved to Singapore after World War II. Living legacy: Julie can be seen happily meeting with the children who attend the school that her grandfather had founded in 1937. Family history: The Talk co-host also met with the school's vice principal, who revealed that her great-grandfather was a government official. He was described as philanthropist, which was something Julie admitted that she had never heard about him before. After discovering that he was a member of the Singapore Annkway Association, she headed to the organization's headquarters in order to speak with historian Dr Andres Rodriguez and learn more about her relative. At the meeting, Dr Rodriguez told Julie that Lou would bravely travel to some of the most dangerous places to be during the war. As a part of the Chinese resistance, he risked his life by taking trucks of ammunition into Japanese occupied territory. 'I feel fortunate; I already feel like I've hit the jackpot,' she said. 'To see a document with your grandfather's name with a detailed account of what his role was during World War II... How many people get to say they have that?' She added: 'I have a new found respect for my grandfather.' Julie's next top was to the village in Anxi County where her grandfather was born to visit the Anshan School he had founded. Long-lost relative: Julie met her\u00a0grandfather's niece Ke Yuchai, who is actually her cousin once removed, during a trip to her ancestral home. Amazing talk: Julie was pictured speaking to Ke Yuchai with the help of a translator at her family's home in rural China. During her travels, she wondered if the school would be run down or if it was even still functioning. 'Wow, this is way more modern than I thought it would be,' she said when she arrived at her destination. The school's vice principal showed Julie her grandfather's name on a plaque outside of the building, which currently has 856 students. Julie was proud to learn that they all knew who were grandfather was. Because the school was about to publish a book about its history, the administrators were able to tell Julie that her family's ancestral home was still standing.

The final of the showpiece event in Qatar is to be on Sunday, December 18 - a decision which will allow traditional Boxing Day club matches to take place in Britain and avoid the fierce heat of June and July. It will be a shortened tournament over 28 days instead of the usual 32, starting on November 21. December 18 is also Qatar's national day. Manuel Pellegrini has expressed concern over the plans to play the Qatar 2022 World Cup in winter. The Manchester City manager watches on during his side's 1-0 defeat by Barcelona on Wednesday night. However, Pellegrini is concerned how Premier League games, which would usually be scheduled for November and December, will be caught up later in the season and the impact of doing so on the next domestic campaign. 'I think it is difficult to stop all the European leagues in that month, especially in our league at this moment, and not play football here in November and December,' Pellegrini said. 'When you recover those amount of games what will happen in the next season, when you finish late, how many days the national squad will need their players? 'I don't think it is easy. It is a big task.' Swansea manager Garry Monk echoed Pellegrini's thoughts, but conceded that teams would just have to 'get on with it'. Swansea boss Garry Monk says the break will be strange but the clubs will just have to get on with it. Roberto Martinez says teams around Europe will have to adapt to the affect of a winter World Cup. 'It will be strange having a two-month break in the middle of the season. I'm not sure how that's going to work and I'd have to see the exact lay-out of it, but I don't think it's a great thing,' he said. 'It's beyond the powers of Swansea City, but I can't imagine too many teams are happy with it. But it sounds as if we're just going to have to get on with it.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez conceded the tournament moving to November would need plenty of adaptation, but he always expected a World Cup in Qatar to be held over the winter. 'You need clarity and then you can prepare towards that,' Martinez said. 'But I always felt that once it was given to Qatar it was going to be a winter World Cup. 'When all the talk is about wanting the World Cup in different continents and different countries, and when the hosts are going to be Qatar, it's only normal that it's going to be played in the winter. 'That's going to affect two or three seasons around that date, but we need to adapt and make it a big football celebration like the World Cup's supposed to be.' Hull boss Steve Bruce says playing the World Cup in the winter is the only sensible solution. Hull manager Steve Bruce thinks a World Cup late in the year is a sensible move in such a hot climate, but took the chance to push for a winter break. He said: 'We've got plenty of time to adapt. I've always said in this country we need a break, we should copy everyone else. When you see other teams come back there's a freshness about them because of the winter break. 'We've got plenty of time to put the schedule in. Once FIFA picked Qatar there was only one solution and they've picked the sensible one.' West Brom manager Tony Pulis agreed. 'Whichever way you try to cook it they have worked it to suit the country at the best possible time. They have moved everything around to suit them, full stop,' he said. 'They are the governing body and, irrespective of what you do say and don't say, there might be loads of people unhappy with it, but they have got it through and it's been agreed. 'Everyone has to get on with it. What will be the situation in England, is everything is going to have to be reorganised and revamped? That's going to be interesting.'"}

The Black Cats have managed only 23 goals in their 28 Barclays Premier League fixtures to date this season, a return which has left them perched perilously close to the relegation zone as the season reaches crunch-point. Perhaps even more worrying is the fact that Gus Poyet's pool of frontmen has contributed just nine of those goals, a record Wickham knows simply has to improve if they are to avoid a second successive scramble for top-flight survival. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has only managed two goals since his January arrival from FC Toronto. 'I wouldn't say the criticism of the strikers is unfair,' admitted Wickham, speaking to the Northern Echo. 'Strikers are going to get the most at any club because they are the money-makers, they are the ones that the fans are relying on to score the goals. That's where the criticism can come. 'Chances come and you do need to put them away. We are creating chances. The way we set up, we are setting up to attack at times when we get the ball.

Wickham, 21, scored one of his three Premier League strikes this term against champions Manchester City. 'We have done it in games but we have to get more consistent with it and get in to the box more. We will climb away from the rest of the group down there if we can start to put our chances away.'

The win was \"very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against Liverpool and Barcelona,\" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who rested club captain Vincent Kompany. Elsewhere, four teams vying for Champions League spots all won. Manchester United claimed all three points at Newcastle when Ashley Young took advantage of keeper Tim Krul's error in the 89th minute; Arsenal doubled third-last QPR 2-1; surging Liverpool shut out second-last Burnley 2-0; and League Cup finalist Tottenham defeated Swansea 3-2 in a game overshadowed by French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsing to the turf. United defender Jonny Evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at St. James' Park, since he appeared to spit in striker Papiss Cisse's direction when they clashed in the first half. Cisse then appeared to spit back at Evans. Arsenal remained third, with United in fourth on 53 points, two better than Liverpool, four better than Southampton and six better than Spurs, who have a game in hand. In Wednesday's other match, Stoke extended Everton's league slide by blanking the Toffees 2-0 at home. Barcelona reaches Copa del Rey final. In Spain, meanwhile, Barcelona reached the Copa del Rey final by easing past Villarreal 6-2 on aggregate. Holding a 3-1 lead after the first leg, Barcelona won away by the same score Wednesday, helped by Neymar's double. Barcelona faces familiar foe Athletic Bilbao in May's finale. Bilbao advanced 3-1 on aggregate over Espanyol, prevailing in the second leg 2-0. Barcelona topped Bilbao in the 2009 and 2011 finals."}

The former Motherwell manager has been put in charge until the end of the season. The decision to replace caretaker Kenny McDowall, who has now left the club, is the second major upheaval at the club in the space of a week following Dave King's boardroom coup last Friday. Stuart McCall has been named Rangers manager until the end of the season. McCall, like the club's new board, is a man the Light Blues faithful can trust following his trophy-laden stint as Rangers player during the mid-90s. But the 50-year-old does not believe the former regime, backed by Newcastle United owner Ashley's millions, would have welcomed him through the front door on Edmiston Drive so readily. He said: 'I don't think I'd have been offered the job if the new regime hadn't come in. 'I had a chat with John Gilligan yesterday and Paul Murray late last night. It was a whirlwind. 'I'm delighted for the people in charge of the club because I know how much it means to them. I'm delighted for the supporters because that is what they want. McCall will attempt to guide Rangers to promotion from the Championship to the Scottish Premiership. 'That's not to say the people on the board are going to be great successes. But whatever they do, it will be for the good of the club.' McCall hopes he can lead the club to promotion and claim the job on a permanent basis. But he acknowledges the task will be a tough one. The former nine-in-a-row midfielder - who will give up his coaching duties with Scotland while in charge at Ibrox - said: 'My first question was: What do they deem a success? 'You could turn things around slightly, get to the play-off final, get your goalie sent-off after five minutes and then lose on penalty kicks. These are the thin lines between success and failure. 'I think success would be if we could start putting results together, getting belief in everyone, smiles on faces and turn things around.'"}

Handley, drafted in for only his second senior appearance as a replacement for shoulder injury victim Tom Briscoe, was among five different try scorers as the Rhinos overcame the absence of skipper Kevin Sinfield to condemn Wigan to a third defeat in six matches. Liam Sutcliffe proved an able deputy for the injured Sinfield, scoring a try and kicking three goals, but Leeds' hero was Australian prop Adam Cuthbertson, who also scored a try and proved a real handful for the visitors with his powerful running and skilful ball handling. Teenager Ash Handley scored the second try for Leeds Rhinos on Friday night. Leeds, who handed a recall to full-back Zak Hardaker pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation, were good value for their fifth win of the campaign but could never relax against their injury-hit opponents. The home side made the brighter start without finding the finishing touches and Wigan, captained by Leeds-born hooker Michael McIlorum, opened the scoring from their first real attack, with centre Anthony Gelling breaking clear to get the supporting Matty Smith over after 10 minutes. Smith kicked the conversion and added a penalty six minutes later after Cuthbertson was pulled up for a high tackle on George Williams to make it 8-0. However, the Warriors made a hash of the restart and never touched the ball for the next eight minutes as Leeds struck a purple patch with three tries. Substitute Brad Singleton went over for the third try for Leeds Rhinos. Cuthbertson, who qualifies for England, got the first, following up a grubber kick on the last tackle by hooker Paul Aiton and was also involved in a sweeping move that was finished at the corner by Handley. The former Newcastle Knights forward then produced a superb short pass to get substitute Brad Singleton over and Sutcliffe kicked his second goal to make it 18-6. Wigan finally managed to stem the tide and struck back four minutes before the break when left winger Joe Burgess caught Williams' kick on the full to dive over for a spectacular try, which was goaled by Smith to cut the gap to just two points. Defences got on top in the second half, with Wigan having to do most of the work as the Rhinos gained the momentum. Referee Richard Silverwood gave the visitors a team warning after they conceded a string of penalties and the pressure told on the hour when Sutcliffe stretched out of a two-man tackle to score his side's third try. Sutcliffe was off target with the conversion attempt but succeeded with a penalty five minutes later after he was tackled by Wigan's Liam Farrell from an offside position. Farrell was sin-binned for the offence and the Rhinos made the most of their man advantage when substitute Rob Burrow forced his way over from dummy half with 11 minutes to go."}

June Harding, 46, and husband Paul, 45, of Montacute, Somerset, left their 31 dogs, seven cats and four guinea pigs to sleep in such filthy surroundings that RSPCA officers were overwhelmed by the stench of ammonia and had to call off the visit. Police who visited their home had to abandon the search because of the overbearing stench of ammonia and RSPCA inspectors described the conditions as 'appalling'. They managed to save 40 of the animals but every single animal rescued had respiratory problems due to the lack of ventilation and vets recommended two were put down. The pair were each sentenced to 12 weeks in prison at Taunton Magistrates Court in Somerset after pleading guilty to a total of 28 charges of animal neglect. Sentencing, Chair of the Bench Clive Powell said it was the worst case he had seen in 30 years. 'My stomach churned when I saw the pictures provided by the RSPCA,' he said. 'It is the court judgment that the totality of the offending and culpability mean that nothing sort an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate. Their water supplies were so dirty they had turned black and many of the animals suffered infected eyes, rotting teeth and ulcers as they lay in their own faeces. 'Between us we have 60 years experience, 30 years myself. 'I don't recall in that near?y 30 years any office as serious as this involving so many animals in such a poor state.' The court heard how police officers first visited the couple's home in Montacute, Somerset, on May 6 last year. Matthew Knight, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'Mr Handing was reluctant to let police into the property. 'The officers noted the poor quality of the house and abandoned their search on health and safety grounds.' Police returned with the RSPCA on June 30 and found similar conditions. 'In general the interior was filthy,' said Mr Knight. 'There was an overpowering smell of ammonia that is a product of wee. 'A number of officers had to leave the property due to the smell. The hallway of this property was was covered in dirt, hair and faeces. 'The living room - little natural light with puddles of urine on the floor. 'There was a very small window ajar. This seemed to be the only form of ventilation. The pair were each sentenced to 12 weeks in prison at Taunton Magistrates Court in Somerset after pleading guilty to a total of 28 charges of animal neglect. 'There was a room at the back called the cat room. 'Six cats were found. They seemed frightened and lived inside old chairs. 'The windowsill was covered in faeces.' However, during interview Mrs Harding said she believed the animals were 'fit and well'. Clive Rees, mitigating, said that Mrs Harding genuinely thought she was looking after the animals while Mr Harding had tried to distance himself from the situation. He said: 'The pair did not inflict anything on the animals that they did not inflict on themselves. 'Clearly they were having to live in the premises and were blind to the fact it was in such a mess. 'Their intention was to look after the animals but the care of the animals was not adequate.' Mr Harding was found guilty of all 16 offences on February 11 - 13 of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and three of failing to meet needs of the animals. Mrs Harding pleaded guilty to 12 charges on December 16 - nine of causing unnecessary suffering and three of failing to meet the needs of the animals. The couple were also banned from keeping animals for life and also banned from contesting the order for 10 years. Many of the animals have since been rehomed thanks to the RSPCA.\u00a0An appeal against the sentence has already been lodged but bail was denied while it is processed."}

Deila wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with Ajax for their development and production of young talent. That, he says, will enable Celtic to tempt the elite young stars in European football to Scotland. The Celtic manager\u2019s goal is to close out this season with a domestic Treble, then make the additions capable of helping the squad through the Champions League qualifying rounds. However, it is unlikely that Deila will be throwing a few million pounds to secure any eye-catching signing that would raise supporter expectations ahead of that late summer campaign. Ronny Deila (centre) wants to implement the same youth production standards as Ajax in the future. He explained: \u2018We will bring in players but I think we will bring in younger players to build the next generation behind the current one. \u2018If we are going to fight with the best clubs in Europe for the best 22-year-olds, then you can forget it.

While Celtic would not stand a chance of tempting him to Scotland when Spanish, German or English giants are scrapping for his signature, Deila believes less precocious talent than Odegaard can be mined then nurtured into better long-term prospects under him. \u2018There are players there, maybe not at Odegaard level, but close,\u2019 said Deila. \u2018With a good development, they can be past Odegaard if he makes the wrong decisions and we make the right ones.\u2019 Deila played a vital role in Martin Odegaard's rise to stardom when he was Stromsgodset manager."}

Efforts to break into Apple products by government security. researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple. introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of. the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said. The Intercept today cited documents obtained from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured). \u00a0It said the latest documents, which covered a period from2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligenc eresearchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding. Breaching Apple security was part of a top-secret programme. by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence. researchers, to hack'secure communications products, both. foreign and domestic' including Google Android phones, it added. Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months. sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that. their products have not become tools for widespread government. surveillance of citizens. Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for. data stored on iPhones. It claimed the changes meant the company no. longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even. if a government ordered it to with a search warrant. Silicon. Valley rival Google said shortly afterward that it. also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools. What is a 'backdoor'? A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection. Should you be worried if you use an Apple device? Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit. So far there has been no evidence that they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack. How would could the government potentially make use of these backdoors? Backdoors can provide access to unencrypted information even if users have chosen to encrypt the data they back up. Data can include the user's address book, stored photos, the voicemail database and any accounts configured on the device. What are the main concerns? Earlier this year, security expert Jonathan Zdziarski focused on three particular services known by the technical names com.apple.pcapd, com.apple.mobile.file_relay and com.apple.mobile.house_arrest that are a cause for concern. How do these hidden files work? The pcapd service starts a 'packet sniffer' on an iOS device which records all data traffic to and from your iPhone. It's installed by default on all iOS devices and gives the user no warning when it's activated. The file_relay service exists to sweep up large volumes of raw data from particular sources on an iPhone, and then release it in unencrypted form. These include the address book, accounts, GPS logs, photos, notes, calendar files, call history, voicemail and other records. The third service, house_arrest, originally allowed iTunes to copy documents to third-party apps. Now, as reported in ReadWrite, house_arrest has access to wider app-related data, including photos, databases, screenshots and temporary 'cached' information. More information about Apple's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm's support pages. Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the. privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a. response to wide-scale U.S. government spying on internet users. revealed by Snowden in 2013. An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by chief executive Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further. 'I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked. with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor. in any of our products or services,' Cook wrote in a statement. on privacy and security published last year.

{"abstract": "The US military is evacuating the last of its forces from Yemen due to the deteriorating security situation. The country is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and hundreds of members of the terrorist group have recently escaped from two Yemeni prisons. The US has been working with Yemen's government to fight AQAP, but the rise of the Houthis and other militant groups has complicated the situation.", "article": "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The U.S. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 Special Operations forces members from the Al Anad airbase in Yemen due to that country's deteriorating security situation, sources in the region familiar with the situation told CNN. Those being evacuated are the last American troops stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. \"Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,\" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of \"partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government\" as the best approach in a bad situation. \"The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,\" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the \"coup\" that led to his departure from Aden. \"The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,\" he said. Needless to say, the Houthis aren't convinced. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. \"We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,\" Al Bukhaiti said. \"Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow.\" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta."}

Researchers have developed a way of turning  so-called 'packing peanuts' (pictured) into carbon, which can then be added to the kinds of lithium batteries in everyday gadgets. During tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store around 15% more power than current technology. This breakthrough was made by Dr Vilas Pol, Dr Vinodkumar Etacheri and their colleagues at Purdue University. They presented their findings at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600\u00b0C (1,100\u00b0F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. These sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mAh per gram. By comparison, an iPhone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mAh and weighs 0.9oz (28 grams), while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g. This means the packing peanut technology could make batteries smaller and lighter, yet more powerful. Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200\u00b0C (4,100\u00b0F), meaning Dr Pol's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly. Dr Pol got the idea to turn these peanuts into nanoparticles and microsheets when he was taking delivery of new equipment for his lab. 'I looked at the packing peanuts and thought that while we are exploring \"green\" technologies, we should not be harming the environment by throwing them away,' he said. The researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600\u00b0C (1,100\u00b0F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. These sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mAh per gram. By comparison, an iPhone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mAh and weighs 0.9oz (28 grams), while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g.

These blocks were then flattened into microsheets (pictured) and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. Drs\u00a0Pol and Etacheri then tested the microsheets and nanoparticles as anodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The lithium ions move between the electrodes during charging and discharging and the researchers said their anode works so well 'it outperforms commercial [anodes], with a storage capacity higher than graphite, a typical anode material.' And although the higher temperatures used to create other sheets create a more layered arrangement of carbon atoms to maximise  performance, Dr Pol's less-ordered materials are said to have a 15 per cent higher electrical storage capacity. Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200\u00b0C (4,100\u00b0F), which creates more structured sheets.

The duo competed for the ball and momentum appeared to take them into the advertising boards. Mr Leatherbarrow told the\u00a0Liverpool Echo: 'The way I saw it Smalling sort of shoved Mario off the pitch and Mario grabbed him just to have something to grab on to. 'I could tell from Mario\u2019s body language he was ready to react and I knew he\u2019d already had a yellow card. 'I was saying \"calm down, leave it, leave it and he was saying \u2018OK, OK\".

She was found in her car seat, which may have saved her life, and was rushed to the hospital where she was revived. Her father, Deven Trafny, was out of town at the time of the accident, but rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard and has been by her side ever since.", "article": "(CNN)\"There's a baby. There's a baby.\" The frantic voices of rescuers can be heard on the body cam video showing the moment baby Lily was found one week ago. The 18-month-old girl hangs upside down after her mother's car crashed and flipped into a frigid Utah river some 14 hours earlier. A firefighter is seen lifting her tiny body, wrapped in pink, from the red car where Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, lost her life. The car landed on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. From the murky waters, the rescuer hands baby Lily to a police officer. He dashes up the rocky banks of the Spanish Fork, pressing the infant close to his chest for warmth. \"Got it,\" the officer is heard saying. Lily is freezing. \"Come on, baby,\" he says. \"She's definitely hypothermic.\" In the ambulance, the officer pats little Lily on the back in an attempt to get her breathing. Lily is on her side. She looks pale, her tiny arm appears stiff. \"Come on, sweetie,\" the officer implores. \"Come on, sweetie.\" On the ambulance to a hospital, rescuers perform CPR. They try to warm her. \"We're almost there,\" one rescuer is heard to say. \"Are you getting a pulse?\" \"I can't feel anything,\" says another. At the hospital, as Lily is rushed into the emergency room, she vomits. \"We've been doing CPR on her,\" the officer tells emergency room personnel. \"She's been throwing up a little bit.\" Those moments captured by the body cam video -- which first aired on CNN affiliate KSL -- were crucial. \"If anything had been different, she might not have made it,\" emergency room doctor Brock Royall told the station. In the ER, Lily opened her eyes as CPR was performed to get her heart pumping, Royall said. Another important factor was a car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age, and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside-down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but even more dangerous if the baby had gotten wet. \"She seems to be doing great,\" said Officer Jason Howard of the Spanish Fork Police Department. \"We were able to get together with her and her family. She was happy and smiling. Seemed to be a normal and happy, healthy baby.\" Howard said the toddler temporarily was staying with an aunt and uncle. Her father, Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. \"(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home.\" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. \"She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,\" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot last Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: \"I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that.\" But he also considers himself lucky to still have his daughter -- healthy and alive. \"I'm just blessed. I'm counting all my blessings right now,\" said Trafny.

Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo scored a double to help Club Brugge progress with a 5-2 aggregate win over Besiktas. The 19-year-old cousin of Romelu Lukaku came off the bench to punish the Turkish side who were pushing for a winner. Tom de Sutter had earlier taken advantage of some lax goalkeeping to add to his goal from the 2-1 win in the first leg, meaning Ramon's fine strike for the Turkish side was merely a memory by the time the final whistle blew - with Besiktas down to 10 men after the late loss of Olcay Sahan. An angry Besiktas fan confronts Slaven Bilic (centre) after his side were beaten by Club Brugge in Turkey. The supporter was held back by security and a member of Bilic's coaching staff before being led away. Bilic was no pushover in his playing days and the former West Ham man was known for his passion. Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo (centre) rounds Tolga Zengin to score for Club Brugge and put them through. Lukaku's cousin clearly turned a few heads after his impressive cameo performance off the bench. Brilliant Fiorentina stunned Roma with an early goal blitz to seal their spot in the quarter-finals at the expense of their Italian rivals. Roma might have held a narrow advantage after drawing the first leg 1-1 in Florence but any hopes of progressing were sunk inside 21 minutes on Thursday as Gonzalo Rodriguez, Marcos Alonso and Jose Maria Basanta all netted for Fiorentina. Sorry Roma finished with 10 men following Adem Ljajic's late dismissal. Jose Maria Basanta celebrates after scoring the third goal for Fiorentina as they eased past Roma. Sevilla remain on course to retain their title after easing past fellow Spanish side Villarreal. Having done most of the damage with a 3-1 first leg win at El Madrigal, Sevilla finished things off at home with a 2-1 victory courtesy of second-half goals from Vicente Iborra and his replacement Denis Suarez. Villarreal had netted in-between those strikes through Giovani dos Santos' fine free-kick but almost immediately had centre-back Eric Bailly sent off as they tumbled out 5-2 on aggregate. On-loan Barcelona player Denis Suarez (centre) heads home the winning goal against ten-man Villarreal. Napoli are also through after a hard-fought goalless draw against Dinamo Moscow in Russia. The Italians held a 3-1 lead from the first leg and that proved sufficient as they survived a second-leg onslaught from Stanislav Cherchesov's men. Zenit St Petersburg qualified for the quarters despite going down 1-0 to a late headed goal from Torino's Kamil Gilk at the Stadio Olimpico. Zenit arrived for the second leg in Italy with a two-goal cushion, and it proved just enough for Andre Villas-Boas' team to progress after a bruising encounter. Kamil Glik (right) heads home the winner for Torino but it wasn't enough to see them go through. Finally, Yevhen Konoplyanka's extra-time score booked Dnipro's spot on away goals after they claimed a 2-2 aggregate 'win' over Ajax. Riechedly Bazoer fired Ajax ahead in the 60th minute and levelled the tie at 1-1 after Dnipro had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg, however neither side could find a winning goal before the 90 minutes were up, meaning the game went into extra-time. Dnipro took the advantage when Konoplyanka calmly broke to the left edge of Ajax's box before unleashing a shot which found the bottom right corner, meaning that Mike van der Hoorn's goal late in extra time served little purpose. Yevhen Konoplyanka (10) fires home the winner deep into extra-time to put Dnipro into the quarters."}

A British boxing promoter has been found dead in Monaco after going missing two weeks ago. Michael Graydon, 29, from Stockwood, Bristol, became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse nightclub on February 21, and was last seen on CCTV at about 1.30am. The father-of-one was in the principality  to watch a boxing match featuring Bristol fighter and friend, Lee Haskins. But he never made it to the event and missed his flight home, prompting a major police search around harbours and marinas nearby. The body was found today 'behind a little church' in the Sainte Devote area of Monaco, close to where he was last seen, a Monaco government spokeswoman confirmed. Genevieve Berti, deputy director of the Monaco Media Bureau, said: 'We can confirm on the death of a British national - Michael Graydon, who had previously been reported missing, in Monaco. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Ms Berti added that footage showed Mr Graydon climbing over the wall of a property and said it is believed that he then fell. She added that the body was unrecognisable due to be in an advanced state of decomposition, but tattoos on the arms were'really comparable' to the ones described by his family. He was also carrying his driving licence, which confirmed the name of Michael Graydon. Ms Berti said the death is not being treated as suspicious, adding that no one else can be seen in the CCTV images. Following his disappearance a 12-strong group of close family and friends travelled to central Monaco to hand out leaflets and meet police and legal officials. The father-of-one, pictured left with son Reuben, had been in Monaco to watch a boxing match featuring friend Lee Haskins when he disappeared after a night out clubbing. He became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse night club and was last seen on CCTV at 1.36am. The former boxer missed the match he was due to watch and flight home, prompting a huge police search. Stacey Marie Jones, a close friend, described Mr Graydon as 'the kind of man who would do anything for anybody'. Speaking before today's discovery, she said: 'He is such a family man and such a mother's boy that we knew that when he had not been in contact with his mother that something was wrong. 'We are not leaving Monaco and we are not going to stop until we have answers and until he is back home with us - whether that be in body or in spirit. 'He has a two-year-old son, Reuben, who will need answers. We do not believe that anyone can go missing in Monaco and no-one would know what happened to him.' Well-wishers raised \u00a315,000 since Tuesday to help fund the search and hire lawyers in Monaco, while members of the public held a march in Bristol to support his family and friends. A message posted on a social media page, set up to help find Mr Graydon, said today: 'From the family and friends of Michael, thank you for the support and messages over the last weeks. It meant so much.' After his disappearance a group of 12 family and friends flew to Monaco to start searching for him themselves. They set up a social media page and gave out flyers in a bid to find Mr Graydon - described as a family man.

Chauffeur Awad Abdulbagy, 48, found the images on cameras and USB sticks during a visit by the royal family to London in May 2013. Abdulbagy and wife Nasren Mohammed, 34, boasted they could sell the photos to TV stations and enemies of the country and demanded a \u2018reward\u2019 through the nation\u2019s embassy in Mayfair. Plot: Chauffeur Awad Abdulbagy, 48, and his wife, Nasren Mohammed, 34, both pictured outside Southwark Crown Court today. The couple face jail after being found guilty of blackmailing the Qatari royal family. The victim of the plot cannot be named, but Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Hajri told jurors it was a'very sensitive' situation. Abdulbagy and Mohammed, both from west London, were found guilty at Southwark Crown Court today. A third defendant, Syrian-born Khaled Watter, 50, also from London, was cleared. Mr Al-Hajri told the court: 'It is very natural that these are shameful, they are private photographs. 'There are so many enemies of Qatar and these are private photos and you know that can be really very bad in our society - we are very conservative.' Prosecutor Gareth Patterson said Qatar is a 'particularly wealthy state' and explained members of the royal family and the household often come to the UK. On the trip in May 2013 there were not enough of the regular drivers, so self-employed Abdulbagy was given the job and drove a hired Mercedes E Class, jurors heard. Abdulbagy ferried the official photographer for the family around London and took him to Stanstead Airport at the end of the stay. Negotiation: Diplomat\u00a0Ali Al-Hajri, pictured outside court today, said it was a'very sensitive' situation. \u2018It was sometime during that period  that the defendant Mr Abdulbagy came into possession of camera equipment,\u2019 said Mr Patterson. On the day the photographer left, Abdulbagy made the first of a series of phone calls to the embassy to try and 'extract' money for the images. The prosecution had alleged that Mr Watter was involved in the calls. Abdulbagy described the photos as being \u2018like treasure\u2019 and demanded a \u2018present or reward\u2019. \u2018He said he didn\u2019t have a house, didn\u2019t have any money, said he wanted to do it in the halal way -or the clean way - and he spoke about the value of the photographs,\u2019 said Mr Patterson. At the embassy he was handed a \u2018settlement deed\u2019 which he signed agreeing to hand over the cameras and memory sticks in the hope of a \u2018finders fee\u2019. But he broke the terms of the legal contract and retained a camera, later taunting the diplomat by sending him a photo of it. Mohammed even text her husband to say she had \u2018got a back up\u2019 of the snaps. Mr Al-Hajri told the jury that when he spoke to the couple, Abdulbagy made it clear he wanted money. He said: 'At the beginning it was obvious they wanted money for these photos and naturally my role was to discuss with them, you know what they wanted. 'When I ask them what it is they exactly want and what do they have he said that they wanted to finish the matter in return for some money. 'I asked them how much do they want, he said \u00a3600,000 and then I was surprised so I repeated the question, he said \u00a3300,000.' He added that Abdulbagy also sent him threatening messages in Arabic. \u2018The wording is very clear when he says \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait any longer\u201d - this is clear blackmail,\u2019 he said. Abdulbagy \u2018applied pressure in his desire to extract money\u2019, said Mr Patterson. He then resumed the campaign for cash, sending messages and making telephone calls. Abdulbagy and Wattar were arrested following a third and final meeting at the embassy. A search of a car parked at the nearby Dorchester Hotel revealed the missing items. Sudanese national Abdulbagy denied theft and Mohammed denied a further charge of handling stolen goods. Not guilty pleas were entered to both charges following a direction by the judge. Abdulbagy and Mohammed will be sentenced on 1 May. Facing jail: Abdulbagy and Mohammed were both found guilty at Southwark Crown Court today."}
{"abstract": "Jose Mourinho has been successful in reducing spending at Chelsea while still bringing success, such as winning the Capital One Cup. He has done this by selling players like Juan Mata and Romelu Lukaku for a profit and signing players like Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas. Mourinho has also taken advantage of Tottenham's misfortune to prepare for the final, and his team is now built around a young group of stars like Eden Hazard.", "article": "When Jose Mourinho returned to English football in 2013, he produced a pair of spectacles from his pocket to claim it was the only thing that had changed in six years away from Chelsea. This time Mourinho has read the small print, carrying out Roman Abramovich\u2019s vision for his club to be self-financing and operating within UEFA\u2019s strict Financial Fair Play guidelines. They were rather more gung-ho in 2004, spraying money around Europe to sign some of the best talent in the game to make sure Chelsea cleaned up in Mourinho\u2019s first three seasons at Stamford Bridge. From July 1, 2004 to July 20, 2004, Abramovich splashed \u00a389million on seven players \u2014 including Petr Cech, Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba \u2014 in a whirlwind shopping spree. They finished the season with the title. Jose Mourinho won his first trophy since returning to England when Chelsea beat Tottenham on Sunday. The Portuguese manager has reduced spending at the club but has continued to bring success. Players like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have been brought to the club and proved a huge success. On Sunday evening, less than half an hour after John Terry had lifted the Capital One Cup, Chelsea\u2019s manager claimed the club are now operating in the \u2018third tier\u2019 of clubs. Financial Fair Play has become something of a hobby horse of Mourinho in recent months. He highlights the money-no-object strategies of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain while emphasising how Chelsea are working within strict, fiscal parameters. \u2018There are teams who don\u2019t care about FFP and are punished, but they play,\u2019 he added. \u2018Then there is a group, which Chelsea are in, the group who care about FFP.\u2019 Last week, City manager Manuel Pellegrini did not have the confidence to start Eliaquim Mangala, who cost \u00a332m last summer, alongside captain Vincent Kompany against Barcelona. After Chelsea collected the Capital One Cup, a trophy City won last season, Mourinho referred to \u00a311m signing Kurt Zouma, 20, as his \u2018Marcel Desailly\u2019 after a mature performance alongside Ramires in midfield. Whichever way you look at it, the numbers add up for Mourinho as he turns his attention to winning his third Premier League title. Chelsea sold defender David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for a staggering \u00a350million last summer. Juan Mata was a star player for Chelsea but when Mourinho arrived he sold him to Manchester United. Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku was sold to Everton for \u00a328m, giving Chelsea a considerable profit. The average age of his Chelsea team at Wembley on Sunday was 27 years and three months compared to the 28 of City, beaten 2-1 by Liverpool at Anfield earlier in the day. And Mourinho\u2019s squad looks the better long-term bet. Once a player has worn that blue shirt, there is an automatic premium, as Mourinho has used to great effect, whenever he decides to move them on. They made a profit of about \u00a318m on Romelu Lukaku, who made just 10 Premier League appearances for Chelsea, when he was sold to Everton before the start of the season. Juan Mata was moved on to Manchester United for \u00a337m and David Luiz went to PSG for \u00a350m. All three, among others, were astute business decisions. In return he signed Diego Costa, who played in last season\u2019s Champions League final for Atletico Madrid, and Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona. Good business all round. At this point it would be remiss not to mention Chelsea\u2019s record shirt sponsorship deal with a tyre manufacturer, which rolls in next season, or their claim that they have 500m fans around the world. Some of them were fortunate enough to be at Wembley as their side beat London rivals Tottenham 2-0 to claim the first meaningful trophy of the season. Mourinho is building a team around a young group of stars like Belgium international Eden Hazard. Chelsea recently announced a new lucrative sponsorship deal with Japanese company Yokohama. The new lucrative endorsement is double the amount of the clubs current sponsors Samsung. Mourinho prepared for the final like a battleship commander, wisely using the eight days he had with his squad after the 1-1 draw with Burnley in the Premier League on February 21. Mourinho took advantage of Tottenham\u2019s misfortune, a team who had just one full training session following Thursday\u2019s elimination from the Europa League to prepare for Sunday\u2019s showpiece. It was an important win for Mourinho, highlighted by the manager\u2019s celebrations with his assistant Rui Faria in the technical area. \u2018As you know, this country is very difficult,\u2019 he added. \u2018If you look at how difficult it is to qualify for the Champions League, you can imagine how difficult it is to win the Premier League. \u2018We are speaking about Chelsea, City,"}

The Poland international is expected to feature in the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United on Monday night, provided he recovers from the virus which stopped him from being on the bench for the midweek Barclays Premier League win at QPR. Szczesny, 24, has not started a league game since the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, where he was culpable for the goals and afterwards was also caught smoking in the showers.

'From the time Wojciech got into the Arsenal first team there were a lot who asked if he was good enough and I thought, \"this boy has the potential to really be a solid, outstanding goalkeeper\". I still believe that because he is - for his position - still relatively young,' Wilson said. 'All I would a say to him is \"look, Arsenal is one of the greatest football clubs. If you go from here I am not sure you are ever going to get a club as good as this. At your age now you need to dedicate yourself to being the best you can be, to the exclusion of a lot of other things in your life\".' Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson says\u00a0Szczesny must work hard to regain his place in the team. Ospina has made the most of his opportunity, tying down the No 1 goalkeeping position at the Emirates. Wilson recalled: 'I was a very late starter, but once I was in the Arsenal side, my family almost came second to my ambition. 'I devoted every moment to regular training and then when the boys went in for their bath, I stayed out [on the field]. 'I wanted to make sure I never ever left the game saying I could have been better, so my message to Wojciech would be \"come on, prove how good you can be\".'

'He works very hard in training, so I don't think that will be a problem.' Arsenal head to Old Trafford in search for a first win there since September 2006, but on the back of good league form. Wenger said: 'We are the holders of the FA Cup, this competition is important to us and we want to go there to produce a result.'"}

Tomasz Kuszczak saved well from Jacques Maghoma but Wednesday are left marooned in mid-table with little but pride to play for. Wolves made two changes as Scott Golbourne and Nouha Dicko replaced Kortney Hause and Henry, while Stevie May returned for Wednesday along with Maghoma and Marnick Vermijl. And the visitors threatened first as Atdhe Nuhiu and Tom Lees headed wide before Wolves took the lead in controversial fashion after 19 minutes. Dicko burst down the right and skipped past one sloppy Wednesday tackle but then went down under a soft challenge from Claude Dielna in the area and referee Simon Hooper gave a penalty. The forward looked to have fallen easily but Sako sent Keiren Westwood the wrong way from the spot for his 12th goal of the season. James Henry runs to the crowd after finishing off the scoring with a stunning effort after 67 minutes. Maghoma fired at Kuszczak as the visitors tried to respond before Westwood saved well after Kevin McDonald squeezed in behind the Wednesday defence. And the keeper had to be at his best again on 31 minutes when he turned Dicko's 20-yard effort wide. A minute later and Jack Price shot straight at Westwood as Wednesday were once again opened up, this time by the lively Rajiv van La Parra. The winger fired home from the edge of the area and gave Kieran Westwood no chance of saving it. But Kuszczak kept Wolves ahead 10 minutes before the break when he clawed away Maghoma's header. The Wednesday striker had been their biggest threat and he shot just wide after the restart before Nuhiu headed over. Wolves' slow start gave the visitors encouragement but the hosts doubled their lead out of nothing on 55 minutes. Sako (centre) was a danger throughout and scored the opener from the spot but could have had more. Matt Doherty wriggled free on the right and crossed for the unmarked Afobe to thump a volley in off the post from 12 yards. With that Wednesday crumbled and Henry made it 3-0 12 minutes later with a classy strike when he cut inside and curled into the top corner from 20 yards. It was game over but Wolves suffered a blow when Richard Stearman was carried off on a stretcher with 16 minutes left after appearing to go down under little pressure to dampen their night."}

An incredible road map of the Universe revealing the pathways between our Milky Way (red dot) and 100,000 other far away galaxies has been revealed. The gigantic super-cluster of stars, planets and asteroids, which stretches 500 million light years across and has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns, has been named Laniakea. The astonishing discovery has revealed that the Milky Way (red dot) - home to Earth and our solar system - is on the fringes of the enormous cosmic web. The vast road map may look as though it is densely packed, however there are vast expanses of darkness where nothing can be found for hundreds of light years. Our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity as the groups make their way through space. Scientists have long-known that galaxies are not distributed randomly but congregate together in clusters.\u00a0When these clusters meet in the cosmos, they create giant superclusters, like Laniakea. To put the sheer size of the supercluster into context, the Earth is the third planet from our Sun, which is one of just billions of stars within the Milky Way. Other than being our home, our galaxy is nothing special and is one of around 100,000 within our supercluster. And even though the collection of bright galaxies is incomprehensibly large, it makes up just a corner of the observable Universe. Within Laniakea, galaxies flow inwards towards a region called the Great Attractor, the equivalent of a large gravitational valley. Our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity. The vast road map may look as though it is densely packed, however there are vast expanses of darkness where nothing can be found for hundreds of light years. The astronomers compared the movement of the galaxies with that of water among hills and valleys to chart the supercluster. Dr Brent Tully, from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, led the team of scientists that mapped Laniakea's boundaries. Around our supercluster are four others - known as Shapley, Hercules, Coma and Perseus-Pisces - however it is difficult to show exactly where our neighbourhood of galaxies ends and the others begin. Dr Brent Tully, from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, led the team of scientists that mapped Laniakea's boundaries from measurements of the velocities of local galaxies. The researchers compared the galactic movement with that of water in a landscape of hills and valleys, tracing the outer surface of a region where the net-motion of galaxies was inward. They wrote in the journal Nature: 'We define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster, which we call Laniakea.'"}

Authorities have not yet determined the cause of death, but are investigating the possibility of a suicide or a lynching. The FBI, Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division are all looking into the case.", "article": "Port Gibson, Mississippi (CNN)An African-American man is found hanging from a tree in the Mississippi woods with bedsheets around his neck attached to a limb 15 feet above the ground. There's no chair in sight. His feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground. His hands are not bound. Is this a suicide? Or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the South's history of racial violence re-emerging? Those were the big questions Friday, one day after authorities found a man's body with bedsheets around his neck in Port Gibson, a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural Claiborne County, about 60 miles southwest of Jackson, the state capital. Evidence collected so far doesn't suggest foul play in the death, law enforcement officials said. For that reason, suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death, the officials said. Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas on Friday identified the man as Otis Byrd. Even though authorities have confirmed his name, they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how Byrd died and who is responsible. \"It could take a week, it could take two weeks, it could take months,\" Lucas said. Authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused Byrd's death, Donald Alway, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Jackson, said Friday afternoon at a press conference. He said 30 agents from the FBI, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim \"that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of Mr. Byrd.\" Agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a \"storage location\" Byrd owned that might yield information, Alway said. Alway said the FBI is communicating with the family and won't comment on rumors circulating about the death. \"The community deserves answers,\" he said. \"The family deserves answers.\" The body was found at 10:21 a.m. Thursday, deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house Byrd was renting, according to Lucas. A skullcap had been pulled over his head, the sheriff said. That house was the last place where Byrd had been seen on March 2, according to the sheriff. He was reported missing a week later, spurring a search. The body was found by staffers from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks who were taking part in the search, Lucas said. Thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found, according to the sheriff. A family member who did not want to be identified said Byrd was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing. He went to church, he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino, according to the family member, who described Byrd as a \"good, hardworking man.\" Byrd had been in prison. He was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman, but was paroled in 2006, according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. No one has given any indication publicly whether Byrd had enemies. What distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching? Thomas Martin, a veteran crime scene investigator and president of Crime Scene Forensics LLC, said he knew nothing about the Mississippi case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation. Injuries to the dead person indicate lynching, he said, because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged. When people are strangled by somebody else, investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck, he said. The direction of the ligature is another indicator, Martin said. When people hang themselves, the rope often rides up directly behind the ears, he said. When a person is hanged by other people, the ligature moves differently on the neck, he said. Martin said these are general observations and that \"the facts are what make or break the case.\" Mississippi NAACP chapter President Derrick Johnson issued a statement calling on \"federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of Mr. Otis Byrd.\" The FBI already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi are also investigating, according to a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation also is investigating. FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jason Pack told WAPT that \"it's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner\" of death. \"We don't know what happened out there,\" Pack said. \"We don't know if it was a suicide, if it was a homicide. That's why we investigate these types of cases.\" Lucas, who is himself African-American, said Friday that he's worried people will jump to the conclusion that Byrd was murdered and that race was a factor. \"I don't want the community to go excited saying it was a white-on"}

On March 16, 2015, Jordan Henderson scored a second-half winner for Liverpool at Swansea, setting them up for a showdown with Manchester United for the final spot in the Champions League. Liverpool have been in good form since December 14, with Henderson leading the team with distinction and scoring in his last three Premier League games.", "article": "March 16, 2014. Liverpool travel away from Anfield for a game that will shape the destiny of their season and Brendan Rodgers' confidence is telling. 'If we beat them, they cannot do it,' Rodgers proclaims ahead of a trip to Old Trafford. He had just been asked what the consequences would be if Manchester United, who were trying desperately to keep pace in the race for the Champions League, lost to Liverpool. His words are backed up by a swaggering display, full of devilment, wit and counter-attacking menace. Manchester United are left punch-drunk by a 3-0 defeat that could have been even heavier, as Steven Gerrard \u2013 with two pressure penalties \u2013 and Luis Suarez ran amok. Steven Gerrard scored two penalties as Liverpool won 3-0 at Manchester United on March 16, 2014. Luis Suarez (bottom) was also on the scoresheet as Liverpool built a 14-point gap over their arch-rivals. Liverpool headed home that afternoon with a 14-point gap over their rivals in the Barclays Premier League and had effectively destroyed any lingering hope that David Moyes had of commandeering a top four spot. It was a day when Rodgers saw his players make a massive statement of intent, a day that suggested there was a shift in the balance of power of this rivalry; leaving Old Trafford then, you felt it would be a long time before the deficit would be clawed back. Fast forward to March 16, 2015. Again Liverpool were away from Anfield for a vital fixture and again Rodgers' confidence in the build-up was telling but, this time, there was no performance of verve and invention to back up his pre-game message. There was, however, doggedness, determination and the result was just as crucial. Jordan Henderson's freak goal, coming after they had spent much of a rain-sodden night in South Wales riding their luck and defending for their lives, has set them up for another afternoon of destiny with their most bitter foe. Jordan Henderson scored a second-half winner for Liverpool as they won 1-0 at Swansea on Monday night. Henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved Liverpool within two points of the top four. Henderson's (right) shot was deflected over the top of Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and into the net. The goal was Henderson's (right) third in the last three Premier League games for Liverpool. No trophy will be presented at Anfield next Sunday but there is the sense that the winner of Liverpool and Manchester United's latest showdown will take all in relation to the final spot in next year's Champions League. It is going to be another day of reckoning. Do not underestimate how much Liverpool needed this result at the Liberty Stadium. They have stylishly worked their way into contention for the top four with a long unbeaten run but United's victory over Tottenham had threatened to alter the landscape. What if a loss in Wales and had then be follow up with a defeat at Anfield? Such a scenario would have left bleak consequences for Liverpool. Those result would have left them with an eight-point deficit and not enough time to claw it back, especially with some tricky assignments looming. As it is, they go into English football's Clasico brimming with confidence, two points behind United but ready to leapfrog Louis van Gaal's men. They will need to step up on what they produced against Swansea to topple United but Rodgers has a glint in his eye and faith in his team. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (centre) tries to wriggle away from a challenge from Swansea's Jack Cork. Liverpool might not have last year's electric swagger but they certainly know how to fight and, in some ways, the results they have put together since losing at Old Trafford on December 14 have been just as impressive as their unexpected title-charge. Nobody proved that determination more than Henderson, who emerged from a difficult first 45 minutes to keep on running and score the decisive goal, his challenge on Jordi Amat looping over Lukasz Fabianski's head to leave Rodgers' punching the air. Henderson keeps on producing these important moments. For all the noise that is being created around Raheem Sterling and his contract stand-off, the most pressing contractual issue Liverpool have is with their vice-captain. He has scored in each of his last three Premier League games and has led the team with distinction in Gerrard's absence. Young, hungry, talented English players like him are not ten-a-penny and it would be folly to let this drift. Liverpool should really get this business concluded.

The couple, who are now the proud parents to one and a half year old daughter Elena Rose, hit it off on the first date. 47-year-old Lloyd, who hails from New York, had been married before and was looking for the love of his life. He knew straight away that 38-year-old Kellie was different to the other five women he had been on dates with from the site. 'I liked the idea of eHarmony because you could put in all the information about yourself and who you are and what you\u2019re looking for in life and what your interests are,' Lloyd told Daily Mail Australia. 'I did it for about a year and I was at the end of it and starting to get discouraged a little bit because I was just going through this series of meet ups and dates and they just weren't going anywhere.

'We both wanted to meet somebody that we could fall in love with. We both wanted to get married. We both wanted to start a family. We both wanted similar life plans. 'I saw her (Kellie), she was lovely and beautiful and she was a good listener and it seemed like she was keen and was looking for the same things as I was.' Just eight months after meeting the pair got married in September 2012 and ten months after that they welcomed their baby girl Elena into the world. Kellie, who is an IT professional was interested in Kung Fu, while Lloyd, who works in Harley Davidson, was obsessed with motorcycles.

On the flipside, the top five hobbies and interests listed by women that are most likely to capture men\u2019s attention are personal growth, health and exercise, food, family and dancing. However, Kellie disputes these findings and said politics would not be on the top of her list when looking for the perfect partner. 'Politics has no effect on how I felt about anyone,' she said. 'For me it was having a varied interest. I looked at the outdoors so somebody who liked that as well. You just want to see that somebody has interest in a few different areas.' While Kellie said exercise was important, she believes some of the men on the site put too much emphasis on their physique. Kellie believes men who come across like they only have one interest are a major turn-off and show that they do not have time in their lives for anything else. 'I noticed when I was on eHarmony most of the guys would upload a photo of when they are overseas, a photo where they're exercising,' she said. 'Men will try and make themselves seem more active than they were so they would make out like they cycled all the time or  lifted weights everyday, when that\u2019s not really the truth. 'People do try and demonstrate that they have varied interests on the site. Although dating wasn't always plain sailing on the site for Kellie and Lloyd."}

However, scientists have now proposed that some worlds might be able to host life \u2018not as we know it\u2019 that thrives not on water, but on other chemicals. Specifically, they looked at Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, which has seas of liquid methane rather than water, and they it could harbour methane-based, oxygen-free forms of life. Cornell University scientists in New York have proposed a new type of life. Called an azotosome, it would survive on liquid methane rather than water - so it could live on Titan. Shown is an illustration of a nine-nanometre azotosome, the size of a virus, with a piece of the membrane cut away to show the hollow interior. The fascinating research by scientists at Cornell University in New York suggests that life in the universe may be abundant in more places than thought. The life they propose, called an azotosome, would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). No life on Earth is known to be able to survive in similar conditions. \u2018Ours is the first concrete blueprint of life not as we know it,\u2019 said graduate student James Stevenson, first author of the research. Life on our planet relies on a permeable water-based exterior - a vesicle or liposome - that houses the organic matter of every cell. As no life on Earth can survive without water, astronomers have been looking for alien life in habitable zones of stars where liquid water can exist - it is not too hot, and not too cold. But if cells could be based on methane, rather than water, they could survive in much colder climates, as methane has a much lower melting point. A study in November 2014 argued that alien species could exist on planets that contain an exotic substance known as'supercritical' carbon dioxide, rather than water. This type of CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas. Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees Kelvin (32\u00b0C) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 the standard atmosphere at sea level. On Earth, it's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment, but astrobiologists at Washington State University believe it could also be capable of sustaining life. Study co-author Professor Schulze-Makuch and his team compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water, and found that they were more stable in supercritical CO2. The life proposed by the scientists would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). This means it could survive on the surface of Titan (illustration shown), meaning more worlds might be habitable than we thought. The theoretical azotosome life form is made from nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen molecules - all of which are known to exist in the cryogenic seas of Titan. However, it shows the same stability and flexibility as comparable life on Earth. And interestingly, to create the structures, the scientists also envision the cells could use a compound called acrylonitrile, which is a strong barrier to decomposition. Acrylonitrile is a colourless, poisonous, liquid organic compound use in the manufacture of acrylic fibres and thermoplastics on Earth - and it is also present in Titan\u2019s atmosphere. Chemical Engineer Dr Paulette Clancy said the the next step is to try and demonstrate how these cells would behave in the methane environment. This includes how they might reproduce and metabolise with their oxygen-free, methane-based cells.

The furious West Brom manager also branded as \u2018mindless idiots\u2019 the hundreds of Aston Villa fans who invaded the pitch and goaded his players during Saturday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final in scenes reminiscent of the 1970s. The FA are investigating the trouble, with Villa facing a large fine or even a partial stadium closure if negligence is established. West Brom manager Tony Pulis was disappointed that fans ripped out seats at Villa Park. Pulis compared scenes with fans on the pitch at Villa Park to trouble in the 1970s. Thousands of Villa supporters celebrated their win against West Brom by storming the pitch on Saturday. Questions will be asked about the meagre number of stewards, who were overwhelmed by a rush of Villa supporters. In 2010 West Ham were fined \u00a3115,000 for failing to control their fans when violence flared at a League Cup tie against Millwall. West Brom could also face sanctions over their fans, with one Villa supporter revealing to Sportsmail that he suffered a bloody head wound caused by a seat flung down from the upper section of the North Stand. Estimates suggested up to 25 chairs had been used as weapons. Pulis said: \u2018Those supporters should never come into another ground.

{"abstract": "The Economist has calculated the value of each player's goals based on the importance of the game and the result of the goal. Despite Ronaldo's 105 goals in 2013 and 2014, Messi's 86 goals were worth more points to his team. The Economist suggests that Messi should have won the Ballon d'Or six times in a row due to the importance of his goals.", "article": "Cristiano Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he finally usurped Lionel Messi as the Ballon d\u2019Or winner for 2013. He was also officially crowned the world\u2019s best player, above Messi, for 2014. But here\u2019s the bad news, Cristiano. Despite the gongs and the widely-held opinion that Ronaldo was superior to his great rival over the past two years, Messi still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014. That is the view of the number-crunchers at The Economist, who have calculated the worth of each player's goals, based on how crucial the goal was to the match result (and the subsequent gains from that result), as well as the importance of the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) in action during last Sunday's El Clasico duel. Messi's Barcelona beat Ronaldo's Real Madrid 2-1 at the Nou Camp, with the Portuguese scoring. The explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated, so to read them in full click here. Sportsmail\u2019s calculator also seems to be broken, so again to see the full numbers, let The Economists\u2019s boffins guide you through. Be warned, though: the introduction contains a reference to 'The Pythagorean Formula Extended for Soccer', so it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted. But the key facts are these. Messi\u2019s (still fantastic) total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with Ronaldo's superhuman 105. Ronaldo shed tears of joy when he won the Ballon d'Or over Messi in 2013. The Real Madrid hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the Champions League final last season. But Ronaldo's penalty against Atletico Madrid was virtually worthless, according to The Economist. Each of Ronaldo\u2019s 105 goals, however, were worth an average of 0.40 points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored. By contrast, Messi\u2019s 86 goals were worth an average of 0.47 points each. And if that sounds like gobbledegook, essentially this can be explained in simple terms: a goal in a match where the score is tied 1-1 in the final minutes yields more points (or aggregate value in cup ties) to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player's team is already winning 3-1. The Economist uses Ronaldo\u2019s three goals in the semi-final and final of last year\u2019s Champions League as an example to show their relative lack of value. In the second leg of the semi-final against Bayern Munich, Ronaldo scored when Real led 3-0 and 4-0 on aggregate. And in the final against Atletico Madrid, his penalty in extra-time when Madrid were 3-1 ahead had a virtually negligible value. Messi has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to Ronaldo since 2013. Messi is on international duty with Argentina and is pictured here training in Washington. Messi was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but Ronaldo walked off with the prize. The importance of Messi's goals means he should have claimed the big prize six times, says The Economist. Messi, however, scored a winning goal in the final 20 minutes of a match on five different occasions in 2013 and 2014, which hands him the advantage over Ronaldo. The Economist suggests that the only reason that the Argentina star has not claimed six Ballon d\u2019Ors in a row is \u2018Messi fatigue\u2019. If you've got a spare week or so, a working abacus and Carol Vorderman available for a chat, you could try to prove them wrong\u2026."}

The chemicals, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can cause short-term health effects and long-term health effects such as an increased risk of cancer, liver damage, kidney damage and damage to the nervous system. The most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes, which react quickly with ozone to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles.", "article": "Many consumers buy 'green' or organic household products in the belief they are safer and kinder to the environment. But many of these products also contain cancer-causing chemicals, a new study has warned. Australian researchers found that common products marketed as \u2018green\u2019, \u2018all-natural\u2019, \u2018non-toxic\u2019 and \u2018organic\u2019 emit compounds that could harm health and air quality. At this time, consumer products sold in Australia, the US and around the world are not required to list all ingredients, or any ingredients in a chemical mixture called 'fragrance'. This means consumers cannot check what the item contains and whether it is potentially dangerous. Household items marketed as 'green', 'organic', 'all-natural\u2019 and \u2018non-toxic\u2019 could still emit compounds that damage health, a study has warned. The researchers analysed 37 different products, such as air fresheners, cleaning products, laundry supplies and personal care products found all over the world, including those that claimed to be \u2018green\u2019 or \u2018organic\u2019. Then, they investigated the number of volatile organic compounds (VOC) the products emitted. VOCs are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air at room temperature. They can cause short term health effects including irritating the throat and mouth, causing dizziness and can make conditions like asthma worse. In the long term, exposure to these compounds has been linked with an increased risk of cancer, liver damage, kidney damage and damage to the nervous system. The reseachers found 156 different VOCs emitted from the products, with an average of 15 VOCs per product. Of these 156 VOCs, 42 are classified as toxic or hazardous under US federal laws, and each product emitted at least one of these chemicals. They found the cancer-causing pollutants were found in many of the fragranced \u2018green\u2019 products. And they were just as damaging as those from regular chemical products that aren't marketed as organic, researchers said. The most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes, which were not in fragrance-free versions. Researchers analysed 37 household products and found they all emitted volatile organic compounds (pictured). These are chemicals that get into the air easily and have been linked with cancer and liver damage. Terpenes react very quickly with ozone (a pale blue gas found in the air) to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles, the researchers said. The researchers also warned that fewer than three per cent were disclosed product labels or product information. Lead author Professor Anne Steinman, of Melbourne School of Engineering, said this means the public is unable to check which chemicals their household products contain. She said: 'The paradox is that most of our exposure to air pollutants occurs indoors and a primary source is consumer products. \u2018But the public lacks full and accurate information on the ingredients in these products. \u2018Our indoor air environments are essentially unregulated and unmonitored. \u2018Given the lack of information, consumers may choose products with claims such as green, natural, or organic, but those claims are largely untested.\u2019"}

You have to come back and show the manager you\u2019re willing and able, and are still working hard for a place,\u2019 he insisted. Quinn made his last start in the Premier League on January 18. \u2018No one is guaranteed a starting spot, the squad is stronger than ever with some great additions and the manager will have some headaches.\u2019 Poland may be the group leaders having set the cat amongst the pigeons by beating Germany, but the Dubliner maintains Ireland must be the ones to set the tempo and impose themselves on the visitors. \u2018Every game is a must-win game, you want to win all these games and try to get as good a lead as possible. But it doesn\u2019t work like that with such a tough and strong group,\u2019 said Quinn. \u2018It is a big game, we know how big it is, there\u2019s no point in beating around the bush. But we\u2019ll go out and do our best. \u2018We\u2019ll leave no stone unturned and do all our tactics, and then we\u2019ll go out and do our job. There\u2019s no point in just talking about it and looking at the videos, we\u2019ve got to get on the ball and bring the game to them,\u2019 the 28-year-old continued. \u2018I think everyone is a little bit surprised with Germany, they\u2019ve had a sluggish start and it\u2019s a bit of a hangover from last summer. In European football at the minute, any team can beat anyone but you\u2019ve just got to be the best team on the day and hopefully that will come good for us on Sunday.\u2019 Scotland and Germany are both highly likely to win this weekend against Gibraltar and Georgia respectively, so there is little room for error with Ireland level on seven points with them both. \u2018I think we can see that, it doesn\u2019t take a scientist to work that out,\u2019 Quinn added. \u2018But maybe it\u2019s the team that just limits the mistakes and capitalise on their home form that will progress.\u2019"}

The former captain of Somerset and South Africa left wife Morgan Deane Smith devastated at the news having led her to believe that he wanted to save his marriage, her friend reportedly told South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper. Smith, 34, has been following the South African team at the Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in recent weeks after he retired from the game last year. Scroll down for video. Friends of his Morgan Deane Smith, \u00a0a singer from Ireland, accused the sports star of \u2018abandoning\u2019 his family in favour of touring and partying with his friends. Friends of his 29 year-old wife, a singer from Ireland, accused the sports star of \u2018abandoning\u2019 his family in favour of touring and partying with his friends. The couple, who were married in 2011 following a brief romance, have two young children \u2013 a two year old daughter and a son aged one. Mrs Smith, who was a backing singer for Jedward in the 2011 Eurovision song Contest, has not spoken publicly since news of the couple\u2019s separation was revealed two weeks ago. However \u2018unnamed friends\u2019 of the mother-of-two revealed details of the acrimonious break-up which has shocked Smith\u2019s fans in South Africa. \u2018He is only interested in going out with his friends and partying. He is obsessed with the limelight and would go to the opening of an envelope. He finds her boring and thinks she is a nag when she asks him to spend time with his family,\u2019 a friend told the newspaper. The report revealed that the singer, whose band Industry twice topped the charts in Ireland, was under the impression that her husband was keen to make their marriage work and had agreed to attend couple counseling sessions. Instead, she learned that he wanted a divorce in a text message he\u2019d sent to her in error, only minutes after reassuring her that their relationship could be saved. Former South Africa and Somerset captain Graeme Smith has split from his wife Morgan, pictured with their children. A source loyal to Mrs Smith told the Sunday Times, \u2018She does everything for her children not to see her cry, but she just can't believe how he has treated her. He has watched her go through this alone. \u2018The man has completely isolated her. Her whole life was his life, his friends were her friends, and she has just been left on her own with the kids. She has become reclusive in their home - only going to the gym and to take the kids out.\u2019 Smith reportedly became cold towards his wife some weeks ago after she\u2019d flown home to Ireland to visit her family. After arriving back in Cape Town, she was given the number of a lawyer to consult by an intermediary acting for Smith. When she confronted her husband, he denied he wanted a divorce or had sought legal advice, her friends told the paper. Last year, Smith bowed out of top-flight cricket, saying he wanted to \u2018see my children grow\u2019, prompted by a terrible accident in which his daughter suffered burns from boiling water. Minutes after this reassurance, Mrs Smith received a text from her husband \u2013 apparently intended for his lawyer \u2013 demanding to know \u2018why Morgan had been informed, because he [Smith] wanted to tell her himself.\u2019 The haste with which Smith has insisted on a divorce has led his distraught wife to wonder whether he has met someone else. \u2018She has been thinking about this, because the divorce came so quickly. She doesn't know for sure if there is another woman, but if there is, she will have a lot to say to her,\u2019 the friend said. The couple met when the Irish pop singer was on holiday in South Africa exactly four years ago. When Smith proposed just three months later, in Ireland, the singer abandoned her career and family and moved to Cape Town to be with him. Within a year they were parents - daughter Cadence was born in 2012 followed a year later by son Carter. But the strain of being alone in a strange city with two small children, while her husband toured with the South African team or made public appearances, began to take its toll on the young mother. She gained a lot of weight and rarely went out. \u2018She is the one who has been raising those children for the past two years. He has had a million jobs. She is a stay-at-home mother. From Monday to Friday she doesn't even leave the house. She doesn't go anywhere, she doesn't have a fancy lifestyle, she doesn't go to social events,\u2019 the friend told the Sunday Times.

{"abstract": "Jenson Button understands why Fernando Alonso will not be making his second debut with McLaren this weekend due to medical advice. Button himself suffered a concussion in 2003 and knows the precautions taken with Alonso are necessary. Despite the lack of running during testing, Button is confident in the car and believes there is potential for something special with McLaren Honda, but acknowledges it will take time.", "article": "Jenson Button can understand the reasoning why Fernando Alonso will not be making his second debut with McLaren this weekend. On the advice of doctors, Alonso is absent from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix after sustaining concussion following a heavy crash on the final day of the second pre-season test last month. Fears were expressed to Alonso of'second-impact syndrome' whereby a serious brain injury, or even death, could occur should the 33-year-old be involved in a second incident so soon after the first. Jenson Button walks through the paddock\u00a0at the Albert Park circuit ahead of the Australian Grand Prix. After several weeks testing (above), the Formula One season gets underway in Melbourne on Sunday. Despite that there has been scepticism of the decision, particularly as Alonso spent three days in a local hospital and passed a variety of tests. Button knows what it is like to suffer concussion as he was involved in a severe accident in practice for the 2003 Monaco Grand Prix, yet just a fortnight later was back behind the wheel of his car in Canada. On reflection, Button knows he should arguably have never driven in that subsequent race, so can understand the precautions taken with Alonso, even if they appear extreme. 'As far as I know he (Alonso) had three days (in hospital) undergoing every scan and check under the sun,' said Button. 'I'm sure whatever they've chosen to do is the correct decision. The British F1 driver understands why McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso will miss the race. Alonso suffered concussion after a high speed crash at the Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. 'Concussions vary. Some are very light, and then you have different grades of concussion, brain damage. 'For me, I raced two weeks after an accident in Monaco in 2003, with checks of standing on a box, closing one eye and whatever else I had to do. 'To be honest, I scraped through, so they let me race, but that was nearly 13 years ago. Now the checks are very stringent. 'With the incidents we've had, in particular with Jules (Bianchi in Japan last year), the medical people are going to be more strict, and so they should be.' A helicopter takes Alonso to hospital after the former world champion crashed during pre-season testing. The Spaniard waves to supporters after leaving hospital, having passed numerous tests. Despite Alonso's incident at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya, Button insists he has no issues with the car. Initially, speculation centred on mechanical failure or an electrical issue given the new McLaren is now powered by Honda. The Woking-based marque, however, categorically ruled out any such faults and instead stated a freak gust of wind played its part in the double world champion veering off track and into a wall. Heading into Sunday's race at Melbourne's Albert Park, despite the lack of running throughout testing given numerous other glitches, Button maintains the car is one of the best he has driven. Button was involved in a serious accident at the 2003 Monaco Grand Prix before returning two weeks later. 'Competitiveness is impossible to say, but in terms of feel and how the car is and what you want it to do, it does everything right and a lot better than last year,' assessed Button. 'This car is very different in that it does what you hope it will do, which is very important for myself, and also for Fernando as far as I can see. 'The basic philosophy of the car and idea of the aerodynamics and how it works is definitely right. I haven't driven a McLaren like this before, not in the way it works. 'I'm not saying it's the quickest McLaren I have ever driven, because it's not, but in the way it works, the basic car is very good.' McLaren reserve driver\u00a0Kevin Magnussen will race in Alonso's absence at the Australian Grand Prix. Whilst Button is confident of finishing Sunday's race, he appreciates McLaren Honda are a long way off from challenging their main rivals. 'You are going to have doubts, and it would be stupid not to have doubts when you look at winter testing because we haven't completed a simulated race distance yet,' said Button. 'Yes, I do know it's going to be a tough start, but it's also very different. 'The last two years have not been the easiest seasons for us, but I think the difference with this year is the understanding there could be something very special on the horizon with McLaren Honda. Button looks on as the\u00a0NSX concept vehicle at a Honda F1 Grand Prix press conference. 'The whole team is unbelievably excited about what could happen in the future. 'But we also understand there's a lot of work needed before we even start thinking too much about winning races, even podiums and fighting for the world championship. 'It's a great base for the future, but it is going to take time. It's not going to be an overnight thing.'"}

But Bale didn't appear to be showing any signs of rust as he took Israel apart, a team that hadn't lost a competitive game in two and a half years. \"To come out on top is amazing. The first half was very hard. We did a lot of running, closed them down well, and luckily got the goal which gave us a lot of confidence,\" Bale told British broadcaster Sky Sports after the game. \"We came out in the second half buzzing and showed what a good team we are.\" he added. Italy, Czech Republic held. Meanwhile Italy narrowly avoided defeat against Bulgaria. A flurry of first half goals in Sofia had given Bulgaria a 2-1 lead, a lead they looked to have held on to. But late in the game Brazilian-born striker Eder scored on his debut to spare Italy's blushes. The Czech Republic also narrowly avoided defeat, against lowly Latvia.

The unique Mercedes SLS 300 'Porter Special', worth an estimated \u00a34million, which was being driven by F1 and Le Mans legend Jochen Mass crashed into the back of a Lister-Jaguar Knobbly - thought to be worth around \u00a31million. The one-of-a-kind 1955 Mercedes - originally made out of aluminium - had been transported to the Sussex racetrack from German collector Dr Klaus Lahr especially for the Salvadori Cup race. Scroll down for video. This is the moment a \u00a34million Mercedes from the 1950s crashed into the back of a \u00a31million Lister-Jaguar at Goodwood racetrack on Saturday. Spectators watched in shock as the Mercedes - driven by racing legend Jochen Mass - ploughed into the Jaguar as it exited a chicane. The rear of the Jaguar - which was slowing to enter the pit lane - was wrenched upwards, while the front of the classic Mercedes disintergrated. Driver Mass crashed into the back of the 1959 Jaguar driven by Tony Wood during the qualifying round for the race and the famous racing car had to be winched onto a tow-truck. The Lister, owned by Barry Wood, was entering the pits when Mass powered out of a chicane to find the slowing Lister in front of him. He slammed on the brakes but his wheels locked up, causing the Mercedes to smash into the rear of the Lister. It brought the qualifying period to an abrupt halt with stewards running onto the track to help both drivers and deal with fuel which had leaked onto the Tarmac. Both drivers emerged from their cars unscathed but were taken to the medical room as a precaution. The cars did not fare so well however, with both suffering serious damage. The Mercedes came off the worst, with the front-end badly dented, meaning it could not be moved on its own. The back of the Jaguar was bent out of shape by the force of the impact. It is now known whether the vehicles were insured, but it is feared repairs could cost more than \u00a3100,000. At the time, Wood was the second fastest in the Lister while Mass was 22nd. The Mercedes is unique, having been created by a US mechanic in the 1950s, and it is feared it will be difficult to restore to its former glory. The Jaguar fared equally badly in the accident and was left with the rear badly twisted into the air and damage to both sets of wheels. Stewards rushed to deal with fuel which spilled onto the track and the race was stopped. Luckily, the drivers of both cars were unharmed. A statement from Goodwood Motorsport said: 'There was a collision during qualifying for the Salvadori Cup on the afternoon of Saturday, March 21, 2015, involving car 23, a Lister-Jaguar 'Knobbly' driven by Tony Wood and car 8, a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLS \"Porter Special\" driven by Jochen Mass. 'Following the contact between the two cars, both of which stopped close to the pit lane entrance, the session was immediately red-flagged and did not resume. 'In line with our safety protocols, both drivers were taken to the circuit medical centre for precautionary checks and were released shortly afterwards to enjoy the remainder of the weekend. 'Unfortunately, neither car was able to be repaired in time to take part in Sunday's race and neither driver was able to take any further part in the on-track action.' The SLS started out life as a Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing but was modified in the US in 1956 after a being involved in another serious crash. It was once well known in US racing circles as the 'Mercedes-Corvette'. Th accident happened at the 73rd Goodwood Members Meeting, in which  cars from all generations are taken around the track for fans. Stewards were unable to move the classic Mercedes and it had to be lifted on to a tow truck before being removed from the famous circuit. Side-view pictures show the damage to the front of the car, which will be returned to its owner in Germany in a much worse state than it left."}

The backdrop, a white panel adorned with a red rose and the word'mamma' in script, completed the theme of the show, which was fittingly called 'Viva la Mamma' According to spectators, the youngsters on the runway were comfortable and extremely well-behaved - but some of the pictures from the show tell something of a different story. A model is seen holding her precious cargo as she showcases looks from Dolce & Gabbana's\u00a0autumn/winter 2015 collection. Another shot sees a model carrying her baby so that she faces forward, toward the audience, a position that does not seem to sit well with the blue-eyed little girl. Even the designs were in keeping with the theme, with evening gowns embroidered with children's doodles and other designs emblazoned with the words 'Je t'aime maman' and 'Mamma'. Mothering day isn't officially celebrated in Italy until May, a full two months after the UK's version of the holiday, but it clearly played an important part in the tone of the show. A model and her  mini-me strut their stuff in matching pink dresses adorned with the words 'je t'aime maman' Karlie Kloss is seen in the forefront as a model walks behind her carrying a tiny fashionista. Even the designs were in keeping with the theme, with evening gowns embroidered with children's doodles. Also on the runway was supermodel Karlie Kloss, who cut an elegant figure in a black velvet dress featuring a beautiful red rose print cut just below the knee and worn with red satin shoes. The 22-year-old's hair was coiffed in a simple up-do, with a slick of burgundy lipstick setting off the look. Karlie recently announced her decision to hang up her Victoria's Secret Angel wings in order to attend\u00a0NYU's Gallatin School of Individualised Studies.

Cook believes that hindsight has proven the ECB wrong and that he would have been able to lead England out of their group if he had been there. He also believes that the ECB have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament.", "article": "Alastair Cook has slammed the ECB for the timing of his dismissal as one-day captain, claiming the World Cup shambles which followed has shattered the players' confidence. Cook's forthright views increase the pressure on head coach Peter Moores and managing director Paul Downton on the day the Test squad to tour West Indies was announced. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, where he is preparing to play for the MCC, Cook said defeats by Australia and New Zealand proved that the decision to axe him was, with hindsight, incorrect. Alastair Cook was removed as England one-day captain in December, before the cricket World Cup. England's cricketers were eliminated from the World Cup at the group stage by Bangladesh. Cook believes hindsight has proved the ECB wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament. Cook told The Daily Telegraph: 'I can't speak about what's gone on there in depth, but you always back yourself, and I would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken away from me. 'The selectors made that decision because they thought it was the best for English cricket. Hindsight has probably proved them wrong, but now it's very easy to say that.' He added: 'I wouldn't say all of it [confidence] has been [shattered], but a hell of a lot of it has been. You have to remember that it is a different format and you get a change, but all teams are grouped under the same English cricket umbrella, and we can't be naive enough to think that it's not. 'We have a repairing job to do, and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and start winning. 'We built that momentum a little bit after the Ashes 14 or 15 months ago with a slightly younger side, including the likes of Gary Ballance and Joe Root. There was a feel-good factor about the English game in the middle of August after the Test matches. Since then, it's been tough going. We've got to rebuild again.' Cook (right) feels England have to rebuild the feel good factor that followed Test success against India. Cook (left) will lead England in three tests in the West Indies in April, before New Zealand visit in May. Cook feels the ECB have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament. Cook would have loved the opportunity to complete a challenge he was set when named Andrew Strauss' successor as ODI captain after the previous World Cup in 2011. 'I was there for three-and-a-half years trying to do a job,' he said. 'We got to No 1 in the world with a full-strength side and got to the final of the Champions Trophy. There were things I can be very proud of. 'As any captain will tell you, leading your country in a World Cup is a huge honour and one that can never be taken lightly. I was very much looking forward to that. 'I understand the pressure I was under. I wasn't scoring the runs I should, or could have been scoring so I understand that my position was in jeopardy. 'But I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to the tournament. Cook (left) was struggling for runs in one-day cricket when the ECB decided to remove him as captain. Cook believes that England would have made it out of their group at the World Cup if he had been there. 'I don't know what's gone on on that tour... but it did look like the lads were shell-shocked from the first two games. 'Whether I would have made a difference, I don't know. 'But I was fully confident we would get out of our group.' VIDEO Morgan has 'no regrets' over failed England campaign."}
{"abstract": "Roar, an action-adventure film released in 1981, is making a return to the big screen after 35 years. The film was made to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment of big cats in captivity, and was made by Noel Marshall and Tippi Hedren, who lived with a pack of lions for six years. During production, 70 members of the cast and crew were injured, but no lions were harmed.", "article": "A film billed as the most dangerous ever made is making a return to the big screen nearly 35 years after its original release. Noel Marshall\u2019s action-adventure film Roar was originally released in 1981 and its 11-year production is infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew. The film revolves around a wildlife preservationist who lives with his wife and children alongside a number of wild lions, tigers, cheetahs and elephants. The film became infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew during production. Its re-release is due to be shown at a handful of cinemas in the US in April, and will be made available to the wider public on a number of platforms as well. The film features Marshall himself, who plays the starring character of Hank, while his real-life partner Tippi Hedren plays the part of his onscreen wife. Hedren\u2019s daughter, Melanie Griffith, is also featured in the film alongside Marshall\u2019s three sons and a number of animal trainers. Marshall is featured riding on a motorbike at the start of the trailer as one of the lions strikes out at him. The idea of the film arrived when Marshall and Hedren discovered a plantation house overrun by lions. While the plot line for the film itself \u2013 two lions putting a family at serious risk by battling for domination \u2013 is action-packed, it is in fact the back story that is the most chilling aspect of the tale. The idea for the film came about when Marshall and Hedren discovered an abandoned plantation house overrun by a large pride of lions while touring wildlife preserves in Africa. Hoping to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by big cats in captivity, they approached a number of animal trainers for help make the concept for the film a reality. Marshall and Hedren wanted to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by cats in captivity. The couple then began adopting and breeding lions in their home in Los Angeles and for six years the family of six lived alongside the pack. They eventually moved to a range north of Los Angeles and began filming. The trailer for the film documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production. Noel Marshall was wounded so many times during the course of the film he was hospitalised with gangrene. Tippi Hedren\u2019s daughter, Melanie Griffith, needed facial reconstruction surgery because of her injuries. Marshall is featured on a motorbike at the start of a film trailer, riding through a pack of lions as one of them strikes out at him as he passes by. Later he is tackled to the ground by another lion as a humorous review from HitFix appears on the screen: \u2018It\u2019s like Walt Disney went insane and shot a snuff version of Swiss Family Robinson\u2019. Genuine fear can be seen etched onto the faces of the various crew members as they are confronted on numerous occasions by the pack. The film's trailer documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production. Seventy members of cast and crew were injured during the course of the film, but the lions were unharmed. The video concludes with the credits and the various injuries sustained by the cast members. Hedren suffered a broken leg, Griffith needed facial reconstruction surgery and Noel Marshall was gored so many times he was eventually hospitalised with gangrene. The film\u2019s cinematographer, Jan de Bont \u2013 who later went on to direct Die Hard \u2013 required 220 stitches after he was scalped by a lion. The film will be re-released 34 years after it debuted in 1981 and will be shown at a handful of US cinemas. No lions were harmed during the making of the film, however. Drafthouse Films partnered with Olive Films to re-release the film, which will be available on numerous platforms later in the summer."}

Passengers could face a hefty fine or prison time for importing dangerous goods without permission. Customs and Border Protection Service have reported an increase in the number of undeclared handguns detected by customs, suggesting that illicit firearm trafficking networks are using the mail to conceal and deliver handguns.", "article": "Airport officials have revealed that throwing knives, samurai swords and even a grenade launcher were among the 300 illegal weapons seized at Perth Airport, in only the last two months. The deadly haul, brought into the country by passengers arriving in Australia, included flick knives, knuckle dusters and a crossbow. The grenade launcher, believed to be from Russia, was one of the more alarming finds. Heavily armed: Knuckle dusters,\u00a0nunchuks and a grenade launcher were among the weapons seized from January 1 to March 4. Figures released by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service state that over 30 real and imitation firearms were seized from airline passengers. Passengers could face a $425,000 fine or 10 years in prison for importing dangerous goods without permission. Authorities say that people must be starting to understand these kinds of weapons won't be let into the country after they saw a drastic decrease in the number of weapons seized from 2013 to 2014. Last year 1,318 illegal weapons were discovered, a significant drop from the 3,075 seized in 2013. Assistant Minister for Imm\u00adigration and Border Protection, Michaelia Cash, told Perth Now that it's overseas vendors that are to blame for selling the weapons to Australians under the guise they will make it across the border. Authorities say Australians are being deceived by international vendors who lead them to believe the weapons will make it home. 'People may think that items such as laser pointers, flick knives, and shock devices make for an impressive souvenir but they could end up costing you more than you bargained for,' Senator Cash said. She recommends that travellers make sure they understand the restrictions placed on what comes through customs so they don't end up throwing their hard earned cash away. 'Every year, travellers are losing their hard-earned money by bringing items and gifts back into Australia that they can't keep. 'If you bring these things back they'll be seized. You'll lose the item, waste your money and may face a \u00adpenalty.' Airports aren't the only target with reports claiming firearms are being trafficked through the mail. In an annual report, by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, it was found that the number of undeclared handguns detected by customs had skyrocketed by 60 per cent. The report advised people are using the mail to conceal and deliver handguns in illicit firearm trafficking networks. Authorities maintain that identifying and dismantling these networks is a 'high priority'. 'We have strengthened our targeting regimen and enhanced opportunities to increase detection of illicit firearms,' the report said."}

It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. It also emerged that he was questioned by police last October on suspicion of going to Syria to fight jihadists. He was preparing to fly from the US to Turkey after contacting a Kurdish group on Facebook.

Official investigators believe the picture, first published by The Mail on Sunday last year, holds the key to the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which was blown apart in mid-air, killing all 298 on board. Afterwards, Ukraine and Russia blamed each other, and still do, and the incident fuelled an increasingly bloody civil war which has seen large parts of Eastern Ukraine taken over by military forces loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dutch and Australian investigators now believe the image represents evidence that the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a Russian-made BUK rocket. They travelled to Ukraine to interview the photographer who took the picture from the roof of his block of flats in Torez, some 12 miles from the site where the missile was launched, and took away the camera as evidence. They believe the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the BUK missile attack from a position on the edge of the town of Snizhne in pro-Russian rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Amid fears for his safety he was relocated to a safe house and has been under the protection of Ukraine\u2019s secret service ever since.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018I was in my flat in a suburb of Torez, and heard a loud noise \u2013 far louder than artillery or grenades. \u2018I ran to the window and saw how the wind was spreading the smoke trail above the horizon. Defenceless: All 298 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which was blown apart in mid-air on July 17, last year, were killed. \u2018My camera was near the window. I grabbed it and ran upstairs to the roof to take a picture. I took my first picture but saw I had electric cables right in the middle, so then maximized the zoom and took the second. 'Then I turned round and on the other side, to the north, saw a trail of dark blue smoke. I decided that the missile must have hit a petrol station. I climbed to another other part of the roof to take a picture from there. 'It took me three minutes, and I took the third picture. I had no idea that my third picture was the smoke from the just crashed plane. \u2018I did not see any plane. So I did not take any more pictures. If only I had known more about what happened then of course I would have taken more. But it was only two hours later when I found out.\u2019 He immediately sent the pictures to a friend, who posted them on Twitter. This fact is seen as decisive because it allowed no time for manipulation of the image. At the time, fake pictures were appearing on the web. Among the dead:\u00a0Evie, Mo, and Otis Maslin were on board flight MH17 with their grandfather Nick when it was shot down. Leaks from the Dutch probe indicate that investigators believe it likely the BUK was fired not by rebels but by Russian soldiers. These troops \u2018might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything\u2019, according to Robert Bas, a journalist with Dutch state broadcaster NOS, citing anonymous sources in the investigation. Last week a reporter with RTL, another broadcaster in the Netherlands, said shrapnel he collected from the crash site was tested by forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane\u2019s in London, who said it matched the explosive charge of a BUK. A fragment from the warhead showed a Cyrillic letter, apparently part of a serial number. The combined weight of evidence undermines claims from Russia that the plane was downed by a Ukrainian warplane. In the past there have been claims from Moscow that MH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-25. Lethal: A BUK missile system on display during a Russian air show.

The price of hitting yourself on the thumb or hanging wallpaper upside down has just got cheaper. For Poundland is launching a range of 200 DIY essentials from hammers to packs of paint brushes and screwdrivers - and yes, they all cost no more than \u00a31. The thriving budget chain has signed a partnership with celebrity builder Tommy Walsh, who appeared alongside Alan Titchmarsh in the BBC\u2019s Changing Rooms, to develop and test the range. Recent reports from major DIY warehouses suggest many young adults don\u2019t have the skills or the interest in home make-overs or doing jobs around the home. However, Mr Walsh insists people can save a fortune by avoiding the need for tradesmen if they have their own tools and make sure they plan their jobs carefully. He claims the items in the range are at least five to six times more expensive at the major DIY chains. He gave the example of a three piece professional paint brush set, which would be at \u00a35-\u00a36 at a leading shop. Other items include a 7.5m tape measure and 20g tube of superglue, as well as a 1m spirit level, paint rollers and trays, masking tape, a five pack of screwdrivers and the 330g tubes of all-purpose filler and mastic. \u2018The cost of calling out a tradesman or even buying tools for small home improvements can mount up quickly,\u2019 Mr Walsh said. \u2018DIY should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Customers can fill their toolbox with all the essentials they need for as little as \u00a310.\u2019 The range has been trialled by tradesmen who decorate and carry out repairs for a living to ensure it is robust and easy to use. The grips have been ergonomically designed so the hand tools are easy to use for long periods without causing blisters. The decision by Poundland to move into DIY comes just as some of the big names are closing outlets, following a fall in trade. Homebase is shutting 80 stores amid claims today\u2019s home makers do not know how to do even simple jobs like putting up a shelf or a curtain pole. Budget: The chain hopes to step in to the gap left by floundering. Poundland has helped DIY novices by splitting the range into four colour coded categories - \u2018Decorating Essentials\u2019 in red, \u2018Adhesives\u2019 in blue, \u2018Toolbox Essentials\u2019 in yellow and \u2018Fixtures and Fittings\u2019 in orange. Each pack will provide tips from Mr Walsh on how to carry out the corresponding DIY task. The partnership with the celebrity builder is part of a wider trend by the budget chain to bring in middle income shoppers. It already offers Jane Asher bakeware range, which has achieved double its predicted sales, while there are beauty products that have been well received by the fashion press, and jewellery. Poundland chief executive Jim McCarthy said: \u2018Purchasing DIY products can be very expensive. We believe we have identified a gap in the market and can challenge other retailers with our more affordable products. \u2018Tommy\u2019s range offers outstanding value for money and will make home improvement accessible for everyone no matter what their budget.\u2019"}

Installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago, \u00a31million-per-year O\u2019Neill and his assistant Keane \u2013 with a \u00a3600,000 salary - were given a remit of qualification for Euro 2016, a task made easier by the expansion to a 24-team format. Defeat against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday, however, would all but render redundant any hope of automatic progression to next summer\u2019s finals in France. It would be they and Scotland left to do battle for the play-off berth. Aiden McGeady jokes with Ireland assistant Roy Keane during a training session earlier this week. Sunderland defender John O'Shea catches a bib as the side prepare for the crucial qualifier against Poland. The mood here in Dublin is not one of optimism. An inquest, you feel, awaits O\u2019Neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders. One newspaper described their manager as \u2018bookish and vaguely befuddled\u2019, while the \u2018carnage\u2019 which follows Keane was also noted. Certainly, there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around Keane this week and the No 2 gave an untypically subdued and low-key performance in front of the press. O\u2019Neill, meanwhile, has kept all talk to football. He has ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since his arrival. He has, though, recognised the magnitude of the outcome against the Poles. \u2018The importance of the occasion should not be missed,\u2019 he said. \u2018Defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification. It might not decide everything, but it is very significant. We have to try to win. Martin O'Neill addresses his squad at the training session as they bid to go level with Poland in Group D.

We have to make them count.\u2019 O\u2019Neill, whose fourth-placed side trail Poland by three points, added: \u2018We can change all of that (negative talk) with one result and one fantastic performance. \u2018We will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and I\u2019m not overly concerned with what people say before the game. \u2018We have given ourselves a chance (of qualification) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match.\u2019 One criticism of O\u2019Neill is that he does not know his preferred XI or, indeed, formation. That much was obvious by him talking this week of players winning a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in Malahide. O'Neill is hoping to banish all the negativity around the squad with a result against Poland. One player not guaranteed to start is captain Robbie Keane. He was dropped for the morale-shattering 1-0 defeat in Scotland in November. The LA Galaxy striker, 34, was sat next to O\u2019Neill at Saturday's pre-match press conference and was diplomatic when pressed on his possible exclusion. \u2018That\u2019s up to the manager (if I play),\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ll be ready whether that\u2019s from the bench or starting. I\u2019m the captain, I have to set an example. \u2018But I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think I could make a difference. I still want to be the best. I have that hunger.\u2019 Keane, sensing the air of negativity in his homeland, added: \u2018It\u2019s up to us to make this a turning point for the team. Victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost.\u2019 Lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for O\u2019Neill before they face Scotland back in Dublin.

In the recording, Emwazi tells how he was questioned by British security services after he was flown home from Tanzania  suspected of trying to join  Somali terror group al-Shabaab. The ISIS killer complained that he was being 'threatened' by MI5 and moaned that agents were 'putting words in his mouth'. Three years after his claims he wasn't an extremist, Emwazi appeared in Syria beheading Western hostages in ISIS videos.

In a recording released today, he told Cage: '[The MI5 agent] said: \"Mohammed, what do you think of 7/7?\" I said: \"Innocent people  have died.\"' He added: 'He started telling me: \"What do you think of 9/11?\" I told him: \"This is a wrong thing. What happened was wrong. What do you want me to say?\". 'If I had the opportunity for those lives to come back then I would make those lives come back. I don\u2019t think... I think what happened is wrong.' But the MI5 agent did not believe his views were moderate and replied: 'I still believe you are going to Somalia to train.' Emwazi moaned: 'He said: 'We are going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed. We already have been and we are going to keep a close eye on you' - threatening me.' Cage have released the tape as part of their widely-criticised claims that Emwazi was 'harassed' by security services. They were slammed after releasing a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain' last week and tried to blame authorities for his actions. Cage's statement claimed that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him'. The reported interview with MI5 took place after Emwazi was refused entry to Tanzania because authorities suspected he was trying to get to Somalia, where terrorist organisation al-Shabaab have been known to train British militants. In the recordings, Emwazi (pictured in the ISIS beheading videos which earned him the nickname 'Jihadi John')  claims he condemned previous attacks such as 9/11 and 7/7 when he was questioned by an agent. The recordings were released by human rights group Cage, who have been widely criticised for trying to blame British authorities for Emwazi's actions. Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebolajo was picked up by the SAS and MI5 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east African country in November 2010. Extremist Samantha Lewthwaite - known as the 'White Widow' after her bomber husband Germaine Lindsay took part in the 7/7 London attacks - is also believed to be part of the al-Shabaab. The year after his recorded conversation with Cage, Emwazi contacted Mail on Sunday Security Editor Robert Verkaik in December 2010. He told Mr Verkaik he feared MI5 were following him and wrote in an email: 'Sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking, not fearing they may kill me.' Mr Verkaik recalled: 'Like many young Muslim men at the time who I had interviewed, he appeared to have a grievance against the police and MI5. But this man was different \u2013 in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in Syria.' After foiled attempts to go to his father's home country, Kuwait, and to get a teaching job in Saudi Arabia, Emwazi slipped out of Britain and later appeared in Syria. He has since gained global notoriety as the masked killer of Western hostages including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines in ISIS beheading videos which have shocked the world. Emwazi was interviewed after he was picked up by authorities in Tanzania in 2009, suspected of trying to get into Somalia to join Islamist group al-Shabaab (pictured) Other British extremists have also been linked to al-Shabaab - including Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo and 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite.

Starting his career during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, his most famous works depicting Chinese soldiers were transformed into propaganda posters which were distributed en masse all over the country. Four decades on and a far cry from charging tourists $30 for a portrait in Sydney's Darling Harbour, Shen found himself painting one of the world's most influential men when he was commissioned to produce the first official portrait of Pope Francis. Scroll down for video. Highly regarded Chinese-Australian artist Jiawei sits next to his portrait of Cardinal Pell. More recently, the 66-year-old artist found himself on a Vatican balcony, using his gift to create a lifelike portrait of the Catholic Church's money man, Cardinal Pell. Commissioned by a Catholic university, the classic portrait features the Australian prelate looking over St Peter's Square. After his history as a Chinese propaganda artist, Shen maintains he doesn't see his artwork for the Catholic Church in the same light. Shen's journey from favoured propaganda artist of the People's Liberation Army to papal portraitist is an unusual tale of talent and timing. 'For me, one door closed but another always opened,' Mr Jiawei said of his career in a recent phone interview from his studio in Bundeena, south of Sydney. Shen was about to complete high school when Mai Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, a decade long campaign to restore ideological purity to China's anti-capitalist revolution. Universities were shut down, along with Shen's aspirations of attending art school. Fully embracing the communist spirit of the times he joined the Red Guards and then the People's Liberation Army. Caught in the maelstrom of the revolution his artistic talents were recognised and he because one of the many propaganda artists who glorified workers, farmers and soliders in the Socialist Realisim style seen in Soviet propaganda. In a bid to depict soldiers as strong and heroic Shen's most famous work, 'Standing Guard for Our Great Motherland', was altered to fit regime standardsfor revolutionary art. Mr Jiawei then shot to fame in the 1970's and 1980's becoming one best known artists in China. Shen takes pride in knowing his art rose to fame in a very challenging time where oil paintings were not easily obtained. He says he didn't sell out to the idealised standards of propaganda art that most other Chinese artists copied. Instead, he says he relied on nature to guide his brush. Shen takes pride in knowing his art rose to fame in a very challenging time where oil paintings were not easily obtained. 'This is why today if you look back at that time, in China, most artwork is different than mine,' he said. 'I'm proud of that.' Shen maintains his propaganda days are over saying his new works of Pope Francis and Cardinal Pell are a part of normal art history. 'I stopped my propaganda work in the 1970s,' he said, adding, 'even church commission work, this is part of normal artwork, part of commission and part of history.' Byron Hurst, Chairman of Hazelhurst Gallery, told Daily Mail Australia that Shen first caught the attention of Australian church officials with a 1994 portrait of Mary MacKillop, the 19th-century nun who ministered to the poor and in 2010 became Australia's first saint. Mr Hurst said completing the painting meant a lot to the 'highly regarded international portrait artist' who had been given refugee status in Australia after The Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. 'For Jiawei, it was a way to say thank you to Australia for giving him a home' 'For Jiawei, it was a way to say thank you to Australia for giving him a home and of course it was an opportunity to pick up three other important commission with Greg Craven, Sir Peter Cosgrove and Cardinal Pell,' Mr Hurst told Daily Mail Australia. Basing the portrait on photographs, Shen painted Francis with outstretched arms, a white dove about to land on his shoulder. He is surrounded by people Shen painted from the photos of crowds at papal audiences, slipping in an image of his daughter for fun. There are several birds in the painting, homage to Francis' namesake, the nature-loving St. Francis of Assisi. 'When the pope approved this project and they sent me the photos, (they said) the pope wants a painting with people together,' Shen said. Shen is very highly regarded in the art community and has completed works of other high profile Australian such as John Howard and Princess Mary. The painting now hangs in a villa in the Vatican gardens that houses the Pontifical Academy for Sciences, which deals with Francis' pet projects on human trafficking, slavery and youth culture, among other issues. Geoff Raby, Australia's former ambassador to China who has a print of Shen's 'Standing Guard' in his collection of propaganda art, said Shen's portrait career is a natural progression from the propaganda art and historical paintings that he is most famous for.

He grew up playing the role in rugby union and is confident he can adjust to the position. He is looking forward to the challenge of playing against Catalans Dragons, who have a strong squad and are formidable at home.", "article": "Rangi Chase says he would be happy to switch to full-back for Salford, revealing he grew up playing the role in rugby union. The former Castleford and England stand-off won the Man of Steel award in 2011 for his brilliant displays with the number six on his back but an injury crisis has left the Red Devils without three specialist full-backs for Saturday's game against Catalans Dragons in Perpignan. Coach Iesytn Harris has called up youngster Jon Ford in the absence of Kevin Locke, Niall Evalds and Ben Jones-Bishop but admits he is considering moving Chase into the full-back spot. Rangi Chase, pictured in action for England in 2013, could  be set to play at full-back for Salford. 'I'll play wherever,' Chase said. 'I grew up playing full-back in rugby union, so I'm not unfamiliar with it. 'Obviously I've not played there for a while but, if I do get put there, I will have to adjust. 'Obviously when we're attacking it doesn't bother me but defensively you've got to make sure you're in the right spots. I've got to make sure my communication is right if I'm back there.' Chase stepped into the full-back role towards the end of last Saturday's game against Hull after Evalds went off with a pulled hamstring and Harris believes he could perform the role from the start against the Dragons. 'Rangi is a versatile player,' Harris said. 'He can play a little bit of nine if he has to, he can play in the halves, he can play at full-back. He's a natural footballer and he generally creates opportunities wherever he plays on the field. 'And he's very much a team player, he wants to do what's best for the team. The most important thing is Rangi being on the field. It's trying to get the balance right within the team.' Wherever he plays on Saturday, Chase's duel with the Catalans' Australian playmaker Todd Carney promises is a mouthwatering prospect, although the player himself is playing it down. 'I'm not bothered if it's Todd Carney or if it's someone else,' Chase said. 'I'm not worried about him and I'm sure he's not worried about me. At the end of the day, I'll just focus on my own game.' Chase was in masterful form as he steered Salford to their first win of the season against Hull but he admits they will be to take a step up against a Dragons team who are near invincible at the Stade Gilbert Brutus. 'It was a good win in the end,' Chase said. 'We had to dig deep for each other and hopefully we can take some confidence from that. We need to build again. 'It is tough going there. They'are an aggressive side and, when they're at home, they grow even more with their support. 'I think the squad they have is the best they've had since I've been here so I'm looking forward to that.'"}

Falcao was left as an unused substitute as United pressed for an equaliser in their FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, but Van Gaal was quick to defend his forward. The Dutch manager interrupted a journalist asking about the striker to defend his forward's record, and hit out at the press for enjoying the Colombian's dismal record, before ending with a sarcastic remark. Louis van Gaal (left) trudges away after the defeat, with Radamel Falcao (right) walking ahead of him. Van Gaal was in a bad mood at the press conference, pointing accusingly at a journalist for the question. As he left the room the Dutchman sarcastically remarked'very good question', and gave a thumbs up. The United boss decided not to use Falcao despite chasing an equaliser, keeping the expensive star benched. 'He scored four goals and has 3 or 4 assists, so that is his contribution,' said a clearly annoyed Van Gaal. 'And he stimulates also the other players, so that's also an aspect of the profession.' 'But it is now easy for you to say that (criticism of Falcao), and that's why you are saying that. And you are very happy to say that, I see that in your face.' When the journalist then pointed out that four goals is not very much for a striker on \u00a3280,000 a week, Van Gaal seemed to agree, but continued to take issue with the line of questioning. The 63-year-old took issue with the line of inquiry about Falcao, interrupting a journalist's question. Falcao has scored four goals since joining on loan, a meagre return for \u00a3280,000 per week. Van Gaal issues tactical instructions during the game, but was unable to stem the tide against Arsenal. 'Yes,' he responded. 'I cannot change that. I cannot change facts, and you know that. But you can continue.'

But the then Prime Minister was about to go into a meeting with Yugoslavia president Slobodan Milosevic in a bid to bring an end to the raging war in Kosovo and could not speak. As a result, Sir Alex admitted defeat and United ended up going to FIFA's inaugural Club World Championship in Brazil in an attempt to boost the FA's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the right to host the 2006 World Cup, and pulling out of a competition they had won a year previously. Sir Alex Ferguson \u00a0(right) asked Tony Blair (left) if Manchester United could compete in the 1999-2000 FA Cup. Manchester United were asked by Blair's envoy to play at the inaugural Club World Championship in 2000.

But in June of 1999 he was an member of the influential Independent Manchester United Supporters Association and in regular contact with the fiery Scotsman. Andy, who made the revelation in an interview with the fanzine Red News, explained the unlikely story to Sportsmail. 'United came out as the villains in all of it,' Andy said. 'But both Sir Alex and then chairman Martin Edwards were under incredible pressure from Tony Banks, the Prime Minister's envoy for the World Cup bid, and from David Davies, the FA's acting chief executive to pull out of the FA Cup and go to Brazil for the Fifa tournament. 'As fans we wanted to find ways of keeping them in the FA Cup and we thought we had come up with a solution. 'It involved moving some of the fixtures to earlier in the season and creating a gap before United were due to go in January during which, if the FA would move the tie, they could play their third round cup match.' Manchester United were under pressure to withdraw from the FA Cup, according to Andy Walsh (centre) Andy explained that the plan had gathered momentum, but added that things took a turn for the worse at the Charity Shield. 'We were playing Arsenal and Martin Edwards was sat next to the new Minister for Sport, Kate Hoey. She made some remark along the lines of \"I believe you're ruining this season's FA Cup\" and when word of that got back to Fergie he was furious. 'I spoke to him over the phone and he said: \"That's it, they're forcing us out. F*** them. We're going to Brazil and that's the end of it\". 'Then he told me that he had tried to call Tony Blair and he couldn't sort it. 'I'd seen Blair on the news that morning going to Yugoslavia so I asked Fergie what had been said. 'He told me that Blair had told him he was about to go into a meeting with Milosevic and that was the end of it.' Blair could not answer Ferguson's request as he was about to speak to  Slobodan Milosevic (pictured) The saga turned into a disaster all around, with England's World Cup bid failing and United drawing with Mexicans Necaxa (with David Beckham sent off and Ferguson sent to the stands for complaining about the decision) and defeated by Brazilians Vasco da Gama. Sir Alex would have the last laugh, however, with his side returning to England to romp to the Premier League title, finishing 18 points ahead of Arsenal.

Louis van Gaal is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of United deciding not to sign Radamel Falcao on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances. Club legend Dwight Yorke formed a formidable partnership with Andy Cole during their years at the Red Devils and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at Old Trafford. Dwight Yorke scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson. Speaking to the\u00a0Sunday Mirror he said: 'I'm sure it's only a matter of time before things click, but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen. For me and (Andrew) Coley, we were blessed, as we had the likes of Beckham, Giggs and Scholes providing the ammunition. It was dead easy for us, we just had to put the ball in the net. They were magical times and we had many magical moments. 'Hopefully the same thing can happen again for this United side.' Andy Cole and Yorke were formidable but had David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs providing them. Wayne Rooney is the clubs current top-scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, with the England captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months. With Robin van Persie recently suffering an injury, Yorke feels that Rooney and Radamel Falcao could be the pairing to set Old Trafford alight again. He said: 'United have world class strikers in the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao, but they don't seem to have found the ideal combination. Wayne Rooney is the clubs top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions despite playing recently in midfield. Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at United and was hauled off against Preston in the FA Cup. 'Rooney and Van Persie as a pairing hasn't really clicked, so maybe a Rooney-Falcao combo might provide the answer for United long-term.' The former Trinidad and Tobago international was also keen to pass on some words of wisdom to Van Gaal and the United players with a place at Wembley just one win away. 'Go out and express yourselves!' Robin van Persie has found it hard to click with Rooney and has struggled since his blistering first season."}

The findings could help identify those most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems.", "article": "Heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life, research found. Heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life, research found. Pessimists who grumble through life were twice as likely to suffer another heart attack, require surgery or even die, compared with more cheerful patients. That is according to a group of scientists at University College London who spent four years studying the mental attitudes of 369 patients admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks. While it is widely known that optimism is linked to better heart health, this is the first study to look at the impact of a patient\u2019s attitude after suffering a heart attack. The team said their findings could be linked to physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic, such as smoking and healthy eating. Smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina, with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking. And this study showed that half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking on year after going into hospital. By contrast, 85 per cent of optimistic smokers kicked the habit entirely. Positive patients are also more likely to aid their recovery by eating more fruit and vegetables after their incident \u2013 some 40 per cent of them ate the recommended five-a-day, compared with just 20 per cent of pessimists. However, the study did find that optimistic patients were no more likely to do more exercise than pessimists. Lead author of the research, Professor Steptoe, said: \u2018Our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board, like quitting smoking and eating more healthily \u2013 this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack. In the UK, 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease, the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina. \u2018Our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health.\u2019 Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, added: \u2018Suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll, which we know can lead to depression, further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack. \u2018If you\u2019re living with a heart condition and struggling to cope, we would urge you to contact your GP who can put you in touch with the necessary support.\u2019 Depression has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients. These findings discovered that pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina. The experts hope their study will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems. In the UK, 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease, the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina. The study was published in Psychosomatic Medicine."}

England play three Tests in the Caribbean next month, where they will hope to shake off the ignominy of their woeful World Cup campaign. The identity of captain Alastair Cook's batting partner is likely to be one of the most vexed questions during selection meetings this week, with incumbent Sam Robson on shaky ground and Trott reportedly being considered for the first time since departing the 2013/14 Ashes with a stress-related condition. Jonathan Trott is reportedly being considered for an England recall ahead of West Indies tour. Yorkshire batsmen Adam Lyth (left) and Alex Lees are ready and willing to provide top order cover. He made his name as a No 3 but with another Yorkshire batsman, Gary Ballance, having made that slot his own, Trott is being considered for a promotion. Even if the 33-year-old travels, England may be tempted to take top-order cover and the title-winning pairing are first in line. Lyth was the top scorer in Division One of the LV= County Championship last summer, making 1489 runs and scoring six centuries, while 21-year-old Lees made 971 runs is rated as one of the country's brightest prospects. 'I feel like I've had a good winter with England Lions and hopefully I get the telephone call which I think I thoroughly deserve,' Lyth told Sportsmail. 'I'm looking forward to what might come for me. You can see how many people in recent years have gone on from playing Lions cricket to representing England and hopefully I can be the next one.

Trott has not been selected by England since departing the 2013/14 Ashes with a stress related condition. 'If that's not the case all I can do is keep scoring runs for Yorkshire.' Lyth and Lees are an unusual study in partners as rivals - as well as batting together throughout the county season they also played for the Lions in South Africa over the winter. Even now they are leading rival Yorkshire teams in an inter-club friendly in Abu Dhabi, but their relationship remains strong. 'Of course I get on really well with Alex and if he gets the nod I'll give him a pat on the back and say well done, but I obviously hope it's me,' added Lyth. Captain Eoin Morgan faces the press after England's disastrous exit from the Cricket World Cup. England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field following defeat by Bangladesh. Lees is aware of the interest he has attracted as a stylish young opener, but is attempting to remain on an even keel as speculation over a Test call builds. 'I know I've had a good 18 months or so but I've got to keep knocking on the door and getting those runs,' he told PA. 'Personally the talk doesn't affect me, positive or negative, because people are always going to have their opinion on you and you just have to focus on your game. 'There is a spot with England and there's a few players in the mix. I think there will be an opportunity for somebody this year. 'It's quite refreshing that both me and Lythy are in the mix, we can really push each other on to be our best. 'That's good for us and hopefully it's good for Yorkshire.'"}

A mother went into the home of a disabled pensioner who had previously looked after her children to empty his wallet while she left her baby outside in the street in its pram. Kelly Tilley snuck into the Stockport home of the 74-year-old after he had left his front door open and stole \u00a3550 in cash from his wallet. She then ran away, pushing her child in the pram. The pensioner, who has mobility problems, had been saving the money to pay household bills and had previously helped Tilley in the past by lending her money and looking after her children. Tilley, of Southport, was jailed for two years as a judge said it was a'mean offence' in which she had intentionally targeted a disabled old man. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Tilley had stolen her way into the man's home at about 2pm on March 31 last year. Andrew Sinker, prosecuting, said: 'He went to the toilet and when he came out the defendant was stood in the hallway. 'He said 'what are you doing?' She asked him for a drink and some money. He refused and told her to get out.' The victim then went into his bedroom and realised his wallet had gone. Mr Sinker said: 'He went out to speak to her but she was running off down the road. Due to mobility problems he was unable to chase after her.' Police searched Tilley's home and found the wallet, with the 31-year-old claiming she had only gone into his home to ask for a loan. Tilley, a drug user, then fabricated a claim that\u00a0he had agreed to lend her cash, but only if she performed a sexual favour for him. Judge Brian Lewis said: 'The victim had been a friend to you, he had lent you money in the past and he had even looked after your children. 'All of which makes it even more mean that you targeted him. 'When you went through that door you knew perfectly well you were not there to borrow money. You were there to steal. Kelly Tilley went into the house in Wavell Avenue in Stockport, leaving her baby in a pram outside. 'You knew he was no match for you physically and as you ran down the road pushing your pram, there was no prospect of him being able to catch you.' Judge Lewis said her unfounded allegation also caused him great distress and the public would be 'outraged' if she was not sent to prison for the offence. Tilley pleaded guilty\u00a0to burglary and admitted breaching bail conditions. She was jailed for two years\u00a0and 10 months and was given a four-year restraining order preventing her from contacting her victim. She had numerous previous convictions including theft."}

He continued: \"During this time I have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. \"And while I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the City of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false.\" Shaw's resignation was announced the same day the City Council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with Shaw. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department. Along with other officials, Shaw was heavily criticized by the Justice Department report, which found that authorities in Ferguson frequently saw residents as \"sources of revenue.\" In fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. In one March 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to Shaw that court collections the previous month reached $235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $200,000. The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their \"great work,\" the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: \"Awesome! Thanks!\" according to the federal report. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd. \"I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,\" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. \"The same justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%.\" CNN's Jennifer Feldman, Holly Yan, Sarah Aarthun and Michael Martinez contributed to this report."}

The advertisement was banned from being used in Italian publications after it ran several times when it was determined that it 'offended the dignity of the woman,' and pulled in the United States after running just once in an issue of Esquire.

Dolce said in the most recent issue of Panoroma magazine;\u00a0'You are born and you have a father and a mother. At least it should be like that.

At a virtually empty Old Trafford the \u00a3280,00-a-week misfit endured a lifeless 72 minutes before suffering the ignominy of hearing cheers when his number was held up. United handed Monaco a \u00a36m loan fee for Falcao, 29, and have an option to buy him for \u00a343.2m at the end of the season. Catch up on all the action with\u00a0Sportsmail's\u00a0Oliver Todd. Host commentator. It could have been a win for Manchester United on Tuesday night, had Falcao not found his way in front of two goalbound shots. The expensive loanee did more harm than good to United's attack. One big positive for the home side though was Rafael. His all-round performance and excellent goal will surely give Louis van Gaal food for thought with regards to the left back slot. Anyway, that's it from our live coverage. Check out Mike Keegan's match report HERE. Thanks for following! That's it, the referee has blown the final whistle and United and Spurs play out a 1-1 draw. Kenny McEvoy scored the opener for Tottenham before Rafael equalised with a brilliant chip in the second half. But despite an attack boasting Radamel Falcao and James Wilson, United couldn't find a winner and Spurs had the best chance of the second half when they hit the bar. Liam Grimshaw heads Pereira's first corner wide via a deflection - a second comes in but it only ends with captain Tom Thorpe fouling the goalkeeper. There will be three minutes of time added on. Andy Kellet's brilliant back-heel sets up Pereira for a cross. His pin-point ball comes to the feet of Harrop but he hesitates in a way that resembled the man he replaced, Falcao. When he finally got the shot off, the effort was blocked and the chance was gone. Still both teams going in search of a winner. Meanwhile, Spurs make a sub. Lesniak is off for Aaron McEneff. Axel Tuanzebe is on as United search for a winner. Off comes Shaquile Coulthirst to be replaced by Daniel Akindiyini. United arguably look better with Falcao off the pitch and James Wilson trusted with a more central role. Rafael's cross from the right just evades the young striker sliding on and shortly after Pereira puts another Rafael delivery over the bar. Falcao is being subbed off! He's been poor in truth and has done more harm than good to United's attacks. Louis van Gaal is unlikely to be impressed and you would think he has no chance of starting at the weekend on this showing.\u00a0He is replaced by Josh Harrop. Oh, and he awkwardly didn't seem to realise it was him that was being hooked at first, just as he did with the first team against Preston North End. It's fair to say the Old Trafford crowd weren't too impressed with him either:. Valdes comes out to scoop up the ball under the feet\u00a0Shaquile Coulthirst but the Spurs make takes exception to his efforts and they have a bit of a shove at each other. Nothing special too and they're both just warned by the referee. Reece James comes off and surprise January signing on loan from Bolton, Andy Kellet, joins the action. Brilliant work from Rafael down the right flank for United and he finds himself in acres of space and with loads of time to pick a pass to the onrushing Goss at the edge of the area. He hits a low shot and it lands at the feet of Falcao but he can only find a slight deflection and it's easily saved. Again, it looked originally goalbound. McEvoy again provides from the left, this time his cross goes all the way to the edge of the area and\u00a0Will Miller, who pokes a shot towards goal but it's easily saved by Valdes. A free-kick routine ends with\u00a0McEvoy playing a short cross to Cameron Carter-Vickers at the near post and his glanced header hits the bar with Valdes nowhere near it. Best chance of the half so far goes to Spurs. Not too much happening here but Rafael is again looking the star of the show for United. Don't think we've seen Falcao touch the ball yet in the second period since he kicked us off. Meanwhile, Christian Fuchs has just put Schalke ahead against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League. It's 1-0 but that leaves Real still 2-1 ahead of aggregate. Keep up to date with our coverage HERE. The Spurs forward makes a darting run forward through midfield with a couple of feints thrown in for good measure, but he's eventually tackled on the edge of the D.

Gerrard, who was facing United for the last time before leaving Liverpool for LA Galaxy, was shown a straight red card by referee Martin Atkinson when he reacted to a challenge from Ander Herrera with a senseless stamp on the Spaniard. United went on to win 2-1 thanks to two goals from Juan Mata as they moved five points clear of their arch-rivals in the race for a Champions League place. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard spoke to Sky Sports after the match to apologise to team-mates and fans. \u2018I\u2019ve let down my teammates and the supporters,\u2019 admitted Gerrard, who now faces a three-match ban. \u2018I take full responsibility. I need to accept it, the decision was right. \u2018I've been in the game long enough when you do something like that. I don\u2019t know what caused it, probably just a reaction to the initial tackle. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t say more about it really, I\u2019ve just come out here to apologise to the dressing-room and supporters.\u2019 Sportsmail expert Jamie Carragher claimed that Gerrard may have been wound up by having to sit on the bench for such a big game before replacing Adam Lallana. Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers refused to castigate the veteran midfielder, and agreed that Liverpool\u2019s insipid first-half performance might have contributed to Gerrard\u2019s red mist. \u2018I won\u2019t criticise him because he\u2019s been brilliant in my time here,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018Sometimes these things happen. \u2018My thinking was always to go with the starting team. I had that clear in my mind and spoke with Steven earlier in the week about that. \u2018Of course he\u2019s a big-game player, a big impact player. He wanted to come in and it was just unfortunate that he got sent off. Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball. \u2018He was probably a little frustrated watching us in the first half, we didn\u2019t make a tackle. \u2018He\u2019s a highly competitive player and he made a great challenge when he first came on \u2013 it was probably our first challenge of the game, with all due respect. He wanted to help the team so much. \u2018At least he was man enough to come out and make that apology. \u2018With Steven it was purely wanting to make the impact. Listen, he\u2019s made his apologies for it. Of course in a big game you suffer when you play with 10 men against 11. \u2018It happened, and great respect to the players that were on there that we kept fighting. Games like that, especially when it goes to 2-0 against 10 men, you can get overrun and end up losing more goals.\u2019 Steven Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 40 seconds of the second-half. Martin Skrtel could also come under scrutiny from the FA if the referee confirms that he did not see an incident at the end in which the Liverpool defender appeared to stamp on United goalkeeper David de Gea. The two players became an embroiled in an ugly confrontation that continued after the final whistle, but Rodgers insisted there was no malice on Skrtel\u2019s part. He added: \u2018The ball has been played through and it looks like it when it is slowed down, he has caught him with intent. I didn\u2019t see it like that. \u2018He is trying to get the ball. You see his foot up, that is a symbol when a player is just trying to get his toe on the ball because if he does that and the keeper brings him down, it is probably a penalty.\u2019 Liverpool\u2019s first defeat in 14 Premier League games since losing 3-0 at Old Trafford in December puts a big dent in their hopes of beating United to a top-four place. Martin Skrtel (centre) was lucky not to be cautioned for this stamp on United keeper David de Gea. \u2018It\u2019s a big challenge,\u2019 admitted Rodgers. \u2018But when I looked at the 10 games that were remaining, it was always going to be difficult to win all 10.

{"abstract": "Wednesday's attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis was carried out by two gunmen and their accomplices, and is believed to be retribution from an ultra-radical Islamist fringe. The attack may have a negative impact on Tunisia's tourism industry and economy, and is a reminder that Tunisia's experiment in democratic reform needs international support. Thousands of Tunisians have gone underground to fight with jihadists in Syria, Libya, and other failing states.", "article": "London (CNN)Tunisia's ultra-radical fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions. Wednesday's attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis was grimly predictable, coming from what the Tunisian Interior Ministry calls a violent ultra-radical Islamist fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services. Jihadist firebrands representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on Tunisia's outward-looking, investment-friendly majority. The attack was carried out by two gunmen, believed to have been supported by at least two accomplices. It may torpedo efforts to revive Tunisia's employment-generating tourism industry and may discourage other big-spending visitors. It will probably lead Tunisians -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected President Beji Caid Essebsi. The attack adds to the global narrative by which Islamic revolutionaries -- increasingly flying under the flag of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) -- pose an existential crisis to moderate states, often Western allies, in the Arab world. Tunisia is the sole country to have emerged from an Arab Spring revolution with its political process intact -- current president, Essebsi, who was elected in November 2014, and his ruling coalition, are the products of a long constitutional process. In four tumultuous years they have competed hard with, but also showed a capacity to work with, opposition parties, led by the \"moderate Islamist\" Ennahda, which is represented in government and parliament. Islamists of a very different hue were responsible for the Bardo attack. Local Salafist groups (of whom the best known is Ansar Al-Sharia) as well as multinational units including ISIS have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young Tunisians in the capital's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior, where the original revolution that removed Ben Ali in February 2011 surged up. Legitimate claims for more jobs and resources in these underprivileged areas during the four subsequent years have largely come to nothing, adding to frustrations. Radical jihadists -- some with back bases in Libya and Algeria -- have posed a major security challenge to successive governments, murdering two prominent \"secular\" politicians in 2013. The Tunisian armed forces, supported by Algeria's more experienced and better equipped military, have been fighting jihadist radicals in the Mount Chaambi region for nearly three years. They have yet to declare final victory, pointing to the resilience of underground groups. While successive governments have acted against radical Salafist groups, thousands of Tunisians have gone underground; they are widely believed to make up the biggest national group fighting with jihadists in Syria (over 3,000 by many accounts), and are present in Libya and other failing states. In January 2013, Tunisians and Libyans made up the majority of jihadists who attacked a strategic gas plant operated by BP and Statoil in southern Algeria. So, the Bardo attackers are a known enemy. Prime Minister Habib Essid has promised a robust security response. But the Tunis tragedy is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the political process. A majority of Tunisians remain foursquare behind preserving \"republican institutions,\" even if they vocally disagree on the detail of policy. It will remind Tunisia's many friends that the country's transition is brittle, and that Tunis needs commitments of support to become reality, with more military and wider financial assistance, and, above all, investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011. Massacre at the Bardo places Tunisia more centrally within the global ISIS narrative, which has recently expanded to neighboring Libya. It is a ghastly way to remind the world that Tunisia's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get."}

PSG twice came from behind at Stamford Bridge, demonstrating great character to play for the last hour of normal time and the added 30 minutes without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after he had been sent off for a foul on Oscar. He later described the Chelsea players as 'babies' for their attempts to influence the referee. In a highly physical match, replete with fouls and contentious decisions, Gary Cahill's second-half strike looked to be sending Chelsea through to the next round, before their former player David Luiz equalised to bring about extra time. Blues forward Eden Hazard then scored a penalty for the home side after Thiago Silva's handball in the box in the first half of extra time, but the PSG captain soon atoned for his error with a goal of his own six minutes from time to secure the Ligue 1 side's progression to the quarter-finals, much to the delight of goading rival fans online. Here are some of the best memes and tweets from social media on the night... PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic had called the Chelsea players 'babies' for their antics on Wednesday night. Chelsea players' heads are replaced with those of babies following their Champions League exit to PSG. Chelsea captain John Terry is parodied as a cry baby, 'Terry Tiny tears' by one Twitter user.

Home Secretary Theresa May wants tougher rules on campuses, while Business Secretary Vince Cable warns it could force debates 'underground'. The clash centres on new guidance for universities on the hosting of events that give a platform to hate preachers.", "article": "Coalition ministers are at war over Tory plans to ban hate preachers from English universities. David Cameron wants a total campus ban on extremists whose twisted views risk radicalising impressionable youngsters. Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable says only those who directly incite violence and terrorism should be prevented from exercising free speech. The row follows the unmasking of Islamic State murderer Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi who is believed to have been radicalised while studying at Westminster University. Home Secretary Theresa May wants tougher rules on campuses but Business Secretary Vince Cable warns it could force debates 'underground', where extreme views will go unchallenged. Security experts believe the freedom of extremists to operate at college campuses is a significant factor in the radicalisation of some young people. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps yesterday said Mr Cable, who has responsibility for universities, was wrong to resist the move. \u2018Vince Cable doesn\u2019t want to do what the Conservatives want to do, which is to make sure that on campus we do not have radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people,\u2019 he told Sky News. \u2018We have to put proper, decent, tough rules in place which don\u2019t ban free speech, but do prevent people from preaching death.\u2019 Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey said it was \u2018easy to demolish\u2019 the views of hate preachers if they were debated in public and warned that driving them underground would only increase their appeal. \u2018If these preachers are inciting violence, if they are saying it is OK to be a terrorist, if they are saying you can cut off people\u2019s heads, they can and should be arrested,\u2019 he said. 'Jihadi john' killer Mohammed Emwazi graduated from the University of Westminster (pictured) in 2009 with a degree in computing. The university has been described as a 'hotbed' for radicalism in the past but denies inciting extremism in any form. \u2018What the Conservatives seem to be wanting to do is to introduce, against British values of free speech, a new type of rule that says that the state will know what \u201cextremism\u201d is. The phrase \u201cextremism\u201d they are talking about is nebulous, it is unclear, and there is a danger the Conservatives will clamp down on free speech and that will be giving in to the terrorists.\u2019 The clash centres on new guidance for universities on the hosting of events that give a platform to hate preachers. Under the Prime Minister\u2019s plans, universities would have a duty to take a \u2018precautionary approach\u2019 to events featuring extremists. Vice-chancellors would be expected to cancel any event where there was a \u2018risk that the content will potentially draw people into terrorism\u2019. Home Secretary Theresa May said ministers were \u2018not talking about regulating legitimate debate \u2013 we\u2019re saying they [universities] need to do more to stop radicalisation on campus\u2019. The row means no action is likely before the election."}

Overcome with emotion: Samantha Green, 23, is seen being comforted by her public defender Traice Olson Friday after pleading not guilty to an upgraded charge of murder in the death of her newborn son. Higher stakes:\u00a0Prosecutors appealed to the judge to change Green's charge from manslaughter to murder after claiming to have uncovered new evidence. Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River last month after he and Green (left) were reported missing. In response, Green's public defender, Tracie Olson, demanded to be presented with the new information and accused the opposing side of moving the goalpost after her client had agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter, reported Sacramento Bee. Dressed in a striped green-and-white jumpsuit, Green appeared dejected and wept in court. Supervising Deputy District Attorney Rob Gorman declined to go into detail about the new evidence but defended the timing of the request to amend the complaint against Green. Gorman acknowledged that that while it may look \u2018suspicious,\u2019 the information they have obtained since Green\u2019s arraignment March 4 warranted the charge upgrade. \u2018We now believe that Ms. Green can be legitimately charged for murder,\u2019 said Gorman. Green, of Woodland, made her first court appearance last Wednesday following her weekend arrest in the death of her baby son. The original charges against Green also included an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son two and a half weeks ago, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. Last week, Green (pictured in court March 4) pleaded not guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge in her baby's death. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by\u00a0CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Justice had methamphetamine in his system at birth, reported KCRA, but Green and the boy's father were allowed to take him home after passing a drug test and agreeing to a safety plan put forward by Child Protective Services. Samantha Green was reported missing February 24 after she failed to visit her father, Randy, three days earlier, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook a day later begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fianc\u00e9 [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water.

Passerby Ricardo Villase\u00f1or then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough,\u00a0News 10 reported. Villase\u00f1or said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river.

He is the first high-profile player to walk away from his NFL career citing brain damage worries. His decision has caused a sensation within the sport and has sparked a discussion about the dangers of football and the need for more open conversations about concussions.", "article": "NFL rookie and San Francisco 49ers linebacker, Chris Borland, has revealed a concussion at football training camp led to the remarkable decision to quit his multi-million dollar contract at the age of only 24. Revealing that the injury forced a total rethink of his career just one year into his $3million contract, Borland said that he was happy to turn his back on fame and fortune and cause a sensation within his sport. Fearful of permanent brain damage due to frequent head trauma, Borland said, 'There was a moment in camp where I sustained a mild concussion and it wasn't something that was detrimental to my health immediately but it changed the way I viewed the risks of my chosen profession. Scroll Down for Video. Confession: Chris Borland told CBS' Face The Nation that a concussion he suffered during training camp led to a rethink of his NFL playing career. 'I didn't want to go down a route that could for years be ultimately detrimental to my health.' Speaking on Face The Nation, Borland revealed he told his parents his decision by writing a letter to them. '(I told them) My career may be brief. I did a lot of research during the season and afterwards and came to the conclusion it was best for me,' said Borland. Having made his mind up, Borland became the first high-profile player to walk away from his NFL career citing brain damage worries. 'The decision was simple after I had done a lot of research and it was personal,' Borland said to Face The Nation. 'I was concerned about neurological diseases down the road if I continued to play football, so I did a lot of research and gathered a lot of information and to me the decision made sense.' Sensation: San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma. Last week, the NFL moved quickly to head off the damage done by Borland as the league battles with the rising concern over the number of concussions that players are suffering during their playing days. The NFL's senior vice president of health and safety said that, by any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players.' 'We are seeing a growing culture of safety. Everyone involved in the game knows that there is more work to do and player safety will continue to be our top priority,' he said. However, Borland refuted that and said, 'football is inherently dangerous and that will never change.' While most people would consider walking away from a multi-million dollar contract to be madness, Borland said that at the very least he would want young players to stop playing if they were suffering a concussion. Backing: Tim Kawakami from the San Jose Mercury News Tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing. 'I love the visceral feeling of the violence of the game; I think everyone that plays at a high level is passionate about that,' he said to Face The Nation. 'However I don't think you shouldn't be informed and you should have every opportunity to know all you can about the dangers of that feeling that you love and the sport that you're passionate about.' Hitting back at those who said he played for one year just to take home a lucrative payday ahead of another player who wanted it more, Borland said that was not true. I'm paying back three fourths of my signing bonus. I'm only taking the money I've earned,' he said. 'This to me this is just about health and nothing else. I never played the game for money and attention. I love football and I've had a blast. I don't regret the last 10 years of my life at all. I'd do it over the exact same way.' The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. Culture change: His Tweet suggests that Borland's decision could mean putting him at the forefront of changing the perspectives of football. Legal concerns: NFL.com's Michael Silver suggested that people should take a step back from what Borland's retirement means for the 49ers and look at what it means for football as a whole. Knock-on effects: Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt said that Borland's retirement could allow for other players to have more open discussions about concussions. Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement. San Jose Mercury News's Tim Kawakami and NFL.com's Michael Silver highlighted what Borland's retirement meant for the larger sport of football. 'I used to think that 99% of players wouldn't be able to pull themselves away from this-- the game, the fame, the lifestyle. But...' Kawakami wrote. 'But the perspective is changing. Chris Borland just put himself at the forefront of that, and"}

The state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set. Crisp packets, empty fizzy drinks cans and plastic bags litter the floors of the squalid flat in the Cornish town. Bodmin, also known for its legendary beast, was where Poldark was set during its 1970s television adaptation. The grim photographs show debris piled up against the walls, with the floors of the heroin and crack cocaine den covered in needles, mouldy food and cigarette butts. The popular 1970s adaptations of the Poldark novels were set in the town, and a new BBC series based on the romantic novels was also filmed on Bodmin Moor. The first seven novels, set in the 18th centuries, tell the story of a Ross Poldark, a British Army officer who returns from the American Revolutionary War to find his fiancee, presuming he was dead, about to marry his cousin. The next five books focus on the children of the main characters and is largely set in the 19th century. Widely considered to be the one of the most successful television adaptations, Poldark is set to return to the BBC on Sunday with a new series. Many will be hoping the series encourages more tourists to the town, but the photographs from inside the drug den show it is not idyllic as the television programme makes it appear. The landlord of the two-bedroom flat evicted the tenants after discovering the state of the propert.

I had never seen anything like it in my life. I was a good Samaritan and tried to help this woman who was living on the streets and she gave me a \u00a3125 a week through housing benefit. 'She stayed for five months with her boyfriend and the flat turned into a drug supermarket. There were always coming and goings and I knew something dodgy was going on.

The entire A&E team at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, walked out on February 13 amid alleged rows with the management. On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned. In a damning open letter to the trust, four of the consultants branded the NHS trust a 'disgrace' and claimed they had been put under 'unbearable stress'. The 1,700 word letter, signed by Richard Morrell, Sarah Crawford, Christopher Hetherington and David Gemmell, said: 'The trust appears to tolerate massive overcrowding in the county's A&E departments. Four A&E consultants who resigned from the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch last month, have written an open letter to the trust branding it a 'disgrace' and claiming they were put under 'unbearable pressure' 'This is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all A&E staff. 'The situation has taken a heavy toll on our personal and family lives - the stress has been unbearable at times. 'We are battle-weary and exhausted by the continuous pressure that we have been under. 'We can no longer see a way forward to secure safe and sustainable A&E services at the Alexandra Hospital especially whilst the current senior management and senior clinical leadership remains in place.' The consultants also say they invested years of work into maintaining patient care but felt decisions made by the trust's management had 'undermined' services at the hospital. 'These in turn have led to the self-fulfilling prophecy of failing and unsustainable services,' they said. They added that they feared resources were 'heavily weighted' in favour of people in Worcester at the expense of patients in nearby Redditch who use the Alexandra Hospital. They also said they had raised concerns several times but believed they had not been listened to and felt they had no choice but to resign. The letter is not signed by the fifth consultant, who worked at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital. The NHS Trust has published a 720-word response in which it said they were 'disappointed' the consultants had not recognised the pressure the trust was under. A statement read: 'We are disappointed that our ED colleagues have not acknowledged the serious challenges to NHS services in this area that drove the need to review and reconfigure key medical services \u2013 changes that are essential to improve patient care across the entire county and beyond.' On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned. The Trust said it is disappointed the doctors did not recognise the pressure the NHS services in the area were under. It added:\u00a0'Unfortunately, recruitment efforts for years have failed to improve the shortfall of medical staff at the Alexandra Hospital, and this is predicted to cause potential risks for patients in the future. 'This means that some clinical departments need to be reorganised. Such decisions are never taken lightly. 'Change, even when essential for patient care, can be difficult and inconvenient for staff, but facts need to be faced and will not be altered if we fail to confront them. 'It would be better if the consultants had stayed to work with the trust to support the development of emergency services for the whole county.' The consultants' letter praised the team they worked with in the emergency department at the Alexandra Hospital. 'We have built a unit which is recognised for good patient care and excellent training,' they said. 'We have had the pleasure of encouraging a passion for Emergency Medicine in many trainees over the years who are now consultants all over the country. 'We would like to thank all of our A&E staff who have given us their unfailing support and loyalty over the years and helped us to build a quality service. 'All of them should be justly proud of their achievements which we and the patients have benefited from. 'We would also like to thank the many trainees, staff and patients who have made such kind comments over the last few difficult days - we have all been greatly moved.' The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust told MailOnline it is in discussions with a number of potential partners to replace the A&E team. Penny Venables, the Trust's chief executive said: 'We are disappointed that a number of our Emergency Department consultants have decided to leave us in order to work for another NHS Trust. 'But we are making strenuous efforts to ensure they are replaced and we are doing everything we can to ensure we maintain a continuous, high quality service for local patients. 'We have received offers of support from a number of individual A&E consultants and from neighbouring Trusts and we are now in discussions with various people as we seek to ensure continuity of service.'

Experts say that obese people often face obstacles in getting jobs, and that image is an important factor in the beauty industry. A survey of HR and recruitment professionals in America found that half of employers find obesity to be an undesirable trait.", "article": "A hairdresser claims obese workers ruined her business and lost her clients by prioritising food over customers. Zena Claire claims three former staff at her salon in Barnsley, south Yorkshire, were obese and faked appointments so they could sneak out to get takeaways. They also turned up eating a McDonald's when they should have been starting their shift. The 42-year-old mother of two said the three obese girls she employed caused her to lose clients and will make her think twice about employing severely overweight people in future. A salon owner said obese employees ruined her business after they booked in fake clients so they could go out on breaks or finish early to eat takeaways, or brought in fast food to eat before they started work. She said: 'It had a massive impact on my business. 'They were going to eat food rather than looking after clients. They were pretending to book clients in, having extended breaks and finishing early to go to the chippy.' Ms Claire estimates the three workers would book up to five fake appointments a week, costing her a considerable amount of money in lost bookings. She said when the non-existent clients did not turn up they could use the time to do nothing, or go out and get a KFC. She said they also brought in a McDonald's, which they would eat in the staff room at the start of the day - often cutting up to 40 minutes into their shifts. She told the Sun: 'One day five packs of caramel biscuits I'd left out were eaten all at once, along with two litres of orange juice.' 'I lost clients and product sales all because they prioritised food over work,' she added. The hairdresser said she will not ban obese people working for her in future because she will offer everyone an equal chance but the experience has made her think twice as she must base her decision on 'production value.' She claimed the girls were not attentive to clients and their lives'revolved around food.' Experts said the difficulty in getting a job if you are obese is quite prevalent among overweight people. About one in every four adults in the UK are classed as obese, and it is known that larger people often face obstacles in getting jobs. Tam Fry, director of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'Unfortunately it is quite prevalent that if you are overweight or fat and you are in a position where the public sees you or you are an ambassador of the establishment then there's a huge tendency not to give a job to anybody who isn't regarded by society as being as 'perfect' as possible. 'Also there are many jobs where being overweight actually could be a real problem at times of emergency. 'It's a truism to say that if you are fat, fat in the sense of just appearing to be fat, that's going to work against you. That's a very big wake-up call for young people to take a grip on themselves.' Ms Claire claims her three workers would book fake appointments so they could go out to get takeaways. Mr Fry said the question of obese workers was a difficult one in the beauty industry because if a person can do a job not allowing them to do so because of their weight is discrimination. However he said image is an important factor in the beauty industry, and any issues the employer has with their work must also be taken into consideration. Last year a survey of HR and recruitment professionals in America found that half of employers find obesity to be an undesirable trait. The study by researchers from Virginia Tech and the University at Buffalo found that when faced with the option of two candidates with identical qualities - the only difference being that one is obese - more than half of respondents said they would prefer to hire the candidate with a more healthy weight. Nearly 1million people in the UK are classed as morbidly obese, and thousands of adults are believed to get Disability Living Allowance because they are unable to work because of their size."}
{"abstract": "Bas Dost has been in sensational form since the start of 2015, scoring 13 goals in 8 matches and second only to Lionel Messi in Europe. His prolific form has almost secured Wolfsburg a place in the Champions League and a last 16 Europa League tie with Inter Milan. Dost has matured into the complete package, with his eye for goal, clinical finishing, aerial prowess and ability to hold the ball up.", "article": "Bas Dost must have rung in the New Year in some style. The Wolfsburg striker has been a transformed player since 2014 ticked over into 2015 and just can't stop scoring. Hardly prolific in the first-half of the season, with just one goal to his credit, the Dutchman is now Europe's hottest striker following a sensational run of form. Dost's double in Wolfsburg's thrilling 5-3 comeback win over Werder Bremen on Sunday took his 2015 tally to 13 goals in eight outings. Bas Dost celebrates yet another goal - this time in Wolfsburg's 5-3 win at Werder Bremen on Sunday. The tall Dutch striker jumps for joy after scoring for Wolfsburg against Hertha Berlin last weekend. January 30 - Two goals. Wolfsburg 4 Bayern Munich 1. February 7 - One goal. Wolfsburg 3 Hoffenheim 0. February 14 - Four goals. Bayer Leverkusen 4 Wolfsburg 5. February 19 - Two goals. Wolfsburg 2 Sporting Lisbon 0. February 22 - Two goals. Wolfsburg 2 Hertha Berlin 1. March 1 - Two goals. Werder Bremen 3 Wolfsburg 5. His total is second only to Barcelona's Argentine star Lionel Messi, who has 15 goals in 14 matches since the beginning of January. But arguably Dost's current form is more impressive, given that the Bundesliga only resumed on January 30 following its winter break. Having scored against Cologne in Wolfsburg's last fixture before the winter pause, Dost picked up where he'd left off with two against league leaders Bayern Munich on January 30. He then found the net in the home win over Hoffenheim on February 7, before scoring four in a remarkable 5-4 win at Bayer Leverkusen a week later. The run has continued, with Dost scoring two goals in each of Wolfsburg's matches with Sporting Lisbon, Hertha Berlin and Werder Bremen in the last fortnight. The 25-year-old's prolific form has pretty much sealed Wolfsburg a place in next season's Champions League - though they are eight points behind runaway leaders Bayern, they have a 10-point cushion from third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach. They are also through to a last 16 Europa League tie with Italian giants Inter Milan. Dost's form has also stolen the thunder of Andre Schurrle, who arrived at the Volkswagen Arena from Chelsea on deadline day for a fee of \u00a322m. 'Things keep going, and they're going well,' said Dost after his brace in Bremen. 'Every week I'm here saying that [the goals] will stop again, but I just keep going and we'll see where I am in the end.' Dost's form has ensured Wolfsburg are on course for a Champions League place. Dost celebrates after scoring in Wolfsburg's dramatic 5-3 win at Werder Bremen on Sunday. It hasn't always been so good for Dost. This is his third season in the Bundesliga and by some way his best - he scored 12 in 33 matches in his first season at Wolfsburg, then five in 15 last year. The 6ft 5in target man has prospered from an effective link up with the former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne, who has contributed six assists since the Bundesliga resumed in January. Born in the Dutch city of Deventer, Dost's first professional clubs were Emmen and Heracles Almelo, where 15 goals during the 2009-10 season led to rumours of a move to Ajax. In the end, the 20-year-old moved elsewhere in the Eredivisie to Heerenveen and realised his potential with two prolific seasons. In 2011-12, he scored a remarkable 38 goals in 39 matches in Dutch league and cup, finishing as the country's top goalscorer. Dost salutes the crowd at the Volkswagen Arena after scoring in the win over Hertha Berlin. Applying a cool finish to score against Hertha Berlin during the recent Bundesliga encounter. Inevitably, there was interest from the Premier League, with Dost turning down a \u00a37m move to Aston Villa at the time. Instead he moved to the Bundesliga and Wolfsburg, making an immediate impact with a stoppage time winner away to Stuttgart on his debut. Aside from that, his winner at defending champions Borussia Dortmund last season was also memorable. But it is this season that has seen Dost elevate his game to another level. Having started the campaign as Wolfsburg's third-choice striker, he is now indispensible. With his eye for goal, clinical finishing, aerial prowess and ability to hold the ball up, Dost has matured into the complete package, raising plenty of eyebrows throughout the football world."}

The city is believed to have been a shrine to a monkey God, and there are tales of a monkey stealing three women and creating half-monkey, half-human babies.", "article": "A team hunting for the legendary 'lost city' of Ciudad Blanca in Honduras has made a dramatic discovery of untouched ruins deep in the jungle that are thought to be thousands of years old, according to\u00a0National Geographic. Researchers believe the complex of plazas, mounds, a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace. It prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the White City, which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and Spanish explorers around the la Mosquita area of jungle in Honduras for hundreds of years. Some people call it the White City Of Gold, after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador Hernando Cortes to King Charles V of Spain in 1526. Since then countless adventurers have scoured the jungle for the ancient civilization, rumored to have enjoyed treasures beyond the wildest dreams of many budding Indiana Jones'. One such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the White City of the Monkey God, and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity, symbolized by a large statue. Theodore Morde, writing of his adventures in US  magazine The American Weekly, said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city. Locals even told him that one'monkey god' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half-human, half-chimp children. The children were then hunted for revenge. Local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist, according to a Honduran media report. Morde said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the Chorotegas, and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939-40. But Morde never revealed the location of his alleged find and killed himself in 1954. Scroll down for video. A sign of history? This block of stone could be a remnant of a temple built in the Lost City of Honduras thousands of years ago. Incredible: The aerial shots taken by National Geographic show luscious forestland where the City Of The Monkey God once thrived. However, despite archaeologists' following attempts to detect man-made structures - whether they be from Ciudad Blanca, The White City of the Monkey God or elsewhere - \u00a0have been unsuccessful. Until now. Traveling into uncharted territory last month, a National Geographic team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old. The National Geographic's Douglas Preston wrote: 'The tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth. Many more evidently lie below ground, with possible burials. 'They include stone ceremonial seats (called metates) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures. 'The most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what Fisher speculated might be 'a were-jaguar,' possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed, spirit state. 'Alternatively, the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of pre-Columbian life in Mesoamerica.' According to Theodore Morde, stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city's central temple, which was built in the shape of the monkey God. He described the myth: 'One day three of the hairy men who looked like great apes walked into an Indian village and carried off three of its most beautiful and pleasing maidens. 'They took the girls back into the caves high in the mountains to live with them and bear their children. 'From this union came, however, not human nor partly human children but the small Urus or monkeys.' Discovery? American explorer Theodore Morde (left) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador Hernando Cortes centuries before. Speaking to locals, he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured (right) hiding Rama and Sita, two more Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. The Honduran monkey God is more menacing, he said. The lost city, believed to be full of gold, has merited two names based on legends. Texts cite 'la Ciudad Blanca' or 'the White City' it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones. Other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey-shaped temple. There were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half-monkey, half-human babies, warranting the name: The City Of The Monkey God. Either way, it has been sought since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a"}

He is now back from the ban and is determined to help Chelsea win the Premier League.

He is, of course, pleased that Chelsea won their first trophy in his time at the club, though his joy is tempered by missing the Capital One Cup final through suspension. And though he is now back from that two-match ban, he was part of the Chelsea team which went out against 10-man Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday. He earned his two-match ban for pushing over Ashley Barnes in fury after the Burnley player executed an excessive shin-high challenge on him. Matic received a red card and didn\u2019t even get the free-kick, Barnes went unpunished. Ashley Barnes commits a foul on Nemanja Matic but referee Martin Atkinson fails to blow for the foul. Matic was handed a two-match suspension for pushing Burnley's Barnes at Stamford Bridge. The 28-year-old has missed Chelsea's last two games against Tottenham and West Ham due to suspension. But Matic maintains a degree of perspective. He is aware he is fortunate not to be have been injured far more seriously. \u2018I was happy, to be honest, when I saw the video after the game as it was bad. And I am happy that I played against Paris Saint-Germain. My reaction was not good but this reaction was because I thought I broke a leg. I am a happy man because I can walk,\u2019 he said. \u2018I don\u2019t like to say that I was right in my reaction. I was not right. But this was a moment when you cannot control your emotions. I saw it one time only (on TV). That was enough. But these things happen in football. I hope that is the last time.\u2019 Matic has been a revelation since returning to Chelsea from Portuguese side Benfica last January. Matic will not discuss the fact that referee Martin Atkinson did not award a foul, let alone punish Barnes for the tackle. \u2018I think that the referee saw because he was close but I think it\u2019s not my job to comment on that,\u2019 he said. \u2018People have been speaking about that, writing in newspapers. That\u2019s it.\u2019 Asked whether Barnes had apologised, he said: \u2018No.\u2019 Before the visit of Southampton on Sunday, Matic reflected on his ban and keeping focused. \u2018It has been very hard, it is very difficult when you are not on the pitch,\u2019 he said. Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic  with the trophy after the Capital One Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. \u2018When you are on the pitch you can do something. When you are out, you are just watching and it is very difficult for me, I am not used to it. I hope this is the last time I am out. \u2018It has been difficult. But I was happy. I was out but I was happy because we won two games.\u2019 Matic is a candidate for player of the year, so impressive have his performances been since he came back to Chelsea last January in a \u00a322million deal, having initially been allowed to leave and join Benfica in 2011. Chelsea re-signed Nemanja Matic last January for \u00a322million having previously been sold by the club in 2011. Matic admitted it was hard to miss the Capital One Cup Final win against Tottenham Hotspur. Matic does not attempt to gild the failure against PSG, and is aware of what is now required. \u2018To be honest we didn\u2019t play well against Paris Saint-Germain,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018We played against one very good team with very good individuals but after the Ibrahimovic red card maybe we thought it would be more \u2014 not easy \u2014 but easier for us as we had one player more. If you watched the whole game they deserved to go through. \u2018Now, we must win the Premier League. We have to if we want to finish this as a good season. If we win the league we will have that and the Capital One Cup and it will be a good season. Otherwise it is going to be bad. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is sent off for his part in a tackle with Chelsea's Brazilian ace Oscar. Chelsea's players surround the referee as he sends off  Ibrahimovic (second right) in the first half. \u2018I know it is going to be difficult until the end. But Manchester City also play difficult games. \u2018If we win the Premier League it\u2019s going to be like a dream for us, because we know what we speak about every day and we know the Premier League is something we have to win. We are not tired and we will be ready for the next 12 games.\u2019 None more so than Matic. He knows how close he has come to missing out."}

Clinton, 67, is the presumptive Democratic White House front-runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to become president after the 2016 elections. That would make her the second-oldest chief executive to move into the White House behind only Ronald Reagan, who took office 17 days before he turned 70. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. BORN IN 1947: Hillary Clinton, shown Tuesday at the United Nations, kept a grueling schedule as secretary of state but she would be the second-oldest president ever inagurated if she were to win in 2016. JUNIOR CLASS VICE PRESIDENT: In this 1964 Illinois high school yearbook photo, the future US first lady was likely 16 years old. When then-Senator Clinton ran for president in 2008, she was 61. A 73-year-old Reagan famously quipped in a 1984 debate against Democrat Walter Mondale, then 56, that he wouldn't make age an issue in his re-election campaign. 'I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,' he said during a memorable debate. The new video, from a trio calling themselves the 'Calculating Clinton' project, shows Mrs. Clinton in 28 separate photos, each morphing into the next at 2-second intervals. One of the project's creators told Daily Mail Online that his partners include a social media executive and a professional videographer. 'I don't think her age disqualifies her from becoming president, but her politics and tactics are definitely relics of the 90s.' he said, requesting anonymity because his job doesn't involve partisan politicking. 'Our video is simply an exercise in branding. We have no money behind us,' he added, calling the effort 'just three young professionals interested in reaching people using nontraditional tactics and messages that break through the noise and stick with people.' He said there will be more videos hitting the project's YouTube page if Mrs. Clinton takes the plunge and runs for president. There's no indication most Americans today believe age should be a disqualifying factor for a presidential run. One poll even indicates Clinton has hid hers well. A Pew Research Center survey released a year ago found that 'the public\u00a0tends to underestimate Hillary Clinton\u2019s age,' with 60 being the median guess. A whopping 53 per cent of young voters, those under age 30, told Pew's pollsters that Mrs. Clinton was in her 50s. Another 16 per cent said she was younger than 50. Age perceptions appeared to be the least of her problems on Tuesday.

WHITE HOUSE YEARS: Then-first lady Clinton pictured (left to right) in 1993, 1995 and 1997. After a United Nations session on women's global progress where a South African diplomat introduced her to cheers as a 'future president,' she faced a gauntlet of hungry reporters in an attempt to explain an email scandal that has brought her an undesirable form of public attention. Mrs. Clinton told them that she had used only a personal email account hosted on a private server during her four years as secretary of state. She also said more than 30,000 personal emails were deleted, none of them vetted by the State Department for materials subject to the Federal Records Act. That law requires public servants to preserve an archive of all communications related in any way to their jobs. Clinton, who has been an attorney, the first lady of Arkansas and the United States, a U.S. senator and America's top diplomat, is expected to make a decision on running for president \u2013 or staying on the sidelines \u2013 next month.

Now fully healed, Otter and his daughter Jenna are the subjects of an episode of ABC's In an Instant, which dramatizes the events as they unfolded on a trail at Glacier National Park. The bear seemed to come out of nowhere, Otter recalled, along with her two cubs. Scroll down for video. Lucky: Johan Otter was savagely mauled by a bear in Montana ten years ago and is now speaking out about the harrowing tale. 'She could have touched it -- basically that close,' Otter says of his daughter. 'So she stepped back real fast and just naturally, as a parent, you step in front of your kid.' 'The worst fear of a parent is to hear your child scream,' a tearful Otter told In an Instant. That's when the mama bear attacked, tearing off nearly 80 percent of Otter's scalp, breaking his neck and gouging his right eye. 'All I see is claws and teeth,' Otter said. 'The bear kind of goes like this on it, basically digging for a bone, which is your skull and biting on it like this.' Despite the massive wounds, Otter says he remained standing and in a in instant decided the only way to survive was to leap off the mountain. His daughter, who also sustained life threatening injuries, eventually did the same and the two ended up on the same mountain ledge. But not before the bear turned its attention to Jenna. Horrific: Otter's neck was broken and one of his eyes gouged by the angry mother bears claw. The bear kind of goes like this on it, basically digging for a bone, which is your skull and biting on it like this,' recalled Otter, who lost most of his scalp in the attack. 'The bear stood over me and it put one paw on either side of my head,' Jenna recalled. 'The bear took my head in its mouth. Its lower jaw was kind of around my jaw. It's upper jaw was around the back of my head. 'When it bit me, I didn't feel pain, just pressure,' she said. Thinking fast, Jenna played dead and the bear wandered off. The immediate danger was gone, but the looming threat of their massive injuries remained. Jenna began to scream for help and soon some passing hikers were able to call for help. Unfortunately, the mother and father could not be pulled from the mountain for another three hours. An arduous recovery followed for Otter, but the Escondido, California man prevailed. According to\u00a0UTSanDiego.com, he's even managed to run the Boston Marathon six times since the ordeal. The attack occurred on a remote trail, which made the subsequent rescue painfully difficult. After Otter was mauled to the brink of death, the bear went after Jenna. She was left with broken vertebrae and a lacerated skull (grab from ABC's In an Instant) Otter's daughter Jenna has also fully recovered and is now in her fourth year of medical school at prestigious Columbia University. She recalled to ABC what she was thinking during the terrifying ordeal. 'I just thought that we would die, it's too bad that I'm not going to live past 18,' she recalls thinking. Thankfully, and miraculously, Jenna was wrong. She's now working towards becoming an emergency room physician. And while her father still has residual PTSD from the attack, the family continues to hike the same area where he was nearly killed.

For while Gus Poyet may have vowed to fight on in the wake of Saturday\u2019s 4-0 humiliation at home to Aston Villa, Monday\u2019s dismissal as head coach of Sunderland would have come as a mighty relief. Poyet has long since lost faith in his vision for Sunderland. Frustrated by the influence of sporting director Lee Congerton in transfers, he was left with a dysfunctional team made up of players signed by both himself and the club hierarchy. Gus Poyet was sacked as Sunderland manager on Monday with the club one point above the relegation zone. Poyet was dismissed following the Black Cats' 4-0 Premier League defeat at home to Aston Villa on Saturday. Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon looks dejected as Sunderland were thrashed 4-0 at home by Villa. Gabriel Agbonlahor (centre) scored two of Aston Villa's goals in the 4-0 win on Saturday.

VIDEO\u00a0Poyet sacked as Sunderland manager. 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Some of Poyet\u2019s press-conference outbursts distanced him from the personnel on the pitch and were not well received at boardroom level. \u2018I am not going to be a head coach when it suits and a manager when it doesn\u2019t,\u2019 he said in December. \u2018It is clear what we need to do. That is down to recruitment. So, if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it, you are lucky. If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t ask me.\u2019 Such comments would not have been tolerated at other clubs and Congerton informed owner Ellis Short that Poyet was not the man to take them forward. Poyet grew particularly disillusioned during January and when he let coach Charlie Oatway take a pre-match and half-time team talk there was a feeling he had lost interest. Subsequent team selections left players and senior figures baffled - four central midfielders named in the starting XI versus Hull, who play with wing-backs, being the most alarming example. Poyet had lost his faith in his vision for Sunderland and was fed up sporting director Lee Congerton (centre) Poyet advised his son Diego to sign for West Ham last July rather than join him at the Stadium of Light. But the players should not escape criticism, either. This is the third manager, following Martin O\u2019Neill and Paolo Di Canio, who has been sacked with the core of the current squad on the books. They have fought relegation during the past two seasons and have survived despite falling short of 40 points on each occasion. The squad has gone stale and so had Poyet. He did not think the players were good enough to implement the attractive football he craved. Certainly, not once was there any evidence of such a brand of play during his 17 months in charge. Tellingly, the Uruguayan also advised his son Diego to sign for West Ham last July rather than join him at the Stadium of Light. Then there was his failure to promote from within the club\u2019s academy, a major source of contention among staff who work with the youngsters. Indeed, they were miffed at the sight of assistant boss Mauricio Taricco joining in first-team sessions rather than sending for one of their players. But Poyet\u2019s refusal to entertain academy prospects - not one such player started a game during his tenure - was symptomatic of his loss of love for the project on Wearside. Results, if not performances, were always just enough - 14 draws this season - to keep talk of a crisis in the background. Poyet was appointed by Sunderland in October 2013 following the sacking of\u00a0Paolo Di Canio. But discord and discontent rumbled all the while and only now is it all being laid bare after the situation unravelled on the pitch in such shambolic fashion at the weekend.

Barbara Mikulski has opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office.", "article": "Washington (CNN)Democrats who have gleefully watched Republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own. As the party works to retake control of the Senate in 2016, Democrats are looking at a Senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time. It's a big shift from recent years when Republicans, riven by long-standing ideological fault lines, faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries, usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots. Memorably, in 2010 and 2012, the fights were so damaging that Republicans failed to pick up winnable Senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates. Democrats, for the most part, have not had to face the same problem. But that might be changing. While the fields of candidates are still taking shape, a platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. While many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns, none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help Democrats avoid a primary bonanza, and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity. Republican primary battles aren't going anywhere in 2016, and on the presidential level, Democrats continue to line up behind Hillary Clinton as their nominee, without a whiff a serious primary challenge. But there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the Senate, where the question is whether Democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights, jeopardizing the party's hopes of regaining control of the the Upper Chamber. \"The great irony of Democrats celebrating fissures amongst Republicans in recent years is that historically they're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the GOP,\" said Josh Holmes, a former top strategist to Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. \"Now we're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their Senate chances.\" Democrats scoff at the idea, claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a Senate win against the many Republicans up for re-election next year. Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, seven of them are held by Republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the Senate. \"Unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable Republican senators, there are no Todd Akins here, and there isn't a single state on the map with a Democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state,\" said Justin Barasky, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's communications director. Akin, of course, was the GOP nominee in Missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about \"legitimate rape.\" Last cycle, Barasky said, Democrats witnessed hotly contested Senate primaries in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of those fights were in blue states, of course. But none of them resulted in a November loss for Democrats. Republicans, though, are hoping to breathe life into the narrative, especially with Democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of Florida and Ohio. \"Democrats are facing messy primaries in key Senate races across the country, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight,\" said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"The infighting is so bad that it's not just limited to candidates in key races, but is even playing out between Harry Reid and the DSCC in Washington.\" The most crowded lane, for now, appears to be in Maryland, where five-term Sen. Barbara Mikulski is retiring. In a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections, the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office. With the exception of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, nearly every Democrat in Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the Senate seat. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake have also been floated as contenders. Despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates, the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party's play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed Rep. Chris Van Hollen for the seat, a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner. The DSCC, however, has not picked a side in the race. Progressive groups, meanwhile, have championed a known figure from their community: Rep. Donna Edwards, who joined the race last week vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, \"no ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers.\" That was seen as a poke at Van Hollen, who said in 2012 he was \"willing to consider\" entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations. But even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over"}

Terry revealed his duties as a young player included cleaning Wise's boots and making hot drinks for senior players at Chelsea's old Harlington training ground - a far cry from the facilities the club's youngsters enjoy at their world-class Cobham base now. But easily the strangest thing that Terry did to impress was make sure the likes of Wise, Kevin Hitchcock and Michael Duberry did not have to sit on cold toilet seats. John Terry may be Chelsea captain now, but when Dennis Wise was skipper and Terry was a junior player at the club, his duties included warming toilet seats for senior players, making drinks and cleaning boots. John Terry (left) warmed up toilet seats for Dennis Wise and his senior Chelsea team-mates as a young player and would receive \u00a325 from Wise every time the former captain scored while wearing boots cleaned by Terry. Terry grew from a young player to a senior member of the side during training sessions at Harlington. 'I'd do anything for them,' Terry said. 'I'd make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground. It's bizarre when you think about it but that was part of growing up.' Terry, now earning around \u00a3150,000-a-week as one of Chelsea's key players, used to take a tip of \u00a325 from Wise whenever the feisty midfielder scored with the boots Terry had cleaned. 'I used to clean his boots and he wanted them perfect so I took really good care of them,' Terry told Chelsea Pitch Owners. 'Every now and then he gave me a little bonus. Every time he scored I was on \u00a325, which was half my wages at the time! I used to be praying we'd get a penalty or he'd score.' Jon Harley, Wise and Terry (L-R) pose in Chelsea kit ahead of an Umbro launch back in 2001. Wise's boots were cleaned by Terry and he used to give his eventual successor as captain a \u00a325 tip. But Terry could not just rely on his toilet-warming skills to get him noticed by the senior players. 'I would go in and win tackles against first team players, and  I remember at the time people were going, \u201cOoh, you can\u2019t do that\",' he said. 'Sometimes, the foreign guys especially, didn\u2019t like it. Dan Petrescu, once, he got me round the throat, and said \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d 'The first one over, to back me up, was Wisey: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say, you say it to me, not the younger players.\u201d Me and Dan laugh about it now.' Terry also revealed how current manager Jose Mourinho prevents complacency from creeping in. 'Sometimes you're losing a game at half-time, which doesn't happen often at this club, and you expect to come in and get a rollicking,' Terry said. 'But you come in and the manager is calm, collected, the complete opposite. He's like, \"Listen, we're going to win the game. We're going to get an early goal\" and he talks you through it.' While Mourinho's calmer side has been used to get his team through difficult periods, such as when they were drawing 2-2 with Hull City at half-time on Sunday after taking an early two-goal lead, he can also operate at the other end of the scale. 'Other times you'll be winning 2-0 or 3-0 and you'll come in happy at half-time and he'll go ballistic. 'Tables will go over, bottles of water will go flying. You think \"where's that come from?\" 'But you go out for the second half and win the game 5-0 rather than scraping through 3-1, 3-2. 'He knows when players take their foot off the gas. He can sense something before the game. He just gets a feel for everyone and every single game. And I look at that and think no one else has got that that I\u2019ve experienced.' Terry says Dan Petrescu was not pleased with the way Terry went around tackling the seniors in training. Terry is now Chelsea's longest-serving player but youngsters do not have to do what he used to do. The Chelsea captain has led his side to the top of the Barclays Premier League this season."}

His appeal lies in his willingness to put forward bold ideas to tackle issues of race and inequality, though there are many skeptics who don't think he has what it takes to win.", "article": "(CNN)Sen. Rand Paul, who is expected to announce on April 7 that he will be running for the presidency, is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism. The Kentucky senator's widely publicized appearance this month at the South by Southwest festival at Austin, Texas, was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech-savvy audience. His particular blend of ideas -- a combination of libertarianism and Republican conservatism -- stands out from the rest of the pack. Younger Republicans, the much-desired millennial vote, seem attracted by what they are hearing. What accounts for his appeal? In an era when so many Americans seem frustrated with shallow, personality-based politics, there seems to be genuine interest in a candidate who is fighting for a set of ideas. For many disaffected younger Republicans, Paul offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern GOP. For almost half a century, \"big government conservatism\" has ruled the party. Although conservatism is theoretically about limited government, the historical reality has been much different. On national defense, the hawks of the GOP have been victorious. Even while railing against the dangers of a big federal government, Republicans have lined up to support higher defense spending and a massive military-industrial complex. Though the GOP has little tolerance for many social safety net programs, the party has accepted sizable government support to industry, such as the financial bailout known as TARP in 2008 and subsidies for certain economic interests. Paul has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the GOP has embraced in recent decades, during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation-building and regime change. For some Republicans, including Paul, these policies were at the heart of the failures of George W. Bush's presidency and a sharp departure from the party's principles. Similarly, Paul has been one of the few Republican voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties. At the local level, he has criticized the militarization of police forces and the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement officers. Paul has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that don't sit well with a growing number of Republican voters. He has been an outspoken advocate of giving states the right to legalize marijuana. He has been attuned to the ways in which younger generations of Republicans are not on board with the evangelical fervor of the 1970s conservative movement and want to move in a different direction. While many Republicans have talked about the need for their party to tackle issues involving race and inequality in ways that are different from Democrats, most have been unwilling to offer any substantive ideas. Indeed, the recent budget blueprint from congressional Republicans exposed how thin discussions of a Republican anti-poverty program are. Their budget centers around cuts to key social safety net programs such as Medicare and regressive supply side tax cuts. But Paul, who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget, has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas, including criminal justice reform, that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated African American communities. Can Paul really win? That is unclear. Republican strategist Matthew Dowd told The New York Times: \"It's one thing to be interesting; it's another thing to be compelling. They've got to see him sitting in the Oval Office. And I do not think Rand has crossed that threshold yet.\" There are many skeptics who don't think that he has what it takes and that he has a controversial record. Paul's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will certainly come back to bite him, as will some of his blistering attacks on the Federal Reserve. Paul is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure. Paul is still a Republican, so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the GOP. He is also a politician at heart and will make compromises that he believes are essential to survive. While Paul argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable, some of his supporters smell a sellout. Arguably, we have seen this recently when he signed the controversial letter to Iran led by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas (a neoconservative mentored by the hawkish Bill Kristol), switched his approach to the issue of same-sex marriage and gave support to an aggressive war against ISIS. \"This is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip,\" the editor of an anti-war website told the Daily Beast. \"This was the last straw. I've put up with a lot from that guy! I've had to defend him like a Jesuit. I'm done. Let somebody else do it.\" But if Rand Paul can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the Republican candidates, at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the GOP by raising questions about some of the party's"}

In Gabriel, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor, and \u2013 just like in the capital of Havana \u2013 posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere. While life goes on as normal in 'the real Cuba', talks continue to take place between US and Cuban officials to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. The old Cold War foes are claiming progress after a second round of discussions to end a half-century diplomatic freeze. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other\u2019s capitals, although a few hurdles remain, including Cuba\u2019s place on the US state sponsor of terrorism blacklist. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities. It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, and there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity. In Gabriel, Cuba, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, and goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor. The US is planning to ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba, a former Cold War foe, after agreeing to restore ties severed since 1961. While most US tourists will likely stick to Havana or all-inclusive resorts on the sea once the ban on travel is lifted, rural villages who do welcome foreigners are not prepared to handle them in large numbers. Many lack running water, suitable accommodation and modern facilities, including toilets. With Cuba poised to open itself up to a massive market for holidaymakers, tourists from outside the US are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised'. Rural villages are not prepared to handle foreign tourists in large numbers, as there are very few modern facilities. With many issues unresolved, the US is hoping to reach agreement on reopening embassies in time for a regional summit in Panama in April. Some travel experts are encouraging tourists to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture. In rural Cuba, villagers make a living by selling vegetables, fruit and meat from local farms. The number of tourists visiting Havana has seen a steady increase following the normalisation of Cuba-US relations last year. While the landmark thaw in relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go before it changes forever. TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson recently told MailOnline Travel: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other\u2019s capitals, although a few hurdles remain. One of the biggest hurdles is Cuba's place on a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, from which Cuba is pushing to be removed. Tourists on a double-decker bus take in the sights, including a local football match, during a tour of Havana, Cuba's capital. If the US lifts its restrictions on travel and trade, one of the biggest draws for American tourists could be Major League Baseball games. 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. If restrictions are lifted and Cuba becomes a popular destination for US tourists once again, one of the biggest draws could be the countries\u2019 shared love of baseball. Major League Baseball is considering playing spring exhibition games on the baseball-mad island nation, where American teams played before Fidel Castro came to power. Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and \u201850s, and there have been discussions to bring them back to the country once the governments officially end the diplomatic freeze."}

Sam Twiston-Davies rode Dodging Bullets to victory, while Sprinter Sacre and Sire De Grugy were unable to compete. The success of Dodging Bullets is attributed to his maturity and the treatment of a gastric ulcer.", "article": "This meeting is fast turning into a gala performance by the double act of Irish champion trainer Willie Mullins and his British counterpart Paul Nicholls. Having seen Mullins, ably assisted by stable jockeys Ruby Walsh and Paul Townend, smash the home team on Tuesday with four winners headed by his Champion Hurdler Faugheen, it was Nicholls\u2019 turn on Wednesday. He won the feature \u00a3350,000 Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase with Dodging Bullets as well as the Coral Cup with Aux Ptits Soins, both ridden by stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies, and the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle with Qualando, the mount of Nick Scholfield. Dodging Bullets (front) delivered a second winner of day two for jockey Sam Twiston-Davies. With Mullins also landing the RSA Chase with Bryan Cooper-ridden Don Poli, the two dominant stables in jump racing have now won eight of the 14 Festival races run so far. Nicholls denied he had driven home on Tuesday depressed or frustrated having drawn a blank in the face of the Mullins\u2019 mullering. But the mood for the journey home last night must have been some contrast. Almost amazingly, Dodging Bullets\u2019 one-and-a-quarter length defeat of 33-1 shot Somersby was the first steeplechase Nicholls had won at this meeting since Kauto Star landed the 2009 Gold Cup. Back in third was Irish-trained front-runner Special Tiara but the big two \u2014 2013 winner Sprinter Sacre and last year\u2019s champion Sure De Grugy \u2014 blew out. Trainer Gary Moore and jockey son Jamie felt the ground had dried out too much for fourth-placed Sire De Grugy, who has endured an injury-plagued season while Sprinter Sacre, a spent force by the home turn, was pulled up before the last by his jockey Barry Geraghty. Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets successfully clear a fence on their way to victory. Twiston-Davies laps up the applause as he is led in after winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase. His trainer Nicky Henderson said there was no evidence Sprinter Sacre\u2019s old fibrillating heart problem had affected his gelding and a scope examination showed no signs of a significant blood vessel break. However, the feeling was an old breathing issue might have re-surfaced. There will be no snap decisions but there must be a chance he has run his last race. Henderson said: \u2018It is disappointing for everybody who has worked their socks off to get him back.\u2019 The outcome once again showed how hard it is to come back and the result had echoes of the 2010 Gold Cup won by Imperial Commander when the focus was on the Nicholls-trained pair of Kauto Star and Denman. This time it was the turn of 9-2 shot Dodging Bullets, winner of this season\u2019s Tingle Creek and Clarence House Chases, to be cold-shouldered in the build-up as the spotlight fell on the big two. And there to cheer him home was his breeder, three-time champion Flat jockey Frankie Dettori, looking like he should be part of Elliot Ness\u2019s crew in his brown trilby and mac. He hoped he was breeding a future Derby winner when he sent the mare Nova Cyngi to the stallion Dubawi. He ended up producing the victor of one the season\u2019s biggest jumps races. Dettori said: \u2018I am only a small part in this amazing story but I am so pleased for Paul and the owners. I can say I have bred the best jumps horse of 2015.\u2019 Dodging Bullets returned at 9-2 after landing the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Twiston-Davies celebrates with the Queen Mother Champion Chase trophy. The result was no surprise to Nicholls, who said: \u2018He was the form horse. He beat Sprinter Sacre at Ascot and I couldn\u2019t see how he could turn that around. With all due respect to Gary Moore, I also thought Sire De Grugy had it all to do. He has had a problem. \u2018I can see the sentiment side of it but the progressive horse normally comes out on top. I was fairly confident I had them covered, Champagne Fever was the one I was getting worried about and he was a non-runner.\u2019 Nicholls puts Dodging Bullets\u2019 improvement this year down to greater maturity and solving a gastric ulcer problem, as he has with tomorrow\u2019s Gold Cup favourite Silviniaco Conti. This success can only serve to strengthen both stable and punter confidence in his chance. Nicholls added: \u2018We felt he was losing his way but couldn\u2019t work out why. We found the gastric ulcer, treated for that,"}

Amazon has not commented on the movement yet, but Miller's supporters are continuing to push for the change.", "article": "(CNN)Many years ago, a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by \"Amazon Mom,\" a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts, recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years. In bold print, the company says the program is \"open to anyone, whether you're a mom, dad, grandparent, or caretaker.\" But still it is called \"Amazon Mom,\" irking my colleague's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies. 'Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads. My friend's husband was not alone. A petition created a few years ago calls on Amazon to change the name of the program from \"Amazon Mom\" to \"Amazon Family.\" But the drive didn't get much traction. That changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger, Oren Miller, who created a Facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members. In 2013, Miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get Amazon to change the name of the program. \"Why did Amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the UK? What made them realize they couldn't get away with calling it 'Amazon Mom,' and why do they get away with it here?\" Miller wrote. \"Someone actually started a petition to change the name to 'Amazon Family' in the US, and so far it has less than 100 signatures. Why is that? Why are we OK with letting England be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood? They have a queen! They are ruled by a freakin' queen! We can do better than that!\" he wrote. No more dumb old dad: Changing the bumbling father stereotype. I had the pleasure of interviewing Miller for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit. The 42-year-old stay-at-home father of two, who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014. Miller, of Owings Mills, Maryland, died Saturday. Now, members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor, trying to step up the pressure on the Internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times. Mike Heenan, a stay-at-home father of two in Northern California and founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters, never got to meet Miller but says that when Miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers, it changed his life. \"He got me writing again, inspired me to publish, to contribute, to tell my story... to be a better dad for my daughters.\" Heenan, like several other dad bloggers, took to Twitter using the #AmazonFamilyUS hashtag to call for Amazon to make the change. \"The push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and, like Oren, many of us think the change to 'Amazon Family' is a no-brainer,\" Heenan said. Judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad. Buzz Bishop, a father of two in Calgary, Alberta, and founder of the blog Dad Camp, points out how Amazon calls its program \"Amazon Family\" in Germany, Japan, Austria, France and Canada as well as the United Kingdom. \"So why is it called 'Amazon Mom' in America?\" Bishop wrote in a blog post. \"We are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the Dad Bloggers Facebook group, Oren Miller,\" wrote Bishop. \"In his name, we want to finish the job.\" The petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures. Amazon has not commented on the movement. In the meantime, Miller's supporters won't stop pushing. I hope they never do.

The Army Times\u00a0first reported on the racist behavior after several soldiers, who wished to remain anonymous, came forward. One staff sergeant, who is black, told the newspaper this week: 'When I first got to my unit, someone said we should do ''Racial Thursdays'' because it's been a tradition. 'It's something they made up where you can say any racist remark you want without any consequences. The platoon sergeant said no, but the s*** is still going on.' A platoon based at Fort Wainwright in Alaska (pictured) has been placed under investigation after it emerged that they were holding 'Racial Thursdays' - when any racist remark was allowed without consequence.

'Racial Thursdays' have allegedly been taking place at the same unit where Private Danny Chen once belonged, The Army Times reported. The 19-year-old infantryman from New York City shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan in October 2011 after what investigators described as weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs. The young soldier endured attacks on a daily basis for six weeks from fellow soliders who singled him out for being Chinese-American. He was taunted with the slurs 'gook', 'chink' and 'dragon lady', according to reports, beaten and put on excessive guard duty to the point of exhaustion. The day of his death he was made to crawl 100 yards over gravel carrying equipment while rocks were thrown at him by fellow soldiers. In December  2011, the Army charged eight soldiers with various crimes relating to Chen's death. Four soldiers were ultimately court-martialed. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, the U.S. Army in Alaska said: 'We are already aware of these allegations, as an informal complaint was made through command channels about this alleged behavior. The command has assigned an investigating officer and the investigation is ongoing. The command is extremely sensitive to any complaints that involve equal opportunity or discrimination and will investigate every allegation. 'It's important to emphasize that these allegations are just that. They're allegations, and that's what the investigation has been assigned to find out, exactly what happened and if anything happened. 'Based on the results of that inquiry, and if the evidence supports it, the commander, usually the brigade commander, can elect to conduct a 15-6 investigation. 'Treating all soldiers with dignity and respect is something this command takes extremely seriously, and when there are any indications that those values are not being followed, the command will absolutely make inquiries, conduct appropriate investigations and take action as necessary.'"}

French minister\u00a0Segolene Royal (left) has hit back after George Osborne repeatedly contrasted the UK's strong recovery with the sluggish growth and high unemployment on the other side of the Channel. In his Budget statement last week, Mr Osborne made several references to Britain's strong growth compared to France. He mocked the high rate of French unemployment, quipping that one English county - Yorkshire - had created more jobs than the whole of France. He pointed to forecasts suggesting the British economy grew by 2.6 per cent last year, '50 per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the euro-zone \u2013 and seven times faster than France'.

A would-be Liberal Democrat MP has been suspended by the party and withdrawn his candidacy after being questioned by police over historic child sex allegations. Jason\u00a0Zadrozny, who was due to stand as an MP in the marginal Ashfield seat, was questioned by officers yesterday over allegations relating to the abuse of a 16-year-old boy. Today Mr Zadrozny issued a statement saying he'vehemently' denies the allegations and was withdrawing from the general election while he fights to clear his name. He said: 'I am today withdrawing my candidacy as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Ashfield and Eastwood Constituency. 'Yesterday I was questioned by Nottinghamshire Police about historic allegations, some of which are over ten years old. 'I am in full cooperation with the police and vehemently refute the allegations. 'I have spent the last ten years championing the cause of the Liberal Democrats both locally and nationally and I do not want this allegation to detract from the real issues facing local residents in the upcoming elections. 'Therefore I will step down with immediate effect as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate to spend my time clearing my name.'

Since finding fame, she has been off benefits for a year and has lost three stone, and is now planning to release a fitness DVD.", "article": "Prime Minister David Cameron is often accused of being out of touch with the British public because of his privileged background. So now Dee Kelly, aka White Dee from Benefits Street, says she can give disillusioned voters a voice - as she intends to run for parliament in the future. The 43-year-old mother-of-two, who found fame thanks to reality TV, says she's always been passionate about politics. Scroll down for video. Dee Kelly, aka White Dee, on today's This Morning where she said she's considering a career in politics. 'I have always been interested in politics, I'm interested in the country and the people of the country so it's something I may go into in a couple of years,' she said on today's This Morning. Dee, from Birmingham, said she won't throw her hat into the political ring just yet as she wants to wait for a time when she will be voted for based on her policies and not her celebrity status. She said: 'It's something I want to do because I'm passionate it about it and if my policies are good. I want to get in because of my policies, not because I'm topical.' She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden she would be a good candidate to represent constituents because she has the 'right ideas' and 'feel for what real people are like'. The Benefits Street star told Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that she would want people to vote for her based on her policies and not because she's topical. Dee starred in Benefits Street in January 2014, filmed on James Turner Street in Birmingham. The fly-on-the-wall documentary followed her and her friends and neighbours as they lived their lives on benefits. She went on to star in Celebrity Big Brother in the summer of 2014 alongside Lauren Goodger and Edele Lynch, where she was voted the fifth most popular housemate. As a result of the fortune fame has brought her, she's been off benefits for a year. But she said she still feels she suffers from the stigma of having relied on handouts. Dee, pictured left today, has lost three stone since she first found fame in 2014, right. She said: 'It's a touchy subject, I have always said you have people who are happy on benefits and that's why hard workers get annoyed but for others, it's not a choice, it's where they are at that particular time. 'People still tell me to get a job.' Dee admitted despite now having an income, she's not sure what her job title is. After recently losing three stone, she currently has plans to release a fitness DVD. She said losing weight has made her feel happier and healthier so she wants to share the secret to her success with others. Dee pictured on Channel 4's Benefits Street. She no longer takes handouts thanks to the fortune she's made through her fame on the show. She said: 'I have always had low confidence, I come across as gobby but I'm a shy person and private person. 'It's about having motivation to get off sofa and do things and I'm getting there now. 'For my children, it's nice for them to see their mum feeling better in themselves, then you can give more to your children.' She admitted that her swift rise to fame has been'surreal'. 'I still describe life as unreal,' she said. 'I still walk the same streets, I have the same friends and my children are at same schools but I am stopped all the time, it's surreal. It takes me ages to do a supermarket shop as I'm always stopped and chat to people.'"}

And the amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier. In the picture Kerber's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain in the resort town of Engelberg in central Switzerland to the bottom. Scroll down for video. The amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier. Kerber used two superheated emergency flares on the descent down the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain. The daredevil pictured at the moment he leaped into the darkness from the summit of Titlis. And just to show how dangerous jumping with the wingsuit was, Kerber made the flight during the day, showing how a wrong turn would easily have sent him crashing into one of the rocky crags that he was flying close to as he hurtled down from the mountain top. He said: 'I wanted to do a wingsuit BASE flight at night during winter for a very long time. But somehow I never really managed to do it.' The idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded. The first problem was that it was difficult to find a light that was bright enough to be seen from a distance of one mile away, where the camera needed to be placed. They solved it, though, by using two superheated emergency flares. These also provided some light to help illuminate the way, although the intense heat also posed a risk that they might set the suit on fire. Patrick said: 'We used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies. But flares burn very, very hot and my biggest fear was burning holes or melting the suit. That would have been super dangerous. To show how dangerous the jump was, Kerber did a trial run in daylight. A slight mistake would have sent Kerber crashing into craggy rocks. The wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video, with Kerber zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed. 'There definitely was a lot of pressure. Even though we did intense testing before, I did not know for sure how it would turn out. Having fire really close to you on a wingsuit BASE flight leaves no margin for error. Everything has to be worked out.' The two photographers, Fabian Wyss and Meier, stood on the other side of the valley on the Furrenalp to take the snap. Patrick also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute. He said: 'I definitely did not want to open up my parachute with fire still around me, as this could be very dangerous. I only have one single parachute attached to me. If this one burns or melts, it's over!' Kerber decided to use two torches. The first one he ignited before he took off and held in his right hand so it would be visible to the photographer. When the torch burned out, he opened up his parachute and when it was safely in the air, ignited a second torch attached to his foot. He said: 'I only had 20 seconds to ignite the second one as it also burned for one minute and I only had 1 minute and 15 seconds to the landing area.' Patrick Kerber has jumped at night before, but not in winter and only at full moon. He said: 'The feeling was very intense and amazing. It is much harder to orientate yourself, as you can't see as well. It feels much more intense because you fly with more feeling and awareness of your body and movements.'"}

There is a major split developing within the FA over chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s England Commission proposals to fund coaching development at the expense of cuts across the board. Dyke\u2019s initiative, with \u00a32.7million per year being switched from other parts of the FA budget to pay for 35 new coach educators to work in the grassroots (24) and professional game (11), has been approved by the FA board. But amateur blazers have yet to be convinced about the merits of such expenditure and the resulting 15 per cent cuts being imposed on every department to raise the cash. National game chairman Roger Burden has written to councillors to inform them of their colleagues\u2019 concern about the lack of consultation and their fears that the proposed reduction in FA Trophy and FA Vase prize-money may have a \u2018devastating effect\u2019 on some smaller clubs who rely on this money to stay afloat. An FA spokesman said the national game had four representatives on the FA board that has approved the proposal and it was up to individual departments where they made cuts. There are major splits developing within the FA over Greg Dyke's proposal to make cuts. England cricket chiefs Paul Downton and Peter Moores, having presided over abject preparation, performances and team selection at the World Cup, are fortunate the new ECB hierarchy had such low expectations. The high command are also busy with restructuring the organisation, so axeing the team leadership pair is not on their agenda. This probably means Downton and Moores will have this summer\u2019s Ashes series to secure their jobs."}

The confederation had been expected to give Blatter a unanimous vote of support. But the motion was never put to the 10 delegates, in the knowledge that it would not be fully backed. The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) Congress was held in Paraguay this week. There were signs that Sepp Blatter may not have the unanimous support of South America. CONMEBOL has long been a Blatter stronghold, but a number of the old guard have been replaced by football federation leaders, including President Juan Angel Napout, who won\u2019t necessarily back Blatter at all costs. The significance of the CONMEBOL snub to Blatter is that it was the first confederation gathering since three genuine challengers \u2014Prince Ali of Jordan, Belgium\u2019s Michael van Praag and Portugal\u2019s former world footballer of the year Luis Figo \u2014 declared their candidacy for the FIFA presidency.

The Budweiser contract will also give them exposure on the interview backboards for the quarter-finals at the weekend which were giving the impression that William Hill, the betting partner, were the main sponsor. The FA have a new \u00a31.5m-a-year official beer brand deal with Budweiser for the FA Cup until 2018. The England Cricket Board are now faced with a number of counties believing the Sky monopoly of cricket must end, with more of the game shown on terrestrial TV to help address falling participation. So, in their wisdom, the ECB have appointed Sky Sports greatest disciple Chris Haynes as their new director of communications \u2014 as Sports Agenda\u00a0predicted. During 24 years as a Sky spokesman, Haynes was seemingly programmed only to be super-positive about his employers. Cheltenham\u2019s former sponsorship chief Peter McNeile fell on his sword two years ago. It came after he told a reporter the Jockey Club, which own the course, were seeking a single, bluechip sponsor from outside the betting industry for three of its top races, including the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Yet all four of the marquee races at the Festival still have bookmaker names attached to them.

And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master. The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video. The Kardashian look: Australian women are embracing the contouring make up technique, which uses highlighting to'sculpt' facial features. Behind the blush: Kim Kardashian is a huge fan of contouring, and revealed to fans what goes into her high maintenance make up look in this Instagram picture. Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers. The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class. Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne. Eager to learn: Australian women are embracing the trend, and some have shelled out up to $3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top Hollywood make up artist. Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring. 'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get. 'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn\u2019t have the knowledge to do it themselves.' While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time. 'JLo \u2013 it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim\u2019s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.' Makeover: Lilit shares her contouring technique with Daily Mail Australia. Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones. 1. Start with applying your foundation as normal. 2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go. 3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend. 4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation. Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used. 5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are \u2018framing\u2019 the face. Blend the contouring \u2018in\u2019 (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards) 6. Finish the \u2018frame\u2019 by sweeping the colour under the jawline. 7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips. 8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid. 9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines. Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones. So, what is contouring exactly? 'It\u2019s not just drawing lines on your face. It\u2019s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don\u2019t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer \u2013 it\u2019s an illusion. You\u2019re sculpting your features.' 'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don\u2019t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.' Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 'A few years ago, when I\u2019d ask my clients what they want to do with their"}

Only just recovering from the impact of the Arab Spring uprisings four years ago, Tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers. But following Wednesday's attack and siege at the prestigious Bardo Museum in central Tunis, the country's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country. A significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack, which government officials said was the work of \"Islamists.\" Prime Minister Habib Essid said Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists are among those killed, with another 20 tourists plus two Tunisians wounded in the attack. MSC Cruises said its ship, MSC Splendida, is currently docked in the Tunis port of La Goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city, including the Bardo at the time of the attack. \"All the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended,\" MSC said in a statement. Another ship, the Costa Fascinosa, docked in Tunis at that time, has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers, its parent company Costa Cruise said. As details of the incident emerged, several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks, around an area that includes the national parliament building. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in Tunisia and the risk of kidnappings. Its warning cautions against trips to Tunisia's central, southern and border regions. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also urged UK citizens to stay away from the affected areas of Tunis and to \"follow the instructions of Tunisian security authorities.\" Its warning also carried longstanding advice: \"There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners.\" With tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in Tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there, travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack. It's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in Kenya last year. Thomson and First Choice, a UK-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to Tunisia, said it had canceled organized excursions to Tunis as a precaution. A statement said it would follow FCO advice, which overall remained unchanged for Tunisia. \"Thomson and First Choice customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today,\" it said. \"As a precaution however we have canceled excursions to Tunis for the coming days. \"Customer safety is of paramount importance to us and we continue to work closely with the FCO and the British Consulate to monitor the situation. Tunisia remains a popular destination for us and customers are enjoying their holidays as normal.\" In its advisory, the UK Foreign Office points out \"424,707 British nationals visited Tunisia in 2014. Most British tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free.\" Indeed, Tunisia's largely unsullied reputation as a safe north African destination for Europeans seeking low coast beach breaks has clawed back some of the popularity it enjoyed before 2011. In 2010, the country welcomed 6.9 million tourists to its beach resorts and numerous historic sites. In 2011, the year in which an uprising ousted longtime President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali -- an event credited with triggering the Arab Spring -- that number fell below 4.8 million. With calm restored in recent years -- despite security concerns from neighboring Libya and ongoing political tensions -- those numbers have been on the rise, helped by costly advertising campaigns. Recently reported statistics put visitor numbers still 10% lower than their pre-2011 levels, but numbers had been expected to rise again -- particularly with a new \"Star Wars\" film renewing interest in the country's role as a key location in the original movies. In a 2013 interview, Tunisian tourism minister Jamel Gamra said up to 20% of Tunisia's population -- equivalent to 2 million people -- relied on the tourism industry. He told the Inter Press Service he was optimistic that visitor numbers would continue to grow. \"The sector has big potential and we aim to reach 10 million tourists by 2016, a growth of one million tourists per year,\" he said. \"Tunisia also has more freedom and democracy now, which is very important for economic growth and prosperity and has a positive effect on the tourism industry.\""}

Last week Mr Cameron vowed to serve 'every day' of a second term if he is re-elected on May 7, right up to the next election at the end of the decade. But Mr Duncan Smith, himself a former leader, today insisted that Mr Cameron will have to stand before that to allow time for his successor to be chosen. Scroll down for video. Iain Duncan Smith,\u00a0himself a former leader, today insisted that Mr Cameron will have to stand before that to allow time for his successor to be chosen. Mr Cameron stunned the Tory party with his dramatic revelation that he would not seek a third term. The remarks triggered the start of an unofficial Tory leadership race, after he also tipped Boris Johnson, George Osborne and Theresa May as potential successors. The Tory leader joked: 'Terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many.' The admission, in an interview with the BBC, caused dismay in large parts of the Tory party because it distracted from the party's core election message on the economy, and over-shadowed last week's news that inflation had fallen to zero per cent. Mr Cameron defended his remarks, insisting he was 'just giving an honest answer to an honest question'. Challenged on the Sky News/Channel 4 election debate, he insisted: 'If you vote Conservative I've said I will serve every day of a full second term.' But at the very least he would need to stand aside several months before May 2020 to give his successor time to prepare for the general election. There has been speculation that Mr Cameron could quit after his promised 2017 referendum on leaving the EU, whatever the outcome. Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show the PM would choose the timing of his departure and he would be'sorry to see him go'. David Cameron has revealed he will not seek a third term if he wins the next election on May 7. Mr Cameron backed Boris Johnson, Theresa May and George Osborne as potential successors when he quits as Tory leader. Asked if Mr Cameron has to'stand down at some point during the next Parliament' in order to allow a successor to be in place for the election, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'He does. But I have huge faith in the Prime Minister. I think, given the nature of the terrible circumstances we inherited, under his leadership he's turned the economy around and taken some tough decisions. 'He will do what he says, which is he will serve what essentially is a full term. Of course, there will be a competition at some point, but I have to tell you that will be a competition on the back of a successful Prime Minister doing something that most prime ministers have never done before - saying 'I know when it's time to go'. 'You've had to literally rap the knuckles of people like Gordon Brown and previous prime ministers to get them to think of going. He is actually very keen to say 'There is a limit. There's an amount of time a prime minister should serve before they get stale.' And he is right about that.' In the BBC interview when the Tory leader announced his plans to stand down, Samantha Cameron made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the right man to lead the country. Mr Duncan Smith was Tory leader from 2001 to 2003, when he was forced out in a vote of no confidence. He said it was 'a different world' then, as the prime minister was at that point able to select the date of the election and it was'very difficult to say what a full term was'. The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act had allowed prime ministers to plan ahead with certainty about how long their term might be, he said. Mr Duncan Smith refused to be drawn on the identity of possible successors, but suggested that it would be someone who is already in the public eye. 'I don't think that you're going to have in any shape or form a brand-new leader that the country has never seen, because all the people that might want to stand for that will have been up in the public sphere for some time,' he said. 'I'm not going to name names. I know that those who want to throw their hat in the ring will throw it very hard and those that don't will think about it.'"}

Rebecca Mead, 25, says she never leaves the house without wearing foundation, powder, blusher, mascara, lipstick, eyeshadow and eyeliner - which takes her an hour every morning to apply. In her lifetime, Becca, who lives in Hadley, Suffolk, claims she has spent more than 5,000 hours applying makeup to her face - and is now going cold turkey  \u2013 to prove women do not need 'a mask' and to raise money for Special Effects, which helps disabled people. ecca with her new bare-faced look as she vows to go a year without wearing any makeup. Becca, pictured left as a brunette and, right, as a blonde, estimates she spends 5,000 hours a year applying makeup - but has vowed to quit to raise money for charity. Becca, who will also stop dyeing her hair every month and wearing fake nails, said:\u00a0'Considering I have worn a full face of makeup everyday for 16 years and refused to leave the house without a full layer of foundation it's quite scary.' So far, the beauty obsessive, who spends hundreds of pounds a year on beauty products, says people's reactions have been mixed. 'Some people have said nothing but other people said I looked tired, which isn't great,' she said. The supermarket worker started applying hair dye at 12 and wearing makeup at 14, spending hours before school carefully applying cosmetics to her face. Becca (pictured left and right with makeup) never left the house without makeup before taking on the challenge. Becca (pictured with makeup) spent at least an hour each morning layering on foundation, powder, blusher, mascara, lipstick, eyeshadow and eyeliner. She would spend at least an hour each morning layering on foundation, powder, blusher, mascara, lipstick, eyeshadow and eyeliner and even put on false eyelashes. 'I'd get up at least an hour earlier each morning so I looked my best,' Miss Mead admitted. 'I had special tricks like applying extra powder to my eyebrows to make them look thicker. 'I would carefully apply nail varnish and had boxes of cosmetics which I ordered off the internet. 'I spent a lot of money on makeup and loved it.' But Becca is now out to prove a point: 'I think women have become too reliant on makeup and I want to prove they don't need to be. Becca, pictures with makeup,  revealed that she will be going fresh-faced for a year to to raise money for a charity called Special Effects which helps disabled people. Becca admitted hair dye was one of her biggest problems, and she changes her colour every month. 'There was a time when I would change my hair colour every month \u2013 now I realise that was not necessary. 'I can't believe I used to be too scared to leave the house without makeup. I wouldn't even pop to the shops without applying slap which seems ridiculous.' 'I don't know what my natural hair colour is,' she admitted. 'Possibly brown. When it came to make up, Becca admits she used to would wear 'the whole shebang'. 'I even put power on my eyebrows to thicken them,' she said. 'This was to give them more shape. Becca also admitted hair dye was one of her biggest problems. 'I probably changed my hair colour every month,' she said. 'I became addicted - most colour I used was quite unnatural.' Becca who decided to quit her addiction earlier this month said she\u00a0received\u00a0great encouragement from\u00a0friends. 'I asked a few of my friends what they thought and decided to go for it.

The Oconee County Sheriff's Office is still investigating the case, and speculation of hazing has been rampant.", "article": "The parents of a 19-year-old Clemson University student who died last year after falling from a highway bridge during a pre-dawn fraternity run sued the university, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and three of its members for $50 million on Monday. Tucker Hipps' body was found by police last September beneath a highway bridge over a lake near the Clemson, South Carolina campus when he didn't return from the run with other fraternity pledges. The two civil suits, which seek $25 million each, allege that Hipps died as a result of a confrontation with a fraternity member over breakfast food he was told to bring that morning. Lawsuitl: Cynthia and Gary Hipps filed two $25M suits in South Carolina Monday, one against their son's fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon and three members and one against the school he attended when he died after falling off a highway bridge during a pre-dawn run with his fraternity brothers. Tragic: The two civil suits allege that Hipps died as a result of a confrontation with a fraternity member over breakfast food he was told to bring that morning. Hipps sent a text message that he didn't have enough money for the order of '30 McDonald's biscuits, 30 McDonald's hash browns and two gallons of chocolate milk,' but a fraternity brother confronted him on the bridge over the order, court records show. Hipps then went over the railing of the bridge into shallow water in Lake Hartwell head first, the lawsuits said, adding that a fraternity member shone a flashlight into the dark water below but took no further action to locate the student. Clemson University, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and the fraternity members could not be immediately reached for comment. It was not clear whether the defendants had retained attorneys. A spokeswoman for the university told the Greenville News that the school was aware of the legal action, but would not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit suggests Hipp was pressured to jump off this bridge bridge into shallow waters of Lake Hartwell\u00a0after he failed to follow a senior frat brother's orders. The son of U.S. Rep. John Carney, D-Del., is one of five defendants in two lawsuits seeking at least $50 million stemming from the death of a Clemson University fraternity pledge. In addition to Samuel Quillen Carney, the lawsuits name two other fraternity members, as well as the university and the fraternity. Defendant:\u00a0Samuel Quillen Carney, the son of\u00a0U.S. Rep. John Carney, D-Del., was named in the suit. 'No one - certainly no parent - can feel anything but sympathy for this family's grief and anger,' John Carney and his wife, Tracey Quillen Carney, said in a statement released by his office on Tuesday. 'We have faith that those trusted with investigative and legal authority will act based on facts.' 'Our advice to Sam since the tragedy in September has been to tell the truth and remember that any detail might help,' the statement said. 'That continues to be our message to him. The lawsuits, one brought by Hipps' estate and a wrongful death suit brought by his parents, say fraternity brothers ordered Hipps to bring biscuits, hash browns and 2 gallons of chocolate milk to the fraternity before the run but he said he didn't have enough money. One of the fraternity brothers confronted Hipps about not bringing the food, the suit said, later adding, 'Tucker went over the railing of the bridge into shallow waters of Lake Hartwell head first.' In addition to the $25 million in actual damages, the lawsuits seek unspecified punitive damages and ask for a jury trial. The other two fraternity members named as defendants are Thomas Carter King and Campbell T. Starr. Neither they nor Samuel Carney immediately responded to messages left in their campus email accounts seeking comment. Source: AP. Forced? The suits said the fraternity had a long tradition of'requiring, pressuring, encouraging and forcing' pledge members to jump off bridges over the lake and swim to shore. Hazing? Hipps sent a text message that he didn't have enough money for the order of '30 McDonald's biscuits, 30 McDonald's hash browns and two gallons of chocolate milk,' but a fraternity brother confronted him on the bridge over the order, court records show. The suits said the fraternity had a long tradition of'requiring, pressuring, encouraging and forcing' pledge members to jump off bridges over the lake and swim to shore. Hipps was not under the influence of any substances, according to a toxicology report. He died of blunt force trauma from a head-first fall onto rocks in shallow water, a coroner's report showed. The lawsuits contend his death was caused by the gross negligence and recklessness of the defendants, including two other fraternity members who had organized the run. Hipps' death sparked rampant speculation at the time by students on social media that hazing was involved, but police said a preliminary investigation did not indicate a role for hazing. The Oconee County Sheriff's Office said this month its case remained open."}

Steven Simoff works at the Lakeside Casino in Osceola, Iowa, but lives in Davis City, more than six hours on foot down the bleak Interstate Highway 35. In order to get to work for his 11pm shift he leaves his home at 3.30pm and walks alongside four lanes of thundering traffic in sun, rain, wind or snow. Scroll down for video. Feet of endurance: Steven Simoff works as an overnight janitor at Lakeside Casino in Osceola, Iowa, but lives in Davis City, Iowa - 35 miles away. To get to work for his 11pm shift he leaves his home at 3.30pm. Devoted husband: Steven Simoff kisses his wife, Renee, goodbye. 'You've got to keep your job', he said. Simoff lives with his wife, Renee, who receives Supplemental Security Income and their 22-year-old grandson, Steven, who is currently unemployed. Money has been tight since Renee suffered a stroke nine years ago. She has also had a couple of heart attacks. Earning $9.07 an hour in his casino job, Simoff says his family can't afford to live closer to work  because their rent in Davis City is just $400 per month. Simoff owns a 2002 Ford Windstar minivan, but says he can rarely afford to buy gas for it. 'First of all, when you got a family, and you've got a job, you've got to be able to support your family. And you've got to keep your job \u2014 the most two important things I can think of,' he told the Des Moines Register. Simoff's daily trek beats that undertaken by James Robertson, 56, from Detroit who received a $350,000 from a GoFundMe campaign and a new Ford Taurus after his plight received national media attention. Although Simoff's journey is longer, he told the Register that he can typically catch a lift three out of five days. He works Thursday-to-Tuesday and says that Sundays are typically the worst for trying to catch a lift. His frugal approach has its drawbacks, however - he has to buy a new pair of shoes every two months. Different generations: Steven Simoff with his grandson Steven (left). Money has been tight since his wife Renee (right) suffered a stroke nine years ago. She has also had a couple of heart attacks. Going the distance: The extent of Simoff's commute is made clear compared to the scale of Iowa. On average Simoff spends nearly four hours a day walking to work. 'It all depends on weather and what people feel like that day, if they're going to stop and pick you up,' he said. On his way home, Simoff is able to hitch a ride most of the way home with a co-worker who lives in Leon, leaving him eight miles to walk. 'He's trying to earn a living,' said Emil Segebart, who has been giving rides to Simoff for a decade. 'That's how I look at it. You're trying to earn a living and doing what it takes. And this is what it takes.' Once in work Simoff has to spend his eight-hour shift on his feet cleaning the casino, except for two 15-minute breaks and a half hour for a meal. Despite his advancing years he says he's never been injured while walking to work and the only medication he takes is the occasional aspirin or Tylenol. 'If I don't get to work,' he said, 'bills don't get paid. As long as my two feet are good and my health is good, I don't think I'll change.' Hard work: Once at the Lakeside Casino Simoff spends his eight-hour shift on his feet cleaning overnight.

McCall has stated that the decision to send the players back to Newcastle is up to the club's hierarchy.", "article": "Stuart McCall has confirmed Rangers are paying money for all five Newcastle United loanees - despite two of them being highly unlikely to ever appear for the Ibrox club. McCall has inherited a bizarre situation created by the extraordinary mass deal chief executive Derek Llambias brokered on transfer deadline day early last month. Llambias \u2013 a former managing director at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 has since been ousted as a PLC director and suspended from the football board at Ibrox following the takeover by Dave King and his allies. Sturat McCall has revealed that Rangers are paying some of the wages for the five players signed on loan from Newcastle in the January window even though only one of them is available at the moment. Of the five players loaned from Newcastle, only Haris Vuckic will again be available for Sunday's crunch Championship encounter with Hibernian after recovering from a calf knock. The only further first-team involvement has come from centre-back Remie Streete, who managed 44 minutes against Raith Rovers last month before succumbing to a hamstring injury. Youngster Kevin Mbabu, who has never played a senior game, is involved with Rangers\u2019 Under-20 squad, but McCall revealed midfielder Gael Bigirimana has been ruled out for the season by an unspecified \u2018medical condition\u2019. The new Ibrox boss is also highly sceptical about ever having Northern Ireland international Shane Ferguson available, as he recovers from a knee injury on Tyneside. Asked if the quintet were on Rangers wage bill, McCall replied: \u2018Yes. The club is paying for them.\u2019 It\u2019s understood the Ibrox outfit only make a contribution to their Newcastle wages, rather than paying the entire salary they earn at Mike Ashley\u2019s club. McCall prepares the Rangers players for Sunday's clash with Hibernian. Even so, the fact so little value has been earned will outrage Rangers fans. \u2018Young Biggi (Bigirimana) has a medical condition that our consultant is dealing with,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018But he won\u2019t play for us this season. \u2018Kevin Mbabu is training and he has played two under-20 games, but his match fitness is not up to what we would like at the moment. But he\u2019s working hard, the kid. \u2018Shane Ferguson has had a long-standing serious knee injury, I think he\u2019s been out for four or five months. He had a minor setback a couple of weeks ago, so he won\u2019t be up with us for another couple of weeks. \u2018By then he will have been out for five or six months so he\u2019ll likely need another six weeks to get him anywhere near being available. \u2018So even though he might come up and train with us, depending on what level we can get him to, he looks a serious doubt to be involved. McCall faces the media on Friday ahead of the crucial clash with second place Hibs. \u2018Remie Streete came and played the first game and pulled his hamstring, was out for a couple of weeks then came back and pulled his thigh. And he\u2019s had an ear infection on top of that. \u2018He\u2019s two or three weeks again, working with the medical side of it. But again I don\u2019t think Remie has played lots of football over the past two years. So we didn\u2019t have guys coming in who were hitting the ground running, being ready to play.\u2019 McCall said enquiries about Bigirimana\u2019s condition would have to be directed to the medical staff. However, when pressed if it was something the 21-year-old had contracted since moving to Glasgow, he replied: \u2018No. It\u2019s a long-standing thing.\u2019 The current state of play begs the question as to whether Rangers can simply send those not available back to Newcastle. \u2018I think that\u2019s not for me, that\u2019s for the hierarchy to sort out,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018Certainly two of them - Biggi and Shane Ferguson - would be very doubtful, unless Shane recovers very quickly from his long-term knee operation. \u2018For Kevin and Remie, it\u2019s just about getting some football in them. If they are ready to go then we will consider them.\u2019"}

He announced \u00a37million a year of new money to fund guards for all Jewish private schools and colleges across the country. Terror attacks: Mr Cameron said 'incitement' on the internet and by radical preachers involved the peddling of the idea 'that 9/11 (left) was a Jewish plot or that the 7/7 London attacks (right) were staged' He added that MPs from all parties had highlighted the threat to synagogues and community buildings, which would get \u00a33million. \u2018That\u2019s over \u00a310million of new money for security \u2013 this year and every year \u2013 for as long as necessary\u2019, Mr Cameron said. There will also be a one-off \u00a31.5million payment to the Trust to fund state of the art CCTV cameras. Mr Cameron said the Jewish community feels \u2018safe to live and flourish\u2019 in Britain, at a time when thousands of Jews are fleeing France every year to live in Israel. He added: \u2018For as long as I am Prime Minister, you will never be alone. When people talk of trying to boycott Israel, you will never be alone.

Now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads. The latest infographic uses data from the 'Nuclear Notebook', which since 1987 has tracked the number and type of the world's nuclear arsenals. 'I don't think people truly understand just how many of these weapons there are in the world,' said Rachel Bronson, executive director of the Bulletin, who publishes the notebook. 'The interactive is a way to see, immediately, who has nuclear weapons and when they got them, and how those numbers relate to each other. 'It is a startling experience, looking at those comparisons.'\u00a0Russia and the US have most nuclear weapons, followed by the UK and France, according to the graphic. It creators, Hans Kristensen and Robert Norris, from the Federation of American Scientists say that in the past, host countries have learned of foreign nuclear weapons on their soil from the Nuclear Notebook. The left image shows a pock-marked landscape which is the the result of decades of nuclear weapons testing in the Nevada desert.\u00a0There are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world \u2013 enough to kill everyone in on the planet 100 times over. Pictured on the right is a mushroom cloud rising above the Nevada desert in 1953. 'For instance, Japan - which was the target of two atomic bomb attacks and has a law against nuclear weapons on its territory - learned from the Notebook that there were US nuclear weapons on Chichi Jima and Iwo Jima,' the authors write. '[It also learned] about an enormous and varied US nuclear arsenal on Okinawa, US nuclear bombs stored on the mainland at Misawa and Itazuki air bases, and nuclear-armed US Navy ships stationed in Sasebo and Yokosuka.' Data for the US on the interactive map has been compiled using declassified documents from the US government, many of which were obtained using Freedom of Information requests. They combined this with figures from congressional hearings, specialty magazines, and confidential sources. 'Creating estimates for other nuclear-armed states can be more challenging because not all provide as much information as the United States,' the authors write. For instance, Britain and France have published some information about their arsenals, but much is still unavailable. A self-propelled suface to air missile during a drill shown in a North Korean drill. North Korea appears poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020, US researchers warned last week. And cutting-edge European companies could be unwittingly contributing to Pyongyang's suspect nuclear program with their equipment diverted to the isolated country via China, they said. Unveiling the first results of what will be a 15-month study, Joel Wit, senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said some of their conclusions were very 'disturbing.' Using satellite imagery, North Korean media reports and their deep knowledge of nuclear programs, Wit, and veteran nuclear non-proliferation expert David Albright, have drawn up three possible scenarios based on the progress that Pyongyang from 2009 to 2014. In the first scenario, Pyongyang would almost double its stockpile to about 20 weapons, including plutonium-based weapons which have been miniaturized sufficiently to be mounted on its Rodong-class medium-range ballistic missile, capable of reaching Japan. In the second - and most likely scenario - North Korea continues its current trajectory and manages to produce 50 weapons by 2020.\u00a0It would also make significant advances in miniaturisation technology enabling it to mount warheads on intermediate-range ballistic missiles. In what Wit dubbed 'the worst case scenario,' the North Korean stockpile would grow more rapidly to 100 weapons and make'significant advances' in weapons designs to enable it to potentially deploy battlefield and tactical weapons. For Russia and the remaining nuclear-armed, estimates rely on information from Western intelligence organisations, expert studies, news media reports, and satellite imagery. Since the U.S unleashed the first nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki back in 1945 there have been a staggering 2056 nuclear tests recorded worldwide. It took almost a year until the next substantial tests took place but by the mid-50s and 60s, nuclear experiments were being recorded across the globe on almost a monthly basis.

Nicknamed the 'home of golf', St Andrews in Scotland has now earned a a new claim to fame as the most costly spot to spend a night in Britain in 2014. Visitors wanting to experience the historic town, which boasts the third oldest university in the UK as well as hosting the Ryder Cup, can expect to cough up \u00a3158 per room per night. St Andrews in Scotland has now earned a a new claim to fame as the most costly spot to spend a night in Britain in 2014.\u00a0Visitors wanting to experience the historic town, which boasts the third oldest university in the UK\u00a0can expect to cough up \u00a3158 per room per night. Hotel rooms were more than \u00a320 cheaper in London than St Andrews with the average costing \u00a3136. This is a five per cent rise from last year where hotel rooms cost \u00a3148, according to the latest Hotels.com Hotel Price Index. It was above London, at \u00a3136, Oxford at \u00a3127, Bath at \u00a3120 and Windsor at \u00a3118. Only one place in the top 10 the channel island of Jersey, had hotel rooms averaging under \u00a3100 a night. It was also the only place in the top 10 to see a decline in hotel prices, dropping 4 per cent on 2013 to \u00a397 per night. The beautiful hilly vistas and historic sights of Bristol proved popular with tourists as the city recorded the greatest increase in hotel prices - a rise of 13 per cent to \u00a387 per night. Growing consumer confidence triggered by the boost in the UK economy of 2.6 per cent in 2014 meant more people were happy to spend on hotel rooms. Coupled with increased foreign tourism, this increase meant average hotel prices paid by all travellers in the UK went up by 2 per cent to \u00a3104. Matt Walls, vice president of Hotels.com, said: 'The UK clearly displayed the ability to attract a record number of visitors in 2014. In spite of the increase in the national average room rate, overall prices paid by consumers are still great value, a clear indication that the tourism industry here is in good shape.' North of England seaside destinations like Scarborough provide the best value, with rooms averaging \u00a361. The beautiful hilly vistas and historic sights of Bristol proved popular with tourists as the city recorded the greatest increase in hotel prices - a rise of 13 per cent to \u00a387 per night. Sporting events also contributed to boosting a city's fortunes with the Commonwealth Games contributing to a 12 per cent increase in Glasgow to \u00a387, while the Tour de France triggered an 8 per cent rise in Leeds to \u00a379. Holidaymakers wanting to escape home without shelling out \u00a3100 a night are advised to stick to the North of England. Bradford, the curry capital of Britain, was the best value for money place to stay, with rooms reaching an average of \u00a351 a night. Seaside destinations like Scarborough and Blackpool also proved affordable options, with the average price of hotels at \u00a361 per night. Increases were spread across the country as all but five of the 46 destinations included in the report saw\u00a0their figures rise. But prices dipped in several holiday favourites with the Cotswolds down 8 per cent to \u00a387 and the Lake District slipping 2 per cent to \u00a386. Canterbury slipping and Sheffield both slipped down by 1 per cent to \u00a384 and \u00a365 respectively. Across the world, the boost in the global economy seen in 2014 was mirrored by a \u00a0three per cent rise in the average hotel prices as  consumers became more confident in raising their travel spending. Hotel prices have now experienced five years of steady price rises since they plummeted during the financial collapse of 2008/9. Glasgow saw a boost from the Commonweath Games, with hotel prices increasing by 12 per cent  to \u00a387. Johan Svanstrom, President of the Hotels.com brand, said: 'Although the Index rose again last year, it is still way behind its peak of seven years ago which is great news for consumers. 'Each year is unique in the travel industry and 2014 was no exception, bringing its own opportunities and challenges. Global events, such as the Winter Olympic Games and World Cup, predictably attracted travellers to new destinations.

But the National Trust now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits \u2013 because they are too demanding on visitors. The charity, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens, is worried that rooms often have \u2018so much stuff\u2019 it puts off all but the middle classes. The National Trust, which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, is worried that exhibitions often have \u2018so much stuff\u2019 it puts off all but the middle classes. In an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of Britain\u2019s grand properties, bosses yesterday launched a ten-year strategy that includes plans to \u2018simplify\u2019 some exhibits. Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary. \u2018We are making visitors work too hard in some places,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s not surprising given that where we have come from, that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable, that it forms more of their cultural background. \u2018Our analysis is that it isn\u2019t the entrance fee that is putting people off, it is that they think this isn\u2019t \u201cthe place for them\u201d So how do we get them in?\u2019 The Trust's director general\u00a0Dame Helen Ghosh, said places like the\u00a0Carrick-a-Rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes. Dame Helen, who was Permanent Secretary of the Home Office until she was appointed to the Trust in 2012, said that some properties have a broader appeal. \u2018When you go to somewhere like Carrick-a-Rede in Northern Ireland and watch people walking over the rope bridge, they are from every socio-economic background, wearing shorts, flip flops, all of that,\u2019 she said. But many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base. The Trust is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties. Dame Helen said: \u2018When it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits. There is so much stuff in there. \u2018Let\u2019s not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let\u2019 s pick one lovely thing, put it in the middle of the room and light it really well. \u2018Let\u2019s just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it\u2019s not difficult. \u2018We make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard.\u2019 But she denied that the Trust is \u2018dumbing down\u2019 its approach in order to boost visitor numbers. \u2018In many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding,\u2019 Dame Helen insisted. \u2018People will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail, than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression.\u2019 Tim Parker, chairman of the Trust, added: \u2018Every museum and gallery has the middle class problem. \u2018We have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive.\u2019 The National Trust is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder Octavia Hill, who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor. As part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in Sheffield, Manchester and Coventry, to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks. The Trust hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces. Although the Trust is not putting in any money to the schemes, other charities such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and Nesta are also involved. Mr Parker, a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist Sir Simon Jenkins, said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the Trust\u2019s appeal. \u2018The fantastic opportunity for the Trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people don\u2019t have to go inside,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well. It is an age thing, not just a class thing.\u2019"}

{"abstract": "Indiana is set to declare a public health emergency due to an alarming increase in HIV infections, which have been linked to intravenous drug use in southern Indiana. Governor Mike Pence is considering a needle exchange program as a way to curb the spread of the virus, and the state is running an awareness campaign to warn residents about the outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in the area to help with the outbreak, and a bill is up for debate in the legislature that would allow needle exchanges under a temporary provision.", "article": "Indiana is set to declare a public health emergency to county an alarming increase in the rate of HIV infections. Governor Mike Pence said Wednesday he's mulling a needle exchange and other programs aimed at curbing the rise in infection rates that has been tied to intravenous drug use in southern Indiana. HIV cases have ballooned in the state recently, with 72 cases confirmed and 7 others that preliminary tests say are positive, all coming out of Scott County. Scroll down for video. Drastic measures: Governor Mike Pence said Wednesday he's mulling a needle exchange and other programs aimed at curbing the rise in infection rates that has been tied to intravenous drug use in southern Indiana. Pence says he will be issuing an executive order Thursday morning to tackle the growing issue, and says although he opposes needle exchanges, that option is on the table. A CDC report in 2005 on syringe exchange programs found those types of interventions were cost-effective ways of preventing blood-borne infections like HIV. 'The cost [of preventing one] HIV infection by SEPs has been calculated at $4,000 to $12,000, considerably less than the estimated $190,000 medical costs of treating a person infected with HIV,' the report stated, with dollars calculated in their 1997 values. Needle-exchange programs allow intravenous drug users to bring in used needles in exchange for clean syringes, which is believed to suppress transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. Those exchanges are barred by the state of Indiana, though a bill up for debate in the legislature would allow them under a temporary provision. Dr William Cooke, who runs a clinic in Austin, says his town has borne the brunt of growing intravenous drug use, seeing Hepatitis-C cases be replaced by bigger issues. Mulling it over: Governor Scott Pence appeared in Scottsburg, the county seat, to meet with local officials Wednesday about the crisis, and plans to institute new policies to combat a public health emergency. State response: Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr Jerome Adams said that an awareness campaign has been launched, along with mobile teams sent into the area. 'We've seen an increase in overdoses,' Cooke told NBC. 'We've identified that most of our IV drug users are Hepatitis-C positive. We knew it was a only matter of time until HIV set in.' 'We need help. But that costs money. My clinic serves the poorest people in Indiana, potentially the poorest in the country,' Cooke said. 'We do a sliding scale here. If they can, they may pay us 10 dollars for care. I'm hopeful this declaration provides the funding we have needed.' 'It's overwhelming how much pain and suffering is going on here. We can provide a basic level of primary care. But some people can't even afford 10 dollars.' Pence appeared in Scottsburg, the county seat, to meet with local officials Wednesday about the crisis. 'This is a public health emergency and I'm listening to my health department, I'm listening to the Centers for Disease Control,' Pence said after the meeting. 'I'll make my decision based on the best science and the best way we can stop this virus and stop this outbreak in its tracks,' he added. In the last month, Indiana has gone from 26 confirmed HIV cases, when officials first announced the outbreak, to 72 now. Intravenous drug led to infection in almost all cases, according to state epidemiologist Pam Pontones. Still, the number of HIV cases is estimated to rise in the coming weeks. Indiana officials know of up to 100 people that may be connected to those with confirmed cases and are trying to contact them. Indiana is running an awareness campaign through billboards and social media aimed at warning residents about the outbreak exploding in south Indiana. Dr Jerome Adams, the state health commissioner, said a mobile health unit is being sent with= resources that the state hopes will aid in the outbreak. Pontones said staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who arrived in the area Monday, agreed with state officials that the outbreak 'is an indicator of a larger problem' of drug use driven by poverty. 'With the amount of drug use that's happening and the intravenous needle-sharing that's going on, if someone who's highly infectious becomes part of that sharing network, that infection can transmit very rapidly,' Pontones said. She said the vast majority of the people who've become infected during the outbreak shared a syringe with someone else while injecting a liquid form of the prescription painkiller Opana. Republican Representative Ed Clere of New Albany, who proposed the needle distribution and collection program Wednesday at the Statehouse, said a House panel considered similar legislation last year, but it didn't receive a hearing in the Senate. 'Unfortunately we're back here, not just with needle exchange as a hypothetical theory, but with a real situation where a needle exchange (program) could make a difference,' he said."}

With no previous writing experience, Rachel knew the former would be tricky \u2013 but what she hadn\u2019t counted on was how difficult it would be to crack the latter. Despite viewing countless properties in Tuscany, she and husband John were left disappointed until they discovered a ruined 15th Century monastery in neighbouring Le Marche. Instantly smitten, they swapped their home in the Pennines for one in the Apennines. Dream home: Rachel Abbott and her husband viewed countless properties in Tuscany before discovering the monastery in neighbouring Le Marche. Resurrected: The couple paid just \u00a3150,000 for the monastery in 2000. Pictured: the ruins of the monastery. \u2018When we went to Italy we knew what we wanted \u2013 an ancient building that had been completely modernised,\u2019 says Rachel, 62. \u2018There were lots that fitted the bill but something about them didn\u2019t click \u2013 they weren\u2019t right. \u2018Then, finally, an estate agent took us to this place and we just knew\u2026\u2019 All that remained of the monastery was the chapel \u2013 minus the roof \u2013 and the oratory. Yet the couple were mesmerised by the building and its location. \u2018It had views to the Adriatic in one direction and the mountains in the other,\u2019 says Rachel. \u2018We got such a sense of peace and tranquillity.\u2019 The region also excited them.

Luckily, the old building had survived until the 1960s, so they were able to find photographs, enabling their architects to recreate the style of original. They covered two layers of stone used for the walls in terracotta tiling, just as would have been done in the 15th Century, and windows were installed exactly where they were in the pictures. Behind the facade, the couple built a modern eight-bedroom home with seven en suites, a swimming pool and, for John\u2019s benefit, a five-hole golf course in the five acres of grounds.

She had been toying with an idea for a psychological crime thriller for some time, and by 2010 she had finished her first work, Only The Innocent. Then, however, she was faced with another problem: how to find a publisher. Rachel did not fancy the anguish of rejection, so her solution was to self-publish on Amazon instead. At first her novels sold at the rate of only six a week. \u2018Then I thought, \u201cThis is crazy. I know about marketing, I\u2019m going to make this book sell.\u201d \u2018I set up a Twitter account, which now has 12,500 followers, and emailed every blogger and reviewer I could find. I spent countless hours on forums and Facebook. As a result I changed my life.\u2019 Rachel\u2019s subsequent success has been astounding. A first novel is thought to have done well if it sells 3,000 copies \u2013 Only The Innocent and follow-up books The Back Road and Sleep Tight have together sold a million.

She was barely alive, but is now doing better and watching Dora and singing with her grandpa. It is believed that the car seat and the baby's baby fat helped her survive the 14 hours in the cold water, and the rescuers heard a mysterious voice calling for help.", "article": "(CNN)Lily wasn't moving when rescuers found her, hanging upside down in her mother's smashed car. It had flipped over into a frigid Utah river half a day before, and the baby was still strapped in her seat. As Officer Jared Warner dashed with the 18-month-old in his arms to an ambulance, she was barely alive. But she's doing better, her family said Monday. \"Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching 'Dora (the Explorer)' and singing '(The) Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa. She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers,\" they said. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25 years old. Lily might have died unseen with her mother, had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. \"Where the car was, you couldn't see it from the roadway,\" police Lt. Cory Slaymaker said. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. Police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water. The rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for Officer Bryan DeWitt. \"I don't remember doing anything but just doing it,\" he said. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Then they noticed the baby. \"She was definitely unconscious and not responsive,\" Warner said. But she was still alive, and rescuers were delighted to see it. She was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred when police believe it did. The night before, a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check, but he saw nothing unusual, police said, and dismissed it. That was at about 10:30 p.m. on Friday. Groesbeck's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment. \"The driver's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge, launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water,\" Slaymaker told CNN affiliate KUTV. The angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, 14 hours later. Groesbeck's death is tragic, but the survival of baby Lily is a story filled with hope. But just how did the baby survive the ordeal? Above all, said CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, the biggest factor was the car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached, Cohen said. Even though the child was trapped and upside down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures, Cohen said. Another factor may have been that the girl, as a toddler, has baby fat. If she had been an infant, it might have been a different story, Cohen said. It's a reminder that the human body is tough. Lily apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold, without food or drink. A mystery arose from the rescue: The police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help. The mother was dead, but the officers said that they heard an adult's voice calling to them. \"The four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car,\" Warner told CNN. \"To me, it didn't sound like a child's voice.\" The voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright, he said. The mother was dead. The child was unconscious, but her eyelids were fluttering, and the rescuers knew she was alive, Warner said. It's one of those things that doesn't have an explanation, he said about the voice. \"It felt like I could hear someone telling me, 'I need help,'\" DeWitt told CNN affiliate KSL. \"It was very surreal, something that I felt like I could hear.\" Tyler Beddoes, a third officer at the scene, said the same. \"All I know is that it was there, we all heard it, and that just helped us to push us harder, like I say, and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" The river is 10 feet deep in some places, police said, but the car hit a shallower spot. Images showed it only partly covered by water. Lily was not submerged, said Police Lt. Matt Johnson. Firefighter Paul Tomadakis freed her from the wreck"}

Italy is to outline proposals to fast-track African migrants and send them directly to EU countries including Britain. Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in Africa, at meetings with his EU counterparts in Brussels tomorrow. Mr Alfano claims that the migrant crisis should be tackled with refugee camps on African soil, where asylum seekers could be identified and then distributed evenly throughout European states. The minister\u2019s proposals come as the EU border chief warned that there are up to a million migrants in Libya preparing to cross the Mediterranean. Italy, with its southernmost landfall just a 80km (49 miles) from Africa, is the first port of call for many seeking new lives in Europe. With Libya descending into ever-worsening chaos and lawlessness, almost 9,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores in January and February, up 43 per cent on last year\u2019s record figures. Fabrice Leggeri director of EU border control Frontex said: \u2018Our sources tell us there are anywhere between 500,000 to a million people ready to leave from Libya.\u2019 \u2018We have to be ready to address a more difficult situation than last year.\u2019 With militias loyal to the Islamic State making frightening inroads in Libya, it is feared that jihadis could enter Europe by boat hidden among migrants. Minister Alfano, of the centre-right NCD party, said the solution has to be found in Africa: \u2018We must resolve the problem at its origin.\u00a0There are two paths, stabilise Libya and create refugee camps in. Africa so that the screening is done there, and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the European countries.\u2019 He told Italian television La 7 in advance of the meeting that Libya has become \u2018an international priority.\u2019 \u2018The camps would do a preventative screening,\u2019 he said. \u2018Who has refugee status would be distributed in a balanced way among various European countries, those who aren\u2019t would not be given permission to leave.\u2019 Italy is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in Europe. These migrants were rescued from the sea after the boat they were travelling in capsised. Three of the camps would be based in Niger, Tunisia and Sudan, according to Italian media reports. Natasha Bertaud, spokesman for the EU executive, said the plans were in an \u2018orientation phase\u2019. She said the Commission was \u2018aware that some member states are in discussions to develop centres in North. Africa and are in contact with the International Organisation for Migration and UNHCR about the possibility of developing centres for migrants to facilitate screening and logistics for the voluntary return of economic migrants, as well as identifying those who need help.\u2019 A pilot project in Niger is under discussion, she said. Deploying liaison officers in third party countries is \u2018a long term project\u2019 she said. It is thought up to a million people might be willing to make the crossing from Libya. Pictured: A group of migrants arrived in Lampedusa few days ago, arrive in the harbour of Lampedusa to be transferred to Sicily. The proposals are likely to meet opposition in norther European states that may bear the brunt of a future quota system. But the plans were welcomed in Italy.

A close family friend of Logan's, financial pundit Ed Butowsky,confirmed to\u00a0Breitbart\u00a0that the 43-year-old had been\u00a0hospitalized and revealed the extent of the journalism heavy hitter's suffering since the attack in Cairo's Tahrir Square. 'In spite of everything she\u2019s had to face in the last two years, people have no idea the physical suffering she has been enduring due to the brutal sexual assault she encountered,' Mr Butowsky said. Scroll down for video. CBS News correspondent Lara Logan pictured shortly before she was sexually assaulted in Tahrir Square while she was reporting on the Egyptian protests in February 2011. She was admitted to hospital this week for the fourth time this year amid ongoing complications from the attack. Mr Butowsky told Breitbart that Logan had been in and out of the hospital since the attack, which occurred while Logan was reporting on the Arab Spring. On February 11, 2011, Logan was the victim of a'sustained and brutal' sexual assault as she reported from Cairo on the resignation of President Mubarak. She was surrounded by a mob of 200 - 300 men after being dragged away from her TV crew in Tahrir Square, seconds after Egyptian colleagues heard men talking about wanting to take her pants off. The group  tore her clothes from her body, groped and beat her, she later told\u00a0The New York Times. 'For an extended period of time, they raped me with their hands,' the reporter said and she was subjected to 'aggressive pinching'. She was rescued by a group of women and up to 20 Egyptian soldiers. Logan has since returned to the Middle East. On Sunday, 60 Minutes aired her report on the persecution of Iraqi Christians by ISIS. 'She did the story while ISIS was just four to six miles from where she was reporting,' Butowsky said. 'She did the story over the last four to six months on location in the face of ISIS all while suffering from the brutal sexual assault she suffered at the hands of evil forces at play during the Arab Spring.' CBS told Breitbart in an email: 'We were sorry to hear this morning that Lara was readmitted to the hospital. We wish her a speedy recovery.' 'In spite of everything she\u2019s had to face in the last two years, people have no idea the physical suffering she has been enduring due to the brutal sexual assault she encountered,' Logan's family friend Ed Butowsky (pictured left) said. A handful of weeks ago, CBS released a similar statement after Logan was admitted to hospital in late February, as she suffered internal bleeding reportedly from diverticulitis--a potentially stress-related intestinal condition. The foreign affairs correspondent has digestive diverticulitis, reported Page Six. The condition could have been aggravated by stress. She was expected to remain in the hospital for several days to recover. She had since been released at least long enough to complete her report on Iraqi Christians. Diverticulitis, according to the NIH website, occurs when when pouches, called diverticula, form in the colon and then become inflamed. The last few years have not been completely kind to the South Africa native. Aside from her beating and sexual assault in 2011, she was forced in 2011 to take a seven-month leave of absence after admitting her report on the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was based on a discredited first-hand account. And last year she was quarantined in South Africa after reporting from the Ebola hot zone in Liberia. Logan has been married to defense contractor Joseph Burkett since 2008. The couple have a son and daughter along with Burkett's daughter from a previous marriage, and live in DC. Lara Logan and her husband Joseph Burkett at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in DC in 2011. The couple have been married since 2008 and have two children together. Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system. They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common, especially after age 40, and seldom cause problems. Sometimes, however, one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected. That condition is known as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in your bowel habits. Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics. Severe or recurring diverticulitis may require surgery."}

Ronald J. Brockmeyer left his Ferguson position earlier this week after he was directly criticised in the report, which was prompted by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. He also left his post as a\u00a0Dellwood prosecutor. He has now announced he will no longer be the prosecuting attorney in Vinita Park and Florissant. Scroll down for video. Ferguson municipal court judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer (left) resigned on Monday following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Justice. He has also left three other roles. State appeals judge Roy L. Richter (right) was appointed to take his place in Ferguson. The report, released on March 4, singled out the 70-year-old and suggested he was behind Ferguson\u2019s aggressive strategy of using its municipal court to generate revenues. It added that Brockmeyer was particularly 'creative' when it came to traffic fines and fees, including dismissing tickets for himself and friends. Announcing his resignation Brockmeyer said he wanted to help the city 'begin its healing process' and to promote public confidence in the court. Roy L. Richter, a state appeals judge, was appointed by the Missouri Supreme Court to take his place and make 'needed reforms'. Richter will be authorized to overhaul court policies in order to'restore the integrity of the system' and ensure the respect of defendants' rights, according to the high court.\u00a0He will start on March 16. Chief Justice Mary Russell said she believes Richter will bring a 'fresh, disinterested perspective' to the court. 'He is able and willing to implement needed reforms,' she said. 'Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the Court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis.' But Vinita Park Mayor James McGee said that Brockmeyer\u2019s service would be 'dearly missed'. A Justice Department investigation found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court.\u00a0Brockmeyer stepped down to help the city 'begin its healing process', he said. Two Ferguson Police Department commanders - Rick Henke and William Mudd - also resigned last Thursday after racist emails were discovered by the DoJ's investigation, while Mary Ann Twitty, a court clerk, was fired. It is unclear whether the three were the recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report. The\u00a0St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u00a0reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job'. Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion'. The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DoJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week. Evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case'. In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails. Instead, the emails were forwarded along to others. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. Sgt. William Mudd (left) and Capt. Rick Henke (center) resigned from their positions on Thursday. City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty (right) was fired over racially charged emails discovered in the report. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DoJ's report'searing' and said the investigation showed policing and municipal court practices were 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents'. He said: 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles revealed last week that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DoJ,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reports. Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down. The DoJ's investigation into the St. Louis suburb came after a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson (right), fatally shot an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown (left), in August last year. The grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light.

The school's mission statement encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning, but Ms. Hsu believes that students' time would be better spent on activities such as playing video games, watching TV, or spending time outside.

According to local news site DNAinfo, Jane Hsu, who is the principal at P.S. 116 in Kips Bay, Manhattan, sent a letter home to the parents of all Pre-K through fifth grade students informing them that the school's teachers would no longer be assigning work for the children to do outside of school hours. She suggested that her students' time would be better spent focusing on other, more enjoyable, activities such as playing video games, watching TV or spending time outside. Scroll down for video. Putting her foot down: P.S. 116 principal Jane Hsu (left), pictured with assistant principal\u00a0Gary Shevell, has banned homework for pupils at her school. 'The topic of homework has received a lot of attention lately, and the negative effects of homework have been well established,' Ms Hsu explained to parents in the letter. 'They include: children's frustration and exhaustion, lack of time for other activities and family time and, sadly for many, loss of interest in learning.' Ms Hsu added that she was 'excited that we are redefining the landscape of homework', before going on to explain that she didn't believe she was 'eliminating' homework, but rather adjusting the expectations of both her parents and her pupils in terms of what that phrase means. But while her students are no doubt delighted at the news, their parents are less enthused by the school's decision. 'I was just thinking maybe I'll keep my daughter here for another year, but this pushed me over the edge,' Daniel Tasman, the father of a second grade pupil at the school, told DNAinfo. 'This is their time to learn now, when they have good memory,' said Stanley, the parent of a third grade pupil at P.S. 116. 'I give him extra work, though. I go to Barnes and Nobles and give him my own homework.' Ironically, the school's mission statement - which available on its website\u00a0- states clearly that pupils are expected to 'achieve high academic standards' and to 'take responsibility for their own learning'. Homework-free zone: Parents of the school's students are angry at Ms Hsu's decision, with one father going as far as to say he would pull his daughter from her class. 'Our school, P.S. 116, is a community of learners in which all children are encouraged to achieve high academic standards and social success, to enjoy learning, to celebrate diversity, to develop analytical skills, and to model exemplary behavior,' the website explains. 'We empower our students to take responsibility for their own learning by recognizing that effort leads to academic success. 'They are active participants and every child has a responsibility not just to perform a task, but to do it to the best of her or his ability.' But despite the anger and frustration being voiced by many parents however, Ms Hsu is adamant that she has made the best decision possible for pupils and added that she is 'looking forward' to seeing what 'positive impact' the school's new homework options will have on both the students - and their parents. And according to Peter Pizzolongo,\u00a0associate executive director at National Association for the Education of Young Children, Ms Hsu's theory is actually not as bizarre as some of the school parents might think. Speaking to Yahoo Parenting about P.S. 116's new homework policy, Mr Pizzolongo explained that, while children need 'the opportunity to apply what they have learned after they leave the school environment', that additional education time doesn't necessarily have to take the more traditional form of worksheets and book-based assignments. 'When kids engage in rough and tumble play outdoors, \"big body play\" we call it, they're not only enhancing their physical development, they're learning how to set limits in a social-emotional context, problem solve, and make decisions,' he added. 'These skills hit all the domains of learning.'"}

The 30-year-old is out of contract in the summer and negotiations over a new deal stalled at the beginning of the season and have never got going again. In January manager Brendan Rodgers said he was hopeful a solution could be found to keep the England international but with Johnson having lost his first-team place in the 3-4-2-1 formation which has been so successful since the turn of the year that now looks less likely.

He has long been linked with a move abroad - he has been free to talk to overseas clubs since January 1 - and the defender admits there have been discussions. Asked about his contract situation with Liverpool Johnson said: 'No talks. At this point I have no idea (where I will be next season). I haven't thought about it.' On his option to explore a move overseas he added: 'There are talks. It would be great for the kids to go abroad but I am not thinking about yet as we have two months left here and I'll think about it after that. 'We will have to wait and see.' Johnson warms up before the FA Cup Quarter Final match between Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers at Anfield. Ironically Johnson made his first start in 12 matches in Sunday's goalless FA Cup quarter-final draw at home to mid-tabled SkyBet Championship Blackburn. The team's performance was so alien to what fans have become accustomed to seeing since the turn of the year there were understandably some grumbles at Anfield but Johnson said it is inevitable players will be criticised when they fail to reach the high standards they have set themselves. Unbeaten in the Premier League since January 1 and playing football lauded as currently the best in the land has set a benchmark which is not always easy to achieve. Rovers stuck to their game plan of nullifying the threat of  Adam Lallana and it worked as they drew.

'That's football. You aren't going to play to the best of your ability in every game,' said Johnson. 'Whether you play well or not, the most important thing is that you don't go out of the cup. We're still in the draw and we can still win the tie. Johnson has no idea where he will be next season but it appears increasingly likely he will move overseas. Johnson's representatives have already held exploratory talks with foreign clubs in regards to a move. 'It was frustrating. Everyone wanted to win the game but the most important thing is that we're in the hat for the semi-finals. 'You've got to give Blackburn a lot of credit because they worked hard. They got men behind the ball. 'Hopefully we'll play better in the replay and get the win we want. 'The fixture list isn't too crowded for us now so having a replay isn't a big problem. 'We've got plenty of time on the training ground in between matches to work on things now. 'We're still confident we can go through. Hopefully we can pick up our performance.'

Wales international North left the field unconscious and in a neck brace but the club tweeted just before half-time that he was 'awake' and the player wrote on his own Twitter account on Saturday: 'Thanks for all the messages. Feeling ok, up and about.' George North was knocked out after colliding with Nathan Hughes' knee on Friday night.

Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen signed the order in a seven-minute hearing, three days after finding Heather Hironimus in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment unless she reported to court with the child. Her attorney, Thomas Hunker, said his client is staying with her 4-year-old son in a shelter for domestic violence victims because the boy was'scared to death' of undergoing the surgery. Dennis Nebus of Boca Raton, right, sits in court on Tuesday, with his lawyers May Cain and William Snihur, Jr., in a continuing legal battle with Heather Hironimus, the mother of his four-year-old son over circumcision. Warrant for arrest:\u00a0Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen signed the order in a seven-minute hearing, three days after finding Heather Hironimus in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment. Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, were never married but share custody of their child. 'I was hoping the mother was going to be here,' Nebus' attorney May L. Cain said on Tuesday. 'I was, too,' Gillen replied. The Florida Sun-Sentinel reports that the the judge last week called it'reprehensible' for the mom to have kept the boy's location hidden from the father since February \u00a020. 'I will allow her to avoid incarceration or get out of jail if she signs the consent to the procedure,' Gillen said Friday. In a parenting agreement filed in court, the two agreed to the boy's circumcision, but the mother later changed her mind, leading to a long court battle. The father said he decided to pursue the circumcision in December 2013 when the boy was 3, after noticing his son was urinating on his leg, reports The Sun Sentinel. The father on Friday said the boy's pediatrician had diagnosed a condition called phimosis, which prevents retraction of the foreskin and that can be cured with circumcision. Circuit and appellate judges have sided with the father, but potential surgeons have backed out after refusing to get the mother's consent or becoming the target of anti-circumcision protesters who side with her. Supporters of Heather Hironiumus gather out side of the South County Courthouse in Delray Beach, Florida where the mother was to face off in court with the father of her child, Dennis Nebus. 'She did this for one reason and one reason only: because the child is scared to death of this procedure,' Hunker told Gillen, launching into a defense that was cut off by the judge. 'So Mr. Hunker, I take it then that the mother is not going to appear today?' the judge said. 'Correct, your honor,' Hunker replied. 'OK, that's all I needed to know,' Gillen said. 'Your honor, if I may,' the lawyer pleaded. 'No, you may not,' the judge shot back. Although circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., a majority of boys still undergo the procedure to remove their foreskin. Meantime, a movement opposing circumcision has developed, and the case has become a rallying cry for so-called 'intactivists' who deride the surgery as barbaric. A small group of those anti-circumcision advocates gathered outside the court to demonstrate in support of Hironimus, and expressed outrage over the judge's order. 'It's just ridiculous,' said one of the protesters, Jennifer Cote of Pembroke Pines. 'She's protecting her son.'

As Every Hotels launched its first venue in Piccadilly, London last week, it was clear that this kind of question provides the thinking behind its brand. To find out what guests really want, London-based hotel group glh conducted research over the last two years, most recently asking 4,000 adults globally what matters most when staying in a hotel. Each room at Every Hotels' new location in Piccadilly boasts a Hypnos bed and a complimentary mini-bar. Top three were a great night's sleep (86 per cent), no hidden extras (81 per cent) and fast and efficient check-in (67 per cent). Turning its back on the traditional hotel rating system, Every Hotels is striving to meet the demands of guests looking for fully-equipped bedrooms in hotels without meeting rooms, spas or a plethora of restaurants and bars. The company has stripped back all the non-room features usually found in four-star hotels, and instead focuses on quality rooms and a personal service.

Every Hotel Piccadilly offers modern, well-equipped rooms with Hypnos beds, Nespresso machines, complimentary mini-bar, free wifi, a great location, hosts genuinely knowledgeable about the local area and the opportunity to choose your room before you arrive. What strikes me is that senior executives involved with the project are very realistic; in the sense that they recognise there are many restaurants and bars to choose from in central London, that tourists will spend most of their time walking around, and that most businessmen will have office meetings in offices. And so the focus is on the accommodation, the comfort, and having facilities that don't force themselves onto guests. The company's research showed them that 52 per cent of Brits wanted a Nespresso machine in the room. My deluxe room is spacious and bright with a clean and sharp finish.

Maybe that's because she was in the capable hands of Herb Ritts - widely considered one of the top photographers in the world until his death from AIDS in 2002 at the age of 50. The candid black-and-white portrait of Madonna is just one of dozens to be featured in a new hotly-anticipated exhibit of Ritts' work at the\u00a0Museum of Fine Arts in Boston opening tomorrow. Other celebrity subjects include everyone from a sultry Claudia Schiffer to a vest-wearing Richard Gere. Scroll down for video. The artist that Herb Ritts collaborated with most frequently was Madonna, whose whimsical Madonna, Tokyo (1987) was taken in her hotel when the Who\u2019s That Girl World Tour opened in Japan.

The retrospective revisits the legendary artist, whose groundbreaking 1996 show at the MFA, Herb Ritts: WORK, remains one of the most highly attended events in museum history with more than 253,000 visitors. According to the New York Times, though some have called Ritts 'formulaic, he 'belongs in the tradition of Richard Avedon, Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Irving Penn.' With a career that began in the late 1970's, the California-born Angelino rose to fame with his portraits and editorial shoots of fashion stars and celebrities. Ritts pointed his lens at Madonna, Michael Jackson, Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise to name but a few of the famous faces he snapped, publishing his work in such publications as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Interview and Rolling Stone. One of his sitter, Cindy Crawfiord once said of his work: 'There was something magical about when you stepped in front of his camera and what happened then. This give-and-take, and that\u2019s what makes it fun. Come hither: Claudia Schiffer struck a sultry pose for Ritts in 1992. Muscle man: Sylvester Stallone demonstrates his strength as he lifts Brigitte Nielsen on the beach in Long Island in 1987. Globetrotter: Ritts also worked with Turlington on a Gianni Versace advertising campaign, which took them to the dry Mojave Desert lakebed known as El Mirage, where the vast open space gave him a sense of creative freedom.

France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a'massive failure' Even the Correze department - Mr Hollande's home turf in the south west - was won by the UMP. Former president Mr Sarkozy said: 'Tonight, the Republican right, and the centre, has won the departmental elections.' Referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments.' Mr Sarkozy said 'three years' under the most outdated Socialist party in Europe had brought the country to its knees, and the electorate had had enough. Exit polls showed the opposition UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured) controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists. 'A new era is starting. Hope is reborn for France,' said Mr Sarkozy. 'The road will be long and hard, but change is coming and nothing can stop it.' Also highlighting the 'failure' of the Socialists, was the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen. Although the FN was expected to win up to one department maximum, they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils. Calling on Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, 'to resign', Ms Le Pen said her anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had a huge part to play in the future of France. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, conceded 'incontestable' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm. Far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen (pictured) also highlighted the 'failure' of the Socialists. Noting increased extremism in his country, Mr Valls said: 'Far-right gains in local elections are a sign of lasting change in the French political system'. The election will choose 4,108 local councillors and - crucially - shape the political landscape in the run-up to the 2017 presidential race. The vote was also a key test for Mr Sarkozy who, despite a series of corruption scandals, is convinced he can return to power in two years' time. According to the exit polls, the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists..

'I was trying to get to him - that was my only concern,' Mr Marnock told Daily Mail Australia. 'He had two storeys worth of debris and a tree on top of him. 'There was no hope, I just couldn't get to him. It was a complete feeling of absolutely helplessness.' The extent of the damage meant Mr Marnock and rescue workers couldn't access Eli's bedroom until after midnight. 'I stayed there until I got him out,' he said. 'I had the firies (fire service officers) with me, we ended up going through the wall in our bedroom cupboard.' And the tragedy could have been even worse. Mr Marnock said it was a nap in the car that saved the life of Eli's five-year-old sister Nicola \u2013 who wasn't tired and was on the couch watching TV instead of sleeping in the bedroom she shared with her little brother.

Mr Marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his 'cheeky' little boy who was his 'little dude' Earlier that day the family visited Mr Marnock's father's grave as it was the fifth anniversary of his death. When the family was back at home that evening, Nicola was on the couch watching TV and Mr Marnock and Eli's mother Suzie Surridge, 37, had walked to the front of the house to investigate the storm. 'We had actually stood up to go and look out the front door because we heard the gust of wind,' Ms Surridge said. 'We opened the front door but had to close it immediately because of the wind. 'Nicola had stayed sitting in the armchair then all of a sudden the tree from above us just came down on top.'

'We were able to get across over the debris to where Nicola was pinned, fortunately the angle of how things had gone down it didn't crush her upper chest or head,' she said. 'I was able to sit and speak with her and keep her talking the whole time.' Mr Marnock said Nicola was a 'little trooper' throughout the terrifying ordeal. 'She was just amazing,' he said. 'She got stressed out at times and she was a little bit concerned as to where Eli was - she knew she couldn't see their bedroom door.' It took an hour for rescue workers to free Nicola. She was taken to hospital where she was treated for injuries including bruising and a torn liver, but she did not suffer any broken bones or haemorrhaging. Mr Marnock's 13-year-old son Jesse, who was in a hallway when the tree came down and was not injured, ran up the street to get help from neighbours before the emergency services arrived. Ms Surridge said Eli's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard, and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.

Jack Fox, 14, from Southport, fell on the last run of the last day of a school skiing trip in the Alps during half-term. He suffered ice burns to his arms but miraculously survived the ordeal relatively unhurt. The costly picture: Jack Fox took this snap the moment before he fell on the last day of a school skiing trip in the Alps. Jack's injuries: Despite bouncing off rocks and ice during the fall he only needed treatment for ice burns on his arms after his jacket was pushed up to his elbows during the plunge. Jack's iPhone 4S, containing the last picture he took, also survived the fall. He said: 'The battery goes quite quickly now, but there is not a crack on it. After I had stopped falling I just saw it there and tried to turn it on but it wouldn't. Then, when I got to the hospital and it had dried out, it turned on.' Mum Amanda, 41, said Jack was disappointed the phone still worked. Jack had hoped the accident would land him a phone upgrade but his old mobile survived. She said: 'Jack has been after an iPhone 6 for ages and when it wouldn't turn on, he thought he was going to get a new one. But we are glad it came on because that was when he first spoke to me. 'My husband had been told that he had been airlifted off, but we didn't know about any injuries. His phone coming back on was like it was meant to be.' Jack said: 'I was facing forwards taking pictures of the scenery, and I was about to put my phone away when I started to slip and lose my footing. I was shouting for help as I was falling \u2013 but then I couldn't because I had snow in my mouth.' Most of Jack's horrified friends feared the worst as he tumbled down the mountain. Amanda added: 'Jack said when he got to the bottom of the mountain he knew he hadn't broken anything as everything moved.' At the top of the mountain, Jack said a lot of people had taken their helmets off to take photos. His mum Amanda said: 'Luckily he hadn't, because his helmet was all smashed. Kids think helmets are not cool but Jack has now realised that they are.' 'It was cracked and bits had fallen off it,' said Jack, 'As I was going down I was trying to stop myself by digging my boots in, but it flipped me over and hit my head \u2013 it was a scary experience and was the first time I've ever thought I was going to die.' He added: 'You do need a helmet. It has saved my life.' Reunited: The teenager (centre) is embraced by his mother Amanda (right) with his brother Ryan (left) After being airlifted off the mountain near Salzburg, in Austria, Jack was later treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital for severe ice burns. He said: 'As I fell, my jacket pushed up to my elbows and I got to one point when I started to slow down and I moved over on to one arm because the other one was hurting. That is when the left arm went bad.' Amanda said Jack's left arm was 'quite a mess'. She added: 'He is lucky to be here. It could have been a totally different story. 'He is here and can tell the tale, which is the important thing.' Jack feared the snap had cost him his life and said for the first time ever\u00a0he thought he was going to die during the experience."}

Tempers flared shortly after Manuel Pellegrini's men returned to the Anfield dressing room with the score at 1-1, according to the Mirror. Liverpool had opened the scoring when Fernandinho sold Kompany short and Philippe Coutinho nipped in before Jordan Henderson struck from long-range. A source told the paper team-mates feared the pair would come to blows after Fernandinho criticised his captain for his part in the goal. Kompany is said to have reacted furiously before Pellegrini told the Belgium centre-half that he should listen to his team-mate. The 28-year-old is then reported to have reacted even more angrily before rounding on anyone who challenged him. City went on to lose the game 2-1.

{"abstract": "A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point', according to experts who have called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target. The Nuffield Trust report argues that a set of 'richer performance indicators' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures. The authors of the report point out that A&E is only part of a broader urgent care system, and that GP practices, out-of-hours services and the telephone service NHS 111 all have key parts to play.", "article": "A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point' experts have today warned, as they called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target. A new report by the Nuffield Trust said an 'undue' focus on the national target can 'distort' behaviour inside hospitals 'in ways that are not in the interests of patients or staff'. Focus on the target can mean a significant amount of time is spent by staff reporting up the chain to those who commission healthcare, and regulators, with a potentially detrimental impact on the quality of care. The think tank's critique  What's Behind The A&E 'Crisis'? comes as NHS England reveals emergency departments have not achieved the benchmark in England since July 2013. It comes as the latest figures, published today, show performance is getting worse. In the week ending March 1, 91 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in A&E before being discharged or admitted to a hospital ward - short of the 95 per cent target. The Nuffield Trust think tank today warned\u00a0A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point', as they called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target. It marks a slight fall from the previous week, when performance was 92 per cent. But authors of the Nuffield Trust report argue that while the four-hour target has 'played an important part in improving patients' experiences', it is just one part of a complex system of urgent care. The report argues a set of 'richer performance indicators' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, and the report's co-author, warned: 'England's A&E system is near crisis. 'With the financial squeeze set to continue, there is no relief in sight if we keep up the current approach. 'We need to rethink our assumptions as many of the \"magic bullet\" solutions suggested miss the point. 'It's not about more people turning up, but about a system with a squeeze on hospital space and staff, which needs to get better at discharging people safely and on time.' Every minute of every day, an average of 40 patients arrive at emergency departments in England. The speed with which people move through A&E 'has come to be regarded as a sentinel marker of the health care system'. The chair of the British Medical Association, Dr Mark Porter, agreed, adding the four-hour wait has become 'disproportionate'. Responding to the Nuffield Trust briefing, he said: 'Doctors want to treat patients on the basis of their individual need, rather than an arbitrary target. 'Moving away from a system that prioritises targets above all else to one which takes a wider view of how services are performing would improve the quality of patient care by preventing rushed admissions, or leaving those most in need waiting longer for treatment. 95 per cent \u2013 the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in A&E before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital. 92 per cent \u2013 average performance against the four-hour target by major A&E departments in 2014. Three hours 43 minutes \u2013 the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving A&E. Two hours 17 minutes \u2013 the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is sent home after leaving A&E. More than one hour, four minutes \u2013 how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in A&E compared with those aged under 75. 'By fixating on one narrow measurement, we risk focusing on the symptoms rather than the causes of rising pressure on A&Es, which are linked to wider pressures across the NHS and social care sector. 'Cuts to social care mean hospitals have become a holding place for many older patients who can\u2019t be discharged because there is simply nowhere for them to go. 'This \u2018exit block\u2019 leads to bed shortages and patients waiting for hours on trolleys to be admitted. Outside of hospitals investment in general practice is declining while demand is on the rise and more care is moved into the community - this simply isn\u2019t sustainable.

After 120 exhausting minutes Diego Simeone\u2019s side won on penalties with Fernando Torres scoring the home side\u2019s last spot-kick and Stefan Kiessling missing his to put Atletico through. The dramatic climax began with Raul Garcia blazing the first kick over the bar. Substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak saved Hakan Calhanoglu\u2019s awful spot-kick hit low and straight down the middle to put the Spaniards back in with a chance of progress. Fernando Torres celebrates scoring his penalty which put Atletico Madrid into a crucial 3-2 lead during the shootout. Torres congratulates substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak following the Slovenian's impressive performance. Leverkusen's goalkeeper Bernd Leno is unable to stop Torres' penalty, leaving the German side with a mountain to climb. Oblak jumps for the decisive penalty from Stefan Kiessling, but didn't need to make a save as the shot sailed over his crossbar. Atletico Madrid players sprint towards Oblak's goal after Kiessling misses his penalty and hands the home side victory. A dejected Kiessling walks back to the centre circle knowing his spot-kick miss had handed victory to the home side.

Booked: Spahic, Toprak, Calhanoglu, Papadopoulos, Wendell. Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Bologna) Antoine Griezmann stepped up and showed everyone how penalties should be taken scoring high into the roof of the net. Simon Rolfes did likewise to level the scores and Mario Suarez scored his second goal of the night having put Atletico ahead in normal time. When Omer Toprak put his kick nervously over the bar Atletico looked to have the finish line in sight only for Bernd Leno to save Koke\u2019s kick. Gonzalo Castro then scored but after Torres had snuck his penalty just inside Leno\u2019s right hand upright Kiessling missed and the Calderon erupted with joy. Atletico came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in-roads early on with a Koke free-kick not really testing Leno. Simone\u2019s team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when Son Heugn-Min was put through by Bender on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target. As he came out to close down Son, Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Miguel Moya pulled a hamstring and had to be replaced by Oblak. Losing their keeper and having to use a substitute so early was a major set-back for Simeone but four minutes later he was running along the touchline as Atletico Madrid took the lead. Cani headed the ball down for Mario Suarez and his shot through the crowded penalty area caught and went past Leno to put the home side ahead on the night. With their next attack Atletico could have got the all-important second goal but a brilliant tackle from Wendell denied Mario Mandzukic. It was Arda\u2019s pefect through ball that put the Croatian striker through but as he delayed his shot the Brazilian defender clean swept the ball away from him to safety. It was brilliant defending but would any of Atletico Madrid\u2019s previous strikers \u2013 Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao, Diego Costa \u2013 have buried it before the defender could react? Probably yes. Turkish midfielder Arda Turan (right) was unable to watch the action during the penalty shootout.

Pyka and her son's estate have filed a lawsuit against Pop Warner for $5 million, claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players from head trauma.", "article": "(CNN)When Oakland Raiders NFL running back Maurice Jones-Drew retired recently at just 29 years old, he said his life had been focused on football for 24 years and he needed a change. It's no wonder he wanted out. He has been playing football since he was 5 years old. Sound too young to strap on a helmet? Not really. Jones-Drew is no different from thousands of other boys whose parents introduce them to the gridiron just a few years out of diapers. Football is America's favorite sport. We pride ourselves on our toughness, on our ability to get back up when we're knocked down. What better sport is there to teach those lessons? But today, youth football is not looking like the best option. In 2012, an estimated 225,287 children -- down 9.5% since 2010 -- between the ages of 5 and 14 played Pop Warner football, in which the weight class for the 5-year-olds ranges from 35 to 79 pounds. With such lightweight boys competing with children more than twice their size, it's no wonder parents feel less inclined to put their kids in this sport. But not too long ago, parents thought nothing of sending their children out on the football field to run around and burn up a little energy. Many parents still insist youth football is safe. What could be healthier for a boy? Certainly, it beats sitting in front of a computer all day. That's exactly what Debra Pyka thought when she signed up her son, Joseph Chernach, for Pop Warner football in Wisconsin, then later in Michigan, when he was 11 years old, in 1997. If only she knew then that her son would be dead at 25. Joseph hung himself in his mother's shed on June 7, 2012. His brain was later found to have severe CTE, a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions in football. Joseph Chernach had played sports, including wrestling, pole vaulting and football most of his young life. But he spent almost four years playing Pop Warner football from ages 11 to 14. \"My son was the class comedian, loved school, always fun to be around,\" Pyka told me. \"But we noticed after high school Joseph changed. He got depressed, angry, paranoid and withdrew from sports and his friends. We just didn't know why. After learning about CTE, I knew he had it even before we got the results. The symptoms were all there.\" Pyka is convinced those early days playing Pop Warner football triggered her son's CTE. Last month, Pyka and her son's estate filed a lawsuit against Pop Warner football for $5 million, claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players and warn them and their parents about the permanent dangers of head trauma. The lawsuit further alleges that Pyka's son and other children were intentionally put in danger because Pop Warner used amateur coaches with short tenures, who were never properly trained in the game of football, injury prevention, concussion or head injury identification. So now, this mother is on a mission. She wants to stop children younger than 14 from playing tackle football in youth leagues. \"I don't want any kids to suffer the way my son suffered, the way my family suffered. It's devastating. Young children should not be allowed to play tackle football until they reach high school,\" said Pyka. Since filing her suit, Pyka, a registered nurse, said she's found some solace by connecting with other parents who want to make football safer for children, but she also has received plenty of hateful emails criticizing her for allowing her son to play in the first place. Critics say that she knew what she was doing when she signed her son up to play football and some even suggest that Pyka should be charged with murder for allowing Joseph to sign up for football, Pyka told me, clearly upset. \"I didn't sign my son up to get a brain disease,\" she said. \"We wanted him to play sports, to be active. We knew nothing about concussions then. It wasn't discussed much. It's still not talked about enough today. Should we all be arrested for letting our kids play football?\" Clearly, the lawsuit faces obstacles, especially since Chernach did play other sports and it may be hard to prove the CTE was triggered by injuries suffered while playing for Pop Warner. But Pyka and her attorney, Gordon Johnson, at the Brain Injury Law Group, which is representing Chernach's estate, insist this case is not just about winning. They are going after the economics of youth football leagues. And if they win the lawsuit it may be less possible for those leagues to buy the insurance policies that allow very young children to play tackle football. \"We have to prove that Pop Warner was a substantial factor in him getting it [CTE], and we knew from research that playing under 12 is when you're most vulnerable,\" Johnson told media when he filed the suit. \"The airing of these issues will benefit everybody,\" he added.

Day breaks at Hall\u2019s Harbour in Nova Scotia and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight. Suddenly the tide begins to rise in the distance and as water rushes through to the harbour the boats begin to rock on the surface of the bay. The surface remains frozen throughout the video, but a gap in the ice on the left shows water flooding onto the side of the bank as the level rises. Before long the water has risen to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on the top of the ice. As the tide begins to rise water rushes through to the harbour and the boats begin to rock on the surface. Two men can be seen shovelling snow from one of the boats as the water level begins to decrease once more. They leave for the day as nightfall approaches, and darkness soon cloaks the scene. The Bay of Fundy, which has contested for world tidal dominance with the Leaf Basin in Ungava Bay, Canada, achieved the record for the highest water level ever at the head of Minas Basin on the night of the \u2018Saxby Gale\u2019 on October 4, 1869. In 1975, the Guinness Book of World Records declared that Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia has the highest tides in the world. The water rises to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on top. According to oceanographers, tidal resonance resulting from a coincidence of timing is the cause for the dramatic increase in water levels.

He's going to end up either cutting our National Health Service or raising VAT. \u2018The truth at the election will be, do you want Labour's more balanced, fairer approach to deficit reduction, which focuses on raising wages and being fair, or do you want to go for even deeper spending cuts over the next three years?\u2019"}

Authorities in the country quickly said no after Valentina Maureira's YouTube video pleading to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis began spreading on social media last month. Now the girl is reconsidering after meeting others living with her disease. Scroll down for video. Valentina Maureira, 14, has said she is reconsidering her wish to end her cystic fibrosis with assisted suicide after meeting others surviving with the disease. Above, she met with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. A YouTube video made by the young girl (right) quickly spread through social media in Chile, prompting a response from the government. 'There are people that made \u200b\u200bme change the way of thinking,' Maureira told the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio,. 'It's a difficult decision,' she said, according to 24Horas.Cl. She said that the idea to end her life first began when she heard about the case of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old American with terminal brain cancer who died by doctor-assisted suicide last year. Maureira then grabbed the \u00a0attention of the country after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Fredy Maureira said his daughter was moved by a visit by a family from Argentina, whose children have been stricken by the incurable respiratory illness. He said she also was given hope by meeting someone who had survived beyond age 20 with the disease. Maribel Oviedo and her father Ernesto traveled to Santiago to 'convey a message of hope,' according to\u00a0La Voz. The young girl met with Maribel Oviedo (right) 22, of Argentina, who watched her sister died of cystic fibrosis but survived herself after receiving a lung transplant for the disease. Oviedo said that she wanted to deliver a'message of hope' to Maureira and prove that it is possible to live a 'normal life' after struggling with the disease. The Argentine still maintains a Facebook page dedicated to her sister (pictured) who died of cystic fibrosis in 2013. Maribel, 22, from Cordoba, watched her sister Marisol die of cystic fibrosis in 2013. She received a lung transplant in 2012 and told the girl that she now lives a normal life. The Argentine offered to go to a doctor's appointment with her because she wants to encourage Maureira to live. They also shared contact information for doctors in Brazil. 'Mission accomplished... the decision was positive. She wants to travel to Brazil,' Oviedo posted on Facebook after meeting with the Chilean. Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. The young Maureira said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. Euthanasia is not legal in Chile. The country's president Michelle Bachelet visited her in a hospital late last month and spoke with the girl and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in Santiago. What was said was not released, but the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Maureira taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Many people reached out to the girl after hearing about her video, including the president (center) and an Argentine family whose children also have cystic fibrosis. A Chilean presidential spokesman said 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish' Fredy Maureira said that his daughter asked for quality hospitals to fight cystic fibrosis, a marathon for the disease and help making a movie and book about her story. The president responded by sending back a tape recorder for her to take down impressions of her experience, according to Univision. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish.' The girl's father said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Mr Maureira said. He now says that his daughter is 'thinking about' her choice. The Chilean health ministry began providing Maureira with psychological assistance as well as medical treatment after getting in touch with her.

In a scathing assessment, the left-leaning Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the Labour leader\u2019s vow to bring down fees from \u00a39,000 \u2018sounds progressive\u2026 but sadly it isn\u2019t\u2019. The charity said there were \u2018better ways\u2019 to use the \u00a33billion-a-year cost of the policy to help the poor, such as increasing spending on sixth-form colleges in poorer areas. Coming under fire from left: The\u00a0Joseph Rowntree Foundation has criticised\u00a0Ed Miliband\u2019s flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to \u00a36,000. It also pointed out that because low-paid graduates eventually have their fees written off, the policy would \u2018mainly benefit mid to high-earning graduates who\u2019d otherwise have been repaying all or most of their loans\u2019. Also, there was \u2018no evidence\u2019 the rise in fees under the Coalition had hit the level of applications from poorer students, said the foundation, which added: \u2018Even if poorer students are put off, there is no evidence that these students would be much less deterred by fees of \u00a36,000 than \u00a39,000. \u2018The biggest factor preventing young people from poorer backgrounds from going to university is that the majority do not get good enough results at school to even attempt it.\u2019 Launching the policy last week, Mr Miliband said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011. The Tories have opened a three point lead over Labour in a poll. They are up to 34 per cent with Labour on 31 in the survey from former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft. Last week\u2019s Ashcroft poll had Labour in the lead. The new poll shows 42 per cent of voters believe Britain would be burdened with more debt under a Labour government. For the Tories it is 11 per cent. Labour is well ahead on improving the NHS. He insisted poorer students would benefit, adding: \u2018The scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people, it is a burden on our country.\u2019 But the proposal has been condemned as \u2018financially illiterate\u2019 by experts. University vice-chancellors are sceptical that a Labour government would make up the shortfall in fees. And many in Mr Miliband\u2019s inner circle fear his plan for a \u00a33billion-a-year raid on the pensions of the better-off to fund his eye-catching initiative will cost the party votes. Former Labour leadership contender Diane Abbott told LBC radio yesterday: \u2018I think it\u2019s generally understood that Ed was the person in his shadow cabinet who felt most strongly about doing something on tuition fees.\u2019 At a People\u2019s Question Time event in Brighton yesterday, Mr Miliband was accused of \u2018electioneering\u2019 by a member of the public, who identified herself only as Francesca. Launching the policy last week, Mr Miliband said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011. She told him: \u2018I would like to know why you are cutting the tuition fees in the light that a record number of students from poorer backgrounds are applying to university. 'And also the fact that it\u2019s middle-class, better-off students who are going to be paying less. \u2018The only conclusion I can get to is that it smacks of electioneering.\u2019"}

Mrs Pugh, who now has three children,\u00a0Daisy, six, Tizzy, four, and Teddy, two, with husband Andy, 37, a warehouse manager, said she was embarrassed by what her daughter saw when she looked at her 19-stone mother. She said: \u2018It was so embarrassing when I saw the picture that Daisy had drawn. I didn\u2019t realise that my children saw me as looking so huge.' Caroline Pugh, 33, used to weigh nearly 19 stone (left) but was shocked into losing seven stone (right) after her daughter drew a picture of her as a 'fat blob' Despite having broken a chair just by sitting on it while pregnant, Caroline says it was the embarrassment of seeing a drawing by daughter Daisy (left drawing in picture), which really gave her the motivation she needed to lose weight. Caroline continued: \u2018I got so tired running around after them all the time, my weight meant that I couldn\u2019t keep up with them properly at all, which did upset me. 'When I saw that picture I knew that I really had to do something about losing weight.' Though it wasn't the first sign that her weight was getting out of hand, Caroline admits it was the trigger she needed. She said: \u2018I\u2019d tried to push it to the back of my mind. With three young children to look after, my own appearance wasn\u2019t a priority, but my health was suffering too. 'When I was 12 weeks pregnant with Teddy I actually broke a kitchen chair.

Before her weight loss Caroline used to skip breakfast, and snack on bread and crisps all day. Instead of home-cooked dinners, she says she'd eat takeaways several times a week with husband Adam. She continued: \u2018This drawing really brought it home to me. I didn\u2019t want my children drawing pictures of their fat mummy anymore.' Before she changed her diet, Caroline ate crisps and up to three sandwiches or sausage rolls for lunch, before gorging on pizza and takeaways for dinner. She said: 'My diet was awful before.

Swapping her old diet for low fat cereal with skimmed milk at breakfast, and homemade, healthier lunches, Caroline has now dropped five dress sizes and weighs a much lighter 12 stone. She said: \u2018Everything has totally changed since I\u2019ve lost all this weight, I feel like a completely different person.

The British team showed their strength on the final climb of the Croix de Chaubouret and the pair punched the air after both making valuable moves towards the yellow jersey.

In one area, Greater Manchester, the fall has been even more sharp, and is down by 80 per cent. Official figures also showed worrying falls in the number of court cases brought against other driving offences, including those for drink drive offences, and dangerous driving. That is despite evidence deaths occuring as a result are on the rise. The number of drivers hauled before the courts for using mobile phone at the wheel has plummeted by nearly half. Stock photo. The figures were compiled by Labour, which warned that reckless drivers were \u2018getting away with it\u2019 and blamed cuts to the police front line. Shadow roads minister Richard Burden said: \u2018Road users have had enough of reckless drivers getting away with it. \u2018Under the Conservative-led Government progress on road safety is slowing while more and more drivers go unpunished for dangerous and drink driving. \u2018The hands-off approach to enforcement is not working. Crashes from mobile phone use are on the rise but thousands fewer drivers are being punished for this deadly offence.\u2019 The research follows calls from Britain\u2019s top traffic officer for drivers caught using their mobiles at the wheel to be banned. Gloucester chief constable Suzette Davenport said the rise in offending meant tougher punishments were needed, and accused ministers of failing to act for fear of offending voters. An estimated 500,000 motorists break the law every day but ordinarily using a hand-held mobile at the wheel usually attracts only a \u00a3100 fine with three penalty points. Figures also showed worrying falls in the number of court cases brought against other driving offences, including those for drink drive offences. Stock photo. The new data shows police are using formal powers to prosecute much less often. Across England and Wales, the number of prosecutions for using a mobile at the wheel fell from 35,255 to 19,650 between 2013 and 2011. That is a fall of 15,605, or 44 per cent. In Greater Manchester, the number of prosecutions fell from nearly 2,000 in 2010 to just 329 in 2013. Falls of more than 60 per cent were seen in the Cumbria, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Midlands, Warwickshire and Kent police areas. Research has suggested using a mobile slows reactions more than cannabis or alcohol use. Drivers\u2019 reactions fell by half while holding their phone and on a call, more than a third when texting and by a quarter during a hands-free call. The number of crashes attributed to mobile phone use has grown by 12 per cent, from 378 in 2012 to 422 last year. The alternative to a formal prosecution is a fixed penalty notice, but the number of these handed out is also down by 26 per cent. Drink drive deaths rose by one fifth from 2011-12 and while the numbers prosecuted for drink driving offences is down nine per cent. Miss Davenport, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on road issues, told the BBC on Sunday: \u2018If someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications. \u2018If we don\u2019t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this. I have had those conversations with ministers. I would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement. The minister doesn\u2019t like my proposal.\u2019 Ministers rejected the claim they were blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons and accused chief constables of taking the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers."}

The trek will be the third Walking with the Wounded expedition for Harry, who previously joined servicemen battling their way to the North Pole in 2011 and the South Pole in 2013. Next stop: Harry, pictured with the Kiwi Invictus team last September, will also tour New Zealand. Royal duties: Most think Harry should combine official work (pictured) with a regular job. Role model: Harry, who regularly tops royal popularity charts, is also considered a good role model by most. Speaking at the event yesterday, Harry reiterated his commitment to helping wounded veterans and also revealed that leaving the military would be 'challenging' for him. 'The public\u2019s support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he added. 'However, as the memory of our military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan fade, we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life. 'This process can be challenging, as it is for anyone seeking a new career. As I make this transition myself, I'm determined to do all I can to help others.'"}

Guests should be aware that not all items in the room are free, and should take precautions such as bringing their own sanitizer and bottled water. Additionally, it is important to tip generously and be aware of the minibar prices to avoid any unexpected charges.", "article": "When you first enter your hotel room, it's tempting to immediately head toward the minibar, brew yourself a cup of coffee or raid the toiletries that have been supplied for you. But, before you get carried away, there are a few things that you should know. Your stately room is likely not as clean as you believe it to be. And those goodies you're eager to try out? They may not actually be free. MailOnline Travel reveals the most important things to know about your hotel room, including those that no one will ever tell you... Hotel rooms may appear clean, but there are certain areas the cleaning staff don't often have time to inspect. Beware when touching the television remotes and light switches. A study\u00a0by the University of Houston revealed that the most touched places in the room such as television remotes and bedside lamp switches are often the least cleaned. Results found that in some cases, they had as much bacteria as bathroom toilet seats and sinks. That's enough for us to remember to pack our hand santizer whenever we travel! Pack your sanitizer for items like remotes and light switches which are hot spots for germs. Drinking from the bathroom glasses. You may be tempted to quench your thirst when you arrive and use the bathroom glasses for a drink. However in an\u00a0expose\u00a0by Fox News, it was revealed that many hotel maids do not wash them out with soap before the next guest checks in. Hidden cameras revealed glasses that were rinsed only with water, or that were wiped down with a cloth that had previously been used for cleaning the room. Use bottled water, or request plastic cups from reception to be safe. Think before you snuggle up in the blankets. Due to a lack of seating area in some hotels, the bed becomes the place where most people sit, eat, and perform other, ahem, intimate activities. Some mothers even change their child's nappies on the blankets, too. While you have no need to worry about items that get washed daily, some of the smaller blankets may not get replaced that often. It is advisable to check user comments before staying at a hotel so that you are aware of the experiences of other guests. Don't assume that everything is free. Everyone loves to stock up on the hotel-provided shampoo, shower cap and biscuits, but guests should never assume that everything is up for grabs. While pens and brochures are often free to use and take, items such as bathrobes, slippers may not be. Travelodge have noted a number of items being taken out their rooms that are supposed to remain. Shakila Ahmed, Travelodge spokeswoman said: 'Since we have introduced our new brand design and modernised our rooms, we have seen a significant rise in our fluffy pillows, snuggly duvets, striped bed runners and contemporary artwork being taken from our 500 UK hotels. 'There have even been attempts to smuggle our new luxurious king size Travelodge Dreamer bed out of the hotels.' Don't threaten to leave a bad TripAdvisor review in change for perks. Unfortunately, some people resort to blackmail to receive\u00a0upgrades\u00a0and free perks, in exchange for not writing a negative comment on the hotel's TripAdvisor page. If you are tempted to use this technique, take note: hotels have a way of\u00a0proactively reporting any threats before a corresponding review is submitted. A spokesperson for the online review site said: 'It is absolutely against the terms and spirit of our site to use TripAdvisor's name to try and claim discounts or freebies that would not be available to other guests. 'Our fraud detection experts will then investigate and, where we find evidence of threatening behaviour, take action to stop their reviews from ever reaching the site.' The mini bar items are extremely over-priced for what you get, bring your own snacks for guilt-free feasting. Keep your name and room number private. Telling other guests your full name and room number can lead to unwanted visitors and charges finding their way to your room. Set your own wake up call. On occasion, the front desk will forget to call you for your 3am flight reminder. Eliminate the risk and set your phone alarm yourself. Take hand santizer. Even if the room passed the cleaning inspection, there are still corners that the staff may not have reached. Keep yourself protected and always carry a bottle on trips. Request the top floor or a corner room. The top floor rooms tend to have higher ceilings, better views and less noise than other rooms. Corner rooms also tend to be larger - regardless of the floor its on. Tip generously. Leaving a little something for the staff gives a great impression and shows that you're grateful for their service. Plus, it doesn't hurt for them to remember your generosity when you have a request during your stay. Don't go crazy with the minibar. When you're nice and cosy, it can be tempting to see what the minibar has to offer, as opposed"}

Has your job moved farther from your home? You're probably right on both counts. A new study from the Brookings Institution says the number of jobs within a typical commute distance for residents in major metro areas of the U.S. fell by 7% between 2000 and 2012. Despite trends that indicate a greater desire for millennials to live in dense urban areas, suburbs are still doing well, according to some researchers. Employers have tended to move toward the suburbs, away from city cores -- and away from many workers, the study says. Moreover, even if you already live in the suburbs, it doesn't mean you live close to the suburb where the jobs are. \"Suburban residents saw the number of jobs within a typical commute distance drop by 7%, more than twice the decline experienced by the typical city resident (3%),\" Elizabeth Kneebone and Natalie Holmes wrote in the study's summary. The issue disproportionately affects poor and minority residents, the authors added. \"Residents of high-poverty and majority-minority neighborhoods experienced particularly pronounced declines in job proximity,\" they wrote, observing that 61% of high-poverty tracts and 55% of majority-minority neighborhoods experienced declines in job proximity between 2000 and 2012. High-poverty neighborhoods were defined as tracts with poverty rates above 20%. The Brookings study comes as metro areas are coping with increased stresses on infrastructure. Tuesday's New York Times was filled with letters complaining about a subway fare increase and crowds at all hours in the New York system. In Atlanta, one suburban county recently added mass transit for the first time since 2010 -- even as the Georgia legislature has been gutting portions of a transportation bill. And a Detroit man garnered nationwide headlines in February because of his 21-mile commute -- a hefty chunk of which he walked due to a lack of transit options. The Brookings study observes that solving commuting issues \"will require collaborative solutions\" across jurisdictions. \"The dynamics that have shaped these job proximity patterns across and within metro areas did not emerge by themselves,\" Kneebone and Holmes wrote (PDF). \"Local, regional, and state leaders put them in play (whether purposefully or by default) through policy decisions. To foster growth that is truly regional in its reach and that does not exacerbate inequality or leave low-income and minority residents behind, communities will need to coordinate and collaborate as they plan and implement policy decisions that affect metropolitan development patterns.\""}

Scroll down for video. Fantastic Pit in Ellison's Cave, Georgia, USA, is 586ft deep - almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty. The climb is strictly for the experienced, and the equipment as well as the training for the descent has to be of the highest standard. The pit is part of a 12-mile-long underground system, has been on the bucket list of the explorers for some time. Amy revealed the pit, which is part of a 12-mile-long underground system, has been on her bucket list for some time. In order to capture her spectacular shots she carries a lightweight camera kit and travels with a lighting assistant, Brian Stoltz. Amy, 28, from Huntsville, Alabama, said: 'I've been doing this for quite a few years now so the depth doesn't bother me as much. 'I just think to myself 'yes, that's a deep pitch-black hole in the floor'. Fantastic Pit, that is taken on as a challenge by many thrill-seekers, is almost twice as high as the Statue of Liberty. One of the group, Amy Hinkle, insists if proper training is done, 'caving is a relatively safe sport' Climber Ken Williams gets himself warmed up, before descending the 586 feet of America's deepest pit. Intrepid explorer Amy Hinkle (pictured) and a group including Shane Streetman and Elliot Hellman tackled the pit last month. 'We communicate via radio so I can direct the lighting for the shot. 'Caving is a relatively safe sport if it is done with proper training, gear and experience.' Also in the area is Incredible Pit, the second deepest pit in the US at 440ft. Due to the technical and dangerous nature of Ellison's Cave, it is generally explored by only the most experienced and capable cavers. Beginning cavers  are severely discouraged from entering and negotiating the cave. There have been a number of deaths, largely due to hypothermia, on various climbs in Ellison Cave. The vertical sections of the cave require extensive knowledge and practice of single rope technique climbing, including practice on heavy ropes and in wet environments. There have sadly been a number of fatalities concerning Ellison Cave. On March 10, 1999, a caver climbing the Incredible pit became tangled in multiple ropes and was stranded 140 feet off the cave floor underneath water falling into the pit. The incident resulted in fatality due to hypothermia. The vertical sections of the cave require extensive knowledge and practice of single rope technique climbing. The entrance to the pit is very deceiving, and you wouldn't believe it hides an underground world. Then on February 12, 2011 two University of Florida students died of hypothermia after becoming stuck on rope near a waterfall close to the bottom of a 120 foot pit. On May 26, 2013 a caver was rescued and hospitalized after falling 40 feet in the cave. It took 21 hours to evacuate the caver, including hauling up Fantastic Pit."}

He was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in October.

Mr Gambaccini\u00a0told the Home Affairs Select Committee the police had launched a 'witch hunt' to protect their reputation. Travis was convicted of molesting a 22-year-old researcher in September, just weeks before the case against Mr Gambaccini was dropped. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Savile which exposed the police's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile. 'I faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case,' he told the Home Affairs Select Committee. He said:\u00a0'Someone whose identity we do not know, who I call the Wizard of Oz, the person sitting behind the curtain, pulling the levers, setting off smoke and light shows, decided \"I've got a great idea, let's have a witch-hunt, let's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop Jimmy Savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s''.' The furious BBC DJ added:\u00a0'When you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities, then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention.' He told MPs there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail. 'It's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame, because my name got out to the press '[but] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry.' He added: 'You don't need a witch hunt to enforce the law.' He also accused the Crown Prosecution Service of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases, such as the Rolf Harris trial, in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him. Mr Gambaccini blamed his arrest on the'moral panic' sparked by the revelations over Jimmy Savile which exposed the police's failure to tackle abuse over decades. Mr Gambaccini told MPs he was 'left out to dry' until the end of the case against Dave Lee Travis. He also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against Rolf Harris (right) While Mr Gambaccini was making the accusation it emerged Harris had been stripped of his CBE, awarded to him by the Queen. The 84-year-old Australian was awarded the CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven-years-old. Mr Gambaccini said he had lost faith in the British justice system and revealed he had lost \u00a3200,000 in wages and legal fees after his arrest. The US-born DJ was re-bailed several times during his ordeal \u2013 and only found out about one after it had been reported to the BBC and ITV. Mr Gambaccini accused the CPS of having'sat on the case' for eight months and said he 'enthusiastically' supports 28-day bail limit.\u00a0He said the only reason for delay is to 'get someone else to accuse you'. Mr Gambaccini had his bail extended  when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for indecent assaults. He told the committee that during that time, his bail was extended on seven occasions with only 'vague' explanations from police, but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the Yewtree investigation. Bail was extended on May 2, when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults, on June 30, hours after the conviction of Rolf Harris and on September 12, when former Stoke Mandeville doctor Michael Salmon appeared in court charged with rape, he said.

The People's Daily Online reports that eagle-eyed staff are keeping watch over photo-enthusiasts in the palace's narrow or crowded areas, as well as all the indoor exhibitions, to avoid any potentially costly accidents. Ban: The Forbidden City has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur. 'Selfie sticks will cause safety concerns, whether for tourists or the exhibits,' Shen Lixia, deputy director of the museum's tourist reception department, told China Daily. 'It may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics.' She added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas, the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all. However, the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the Forbidden City - so tourists can still get the all-important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background. There was speculation that the move could be the first step to a total ban, as has been implemented at other cultural attractions around the world. It is thought the Louvre in Paris will bring in a ban in the next few weeks, while several football stadiums have banned them over fears the extendable devices could be used as a weapon. But it seems should the Forbidden City instill a total ban in mobile-mad China - there are said to be 19,300 versions of the selfie stick available on the country's answer to eBay, Taobao - they would have a fair amount of support. Popular: Chinese tourists use'selfie sticks' to take pictures as they stand on Jingshan Park, overlooking the Forbidden City, in February. There are more than 19,000 versions of the sticks for sale on Taobao. 'Museum photos are good for spreading the cultural messages, but we should pay attention to our ways,' Cao Wei, a celebrated Sina Weibo blogger, told People's Daily. 'I support the museums' actions on the selfie stick ban.'"}

A superb brace from Felipe Anderson gave Lazio a 2-0 win at Torino which took them clear of Napoli in third place, the Champions League playoff spot, in another of Monday's games. Monday's defeat at Fiorentina heaped more pressure on Filippo Inzaghi. Fiorentina's winning goal came after chaotic scenes at the Artemio Franchi stadium where the referee went off injured and the teams kept playing before he had been replaced, apparently unaware there was nobody in charge of the match. In driving rain, Mattia Destro put Milan ahead against the run of play when he diverted Giacomo Bonaventura's shot into the net from 12 metres in the 56th minute. Milan, who conceded a 95th minute equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Verona in their previous game, held on until Gonzalo Rodriguez headed in Joaquin's cross with seven minutes left. Gonzalo Rodriguez headed in Joaquin's cross to level in the 83rd minute against Milan. Joaquin scored the winner for Fiorentina with a header in the 89th minute. Referee Carmine Russo was replaced by the fourth official amid confusion shortly afterwards. Milan, joint tenth with 35 points from 27 games, appeared to lose concentration and allowed Joaquin to score the winner with another header in the 89th minute. Milan coach Inzaghi, whose future is the subject of speculation after almost every draw or defeat, left the pitch looking thoroughly soaked and miserable.

The 21-year-old has been in sparkling form for Spurs this season - having netted 29 goals in all competitions so far. 1966 World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst believes Kane has what it takes to shine on the international stage for Roy Hodgson's side. 1966 World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst (left) believes Harry Kane has what it takes to be an England star. Thrill of a debut. I\u2019ll never forget what it was like getting that first call. It was the start of 1966 and West Ham\u2019s manager Ron Greenwood took me aside in training and said I had been picked for a game against Poland. It was real elation even if I didn\u2019t play. I made my debut a month later against West Germany. Why this is relevant to Harry is the confidence you get from reaching that level. That could be a very big factor for this lad. Hurst made his debut for England in a 1-0 friendly win against West Germany in February 1966. Confidence. Self-belief is a huge thing in football, especially for strikers. When I got my England debut I felt 10 feet tall. With the season Harry has had, and now this selection, his extra confidence means we should be able to expect even more from him. The challenge will be doing it again next season. People will analyse how you mark him, how you stop him. It will be very interesting to see how he reacts to that. I would say he is not vulnerable to that, when I think about his character. Kane could make his England debut against Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night at Wembley. Character. What I like is that Harry has not had it all his own way - he had to fight to get in, he had to go out on loan. It has not been smooth. I wasn\u2019t a world-class player coming through but we have seen lots of players who have become more successful than those around them with more talent. Dedication and attitude are such key traits and Harry has those in abundance. I saw him receive an award recently at a charity dinner. You could see how level-headed he is. Kane has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the Tottenham first-team this season. The Ingredients. Looking at Harry, I am reminded of a speech I heard years ago by Bill Shankly. He was talking about Chelsea\u2019s Peter Osgood and said: \u2018Peter is deceptive - he is much slower than you think he is.\u2019 I liken that to Harry. He is deceptive - he is much better than you think he is. Harry is a bit like Thomas Muller, the Bayern Munich and Germany forward. On your first glance at Muller, he doesn\u2019t look like a footballer. He has his socks down his shins, looks ungainly. But he\u2019s a fantastic player. I liken Harry to that type of all-round player. Hurst believes Kane's deceptive style of play can be compared to Germany forward Thomas Muller (right) Strengths. I like how he shoots. He is almost always on target. He can score from distance or a tap-in - and that is a whole different skill. He can anticipate and poach. He has excellent technique. He strikes the ball cleanly and that is why he is often on target. It is also why he is so good at keeping the ball low. How often do you see him shoot over? The other thing is they come from all directions. He will still be unpredictable next year because there is not one set place he shoots from. Kane (left) battles for the ball against Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason during England training on Thursday. It helps that he is so comfortable with each foot, unlike a lot of players today. More than that, Harry has football intelligence which is especially important for strikers. His awareness of space on the pitch is very good. Throw in the fact he is very, very good in the air, strong physically and willing to press and defend, and you have a striker to be excited about. He is a team player. I will save my excitement until the end of next season to see if he has done it again - look at Ravel Morrison - but Harry looks very good. Hurst is impressed with Kane's (right) ability to shoot off either foot as well as his ability in the air. Weaknesses. I don\u2019t think he has electric pace. But I didn\u2019t have that and it didn\u2019t do me any harm. He is not slow - he can still run at players - but it is not electric pace. Teddy Sheringham was like that and I think Harry has Teddy\u2019s intelligence. Despite a lack of pace, Teddy Sheringham made 51 appearances for England - scoring 11 goals.

We are all united in great grief.\" Departure: Barcelona, Spain, at 10:01 a.m. (26 minutes late) Destination: Scheduled to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, at 11:39 a.m. Passengers: 150 (144 passengers, six crew members) Airplane: Airbus A320 (twin-jet) Airline: Germanwings (budget airline owned by Lufthansa) Flight distance: 726 miles.

Flight 9525 took off just after 10 a.m. Tuesday from Barcelona, Spain, for Dusseldorf, Germany, with 144 passengers -- among them two babies -- and six crew members. It went down at 10:53 a.m. (5:53 a.m. ET) in a remote area near Digne-les-Bains in the Alpes de Haute Provence region. All aboard are presumed dead. Helicopter crews found the airliner in pieces, none of them bigger than a small car, and human remains strewn for several hundred meters, according to Gilbert Sauvan, a high-level official in the Alpes de Haute Provence region who is being briefed on the operation. Authorities were not able to retrieve any bodies Tuesday, with the frozen ground complicating the effort. Wednesday may not be much easier, with snow in the forecast. Spanish and German officials moved to join hundreds of French firefighters and police in the area, working together to help in the recovery effort and try to figure out exactly what happened. As of Tuesday evening, there were few clues. One of the aircraft's data recorders, the so-called black boxes, has been found, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, but it was too early to tell what it would say about the crash. \"We don't know much about the flight and the crash yet,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \"And we don't know the cause.\" Relatives of those believed to be on the flight, fearing the worst, gathered at the Barcelona airport, where a crisis center was set up. French authorities set up a chapel near the crash site. Lufthansa Group said the company will look after the relatives of those on board. \"There will be a contact center established in France; relatives who would like to take advantage of this will be transferred to the contact center at no cost -- and their accommodation paid for -- just as soon as the center has been established,\" Lufthansa said. Those aboard included a \"high number of Spaniards, Germans and Turks,\" according to Spain's King Felipe VI. Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said it's believed 67 people, or nearly half those on the plane, are German citizens. Germanwings crash: Who was on the plane? Sixteen students and two teachers from one German high school, called Joseph Koenig Gymnasium, were among those booked on Flight 9525, according to Florian Adamik, a municipal official in Haltern, the town where the school is located. A crisis center has been established at the city hall in Haltern, which is about 77 kilometers (48 miles) north of Dusseldorf's airport. Winkelmann confirmed the 16 students and two teachers were on the plane. Haltern's mayor, Bodo Klimpel, said they had been heading home after taking part in a foreign exchange program. \"The whole city is shocked, and we can feel it everywhere,\" Klimpel said. A Dutch citizen and a Belgian -- the latter a resident of Barcelona -- were among those on the flight, according to those countries' foreign ministries. Two Australians and two Colombians were also believed to be on board. Germanwings started in 2002 and was taken over by Lufthansa seven years later as its low-cost airline, handling an increasing number of midrange flights around Europe. It was forced to cancel some flights Tuesday because there were crews that didn't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash. The valley where the plane went down is long and snow-covered, and access is difficult, said the mayor of the nearby town of Barcelonnette, Pierre Martin-Charpenel. It was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now, he said. It's an out-of-the-way"}

While they were searching with permission of the resident, they were tipped off that Wallace had posted a new Snapchat message saying police were in the house looking for him and he was hiding in a cabinet. Police wrote: 'A search of the kitchen cabinets turned up some food, some pots and pans, and also a pair of feet. 'The pair of feet just so happened to be attached to a person, and that person was Christopher Wallace. The police added: 'He was removed from the cabinet, and placed under arrest. All of that, brings me to the moral of the story. Always remain humble, my friends.' Erika Hall, 20, was also arrested for hindering apprehension. The sheriff's office wrote on Facebook: 'Let's put it this way, when the police ask you multiple times if someone is in the house, and you answer repeatedly that they are not in the house, and that you have not seen said person in ''weeks'', you're just going to get arrested.

But his views on the Terry controversy, which led to the Chelsea skipper being stripped of the England captaincy, banned for four matches and fined \u00a3220,000, are most damning. QPR director of football Les Ferdinand says that he believes English football remains inherently racist.

Asked by Phillips for his view on the Terry incident, Ferdinand said: \u2018I suppose it was disbelief really, that the England captain would use language like that on a football field, or anywhere in fact.\u2019 But it is when Phillips then asked Ferdinand for his view on \u2018how the game handled it\u2019 that the former England striker put the situation into a wider context.

Weeks before the FA charge, Terry had been cleared of racial abuse at Westminster Magistrates' Court. \u2018Terribly,\u2019 he responded. \u2018I think it\u2019s a situation that could have been put to bed quite quickly. \u2018And when you look at the game and the disproportion of black coaches in the game, maybe they\u2019re not actually saying what John Terry said, but are they thinking it? Because I have to believe that.\u2019 Phillips then asked Ferdinand how many times, in the 10 years since he stopped playing, he had been offered the opportunity to become a first-team coach. The QPR director of football says he has only been offered one first-team coaching job in 10 years. Ferdinand says he knows black players who would like to go into management but don't get opportunities. \u2018Once,\u2019 said Ferdinand. \u2018Yeah once, when I came out of football I spoke to the then chairman of Bournemouth. \u2018I know lots of players that I play with who\u2019d love to go into coaching and management and they\u2019ve done all the badges, but they just won\u2019t get an opportunity. \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about this for 15 years now; the only difference is the venues seem to be getting better.

But it also follows good news for fans of the 35-year-old's explosive and unpredictable batting style. Chris Gayle sings along to a performance of Sam Smith's Stay With Me at Sydney's Opera Bar. Gayle poses with a female police officer in Sydney as he takes a break in the city he calls 'Paradise' Gayle posted 'It was fun while it lasted. #CWC15' as he relaxed on a boat after his side's World Cup exit. 'Definitely want to play the T20 World Cup next year for West Indies, there's no doubt about that,' Gayle told ESPNcricinfo. 'I've got a few concerns and a few injuries to try and solve. I'll give myself some time and hopefully look back at it and see how well I can actually progress for West Indies cricket at this point in time.' 'I'm actually out of the Test series, the back won't hold up for that format at this point in time, but I haven't retired from any format as yet.' And why would Gayle retire if he's enjoying life both on and off the field. Gayle, 35, told ESPNcricinfo that he has no intention to retire from any form of cricket yet. Gayle hit a 33-ball 61 in the West Indies 143-run defeat by New Zealand in their World Cup quarter-final. The destructive opening batsman thanks the crowd in Wellington after his side bowed out of the Cup. Also on Sunday Gayle, who plays in the Big Bash League for the Sydney Thunder, posted happy snaps with a female police officer and of himself relaxing on a boat, along with an image on Twitter of a meal he was enjoying 'Back in paradise #Sydney' with the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background. Gayle headed to Sydney after the West Indies were dumped out of the World Cup by an impressive New Zealand outfit on Saturday as his shortlived World Cup record of 215 was broken by Martin Guptill's remarkable 237. He smashed a 33-ball 61 in the Windies' unlikely chase but it was nowhere near enough as they lost the quarter-final by 143 runs. Gayle poses with Martin Guptill after the New Zealander smashed his World Cup record innings. Gayle hit 215 against Zimbabwe in Canberra on February 24 but Guptill's 237 on Saturday trumped him. Gayle posed for photos with Guptill after the match and was far from downbeat as he thanked West Indies supporters. 'It was fun while it lasted #CWC15,' he wrote on Instagram. However, they won't see him for a while as a recurring back injury keeps him out of the three-match Test series against England starting next month. Gayle has played 103 Tests and 269 ODIs, and was instrumental in the West Indies' 2012 T20 triumph, a performance he's keen to replicate before hanging up his bat."}

Students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities, but these have been curbed because of the crackdown. The violence Tuesday occurred in Letpadan, a town of about 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of Yangon, the nation's largest city. The students' march began in Mandalay, about 640 kilometers (400 miles) north of Yangon. Zarni said the students had been \"given the red light\" on proceeding to Yangon. \"They had decided they would drive into the city, meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse,\" Zarni said. \"But within about an hour of being given this information, they were told that wasn't the case.\" \"Some students decided they would try, thinking the police would just take them away, but the police were so brutal.\" Police arrested about 40 to 50 people, according to Zarni. \"They broke a reporter's camera and cheered about it. They hit women. They hit monks who were also there. They went into the monastery and detained everyone who had run to hide in there,\" Zarni said. Human rights issues have been at the forefront in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule, with elections planned for late this year. \"The public and we are losing confidence in the democratic transitions,\" Zarni said. Khin Lay, director of the Triangle Women Support Group, agreed. \"Students, human rights, women's rights -- we're all extremely angry about the way we have been treated over the years,\" said Lay. \"But we've been waiting for the 2015 elections with patience because we believe in the democracy movement, and we're hoping that we have the opportunity to exercise our right to vote.

The 21-year-old, a Holland international, attracted interest after impressing at the World Cup in Brazil, with Tottenham even tabling a \u20ac20million (\u00a314.6m) bid for the forward, which was turned down. But PSV director Toon Gerbrands is resigned to the fact that he is likely to leave when the next transfer window opens in June. Memphis Depay (right), in action on Sunday night against Ajax, is attracting interest from the Premier League. The 21-year-old forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances for PSV Eindhoven so far this season. Louis van Gaal is interested in the player, who he called up to the Holland squad for the World Cup in Brazil. 'Tottenham were willing to offer \u20ac20m for Depay,' he told Dutch broadcaster NOS. 'We decided to keep hold of him, but he has the option to leave after this season.' Depay and PSV colleague Georginio Wijnaldum are expected to attract a number of high-profile suitors, with the latter being eyed up by Paris Saint-Germain. 'I think these two players are very attractive to a lot of clubs in Europe,' Gerbrands continued. 'So far, no-one has come forward with an offer but I expect we will come under great pressure.' Depay (left) celebrates with international team-mate Arjen Robben during Holland's game with Chile in 2014. Depay turned down a move to Tottenham last summer, but could leave for England in the next window. Depay is familiar with current Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal due to their time spent together with Holland, and reports in the summer stated that the player's decision to stay with PSV was heavily influenced by Van Gaal. Therefore, Depay's decision on which club to choose if he does leave PSV may be swayed by Van Gaal and Manchester United, who also have Depay's international team-mate Daley Blind in their ranks. The forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season."}

And with Australia overhauling the New Zealanders\u2019 disappointing total of 183 with seven wickets and nearly 17 overs to spare, he went out in style, watched by an MCG crowd of 93,013 \u2013 an official world record for a single day\u2019s cricket. Michael Clarke kisses the World Cup after guiding his team to glory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Referring to the black armband he wore in memory of Hughes, who died in November after being struck on the neck by a short-pitched delivery during a domestic game in Sydney, Clarke said: \u2018As you can see it's got PH on it. I\u2019ll wear it every game I play for Australia. For everyone in Australian cricket it\u2019s been a tough few months. \u2018We played this World Cup with 16 players and this is certainly dedicated to our little brother and team-mate Phillip Hughes. Hughesy used to party as good as any of them, so I\u2019ll make sure we drink two at a time \u2013 one for Hughesy and one for us. 'Hughes used to party as good as any of them so I'll make sure we drink two (beers) at a time tonight, one for Hughesy and one for us.'

The one-way traffic was held up only during a gutsy fourth-wicket stand of 111 between Ross Taylor and Grant Elliott, New Zealand\u2019s hero during their semi-final thriller against South Africa. But James Faulkner, named man of the match for figures of 3 for 36, removed Taylor and the big-hitting Corey Anderson in the first over of the batting powerplay, and wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi fell in the next, to the outstanding Starc. Elliott went on to make 83, but New Zealand\u2019s last seven fell for just 33 in 10 overs. After eight successive games on their smaller, less intimidating, home grounds, they never came to terms with either the occasion or the relentlessness of the Australian attack. The dismissal of Martin Guptill, who had hammered West Indies for an unbeaten 237 from 163 balls in the quarter-finals, summed up their day: trying to dab a gentle off-break from Glenn Maxwell through backward point, he was bowled for 15. Australia lost Aaron Finch to Trent Boult in the second over of the reply, but for New Zealand\u2019s bowlers that was as good as it got. David Warner hit 45 in 46 balls, before Clarke joined Steve Smith \u2013 his heir apparent \u2013 to add 112. After carting Tim Southee for four successive fours, Clarke chopped on against Matt Henry with nine runs still needed, but Smith was there at the end, a fifth successive half-century in his increasingly irresistible bag. Clarke received a standing ovation as he left the field having been dismissed in his final one-day international.

The rally, called \"Israel Wants Change,\" was put on by One Million Hands, a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues: a two-state solution and a reduction in the cost of living. On both of these topics, founder Dror Ben-Ami says, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed. \"We think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office. To get Bibi out of office,\" says Ben-Ami. Organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the March 17 balloting. Instead, they are encouraging voters to change the current administration. Police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people. Headlining the rally was Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and a vocal critic of Netanyahu. In recent weeks, Dagan criticized Netanyahu's decision to speak before the U.S. Congress, and he continued his criticism at the rally, saying that he has never seen such stagnation in Israeli politics. Netanyahu still has broad support in Israel, and his Likud party is doing well in the polls. The Zionist Union is Likud's primary challenger. In the initial round of polling immediately following Netanyahu's speech before Congress, the Zionist Union was expected to win 24 seats in the Knesset while Likud was expected to win 23 seats. The poll comes from CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel. Because of the nature of Israeli politics, Netanyahu's Likud party could lose the election while Netanyahu still becomes prime minister. In many ways, this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011. Hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of Tel Aviv, demanding improvements in the cost of housing, education, and health care. What started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities. This time, the issues are different. But the growing sense of discontent and the calls for change remain."}

'I almost cried watching Messi against Man City. He's so good! But anyway, I get emotional very easily. But hey, I get excited easily and not only with the major teams.

Herrera also made reference in the interview to the recent scandal involving United captain Rooney, who was videoed boxing in his house with former team-mate Phil Bardsley. Herrera was asked about the sense of humour in the dressing room, and said it is better with Spanish players. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney insults the Spaniards in their own language, according to Herrera. 'The jokes here are different,' said Herrera. 'Rooney is outgoing and insults us in Spanish. I'd rather talk to him about football because he likes boxing and could try it with me.' However, he was also clear that respect for Rooney is high, insisting that 'I just listen to Rooney and Carrick before games'. 'There is a lot of respect for Rooney and Carrick,who spent many years here, because you see that it is very difficult to do. 'But David De Gea says the dressing room used to be more hierarchic with Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.' Herrera says Michael Carrick is one of the main leaders in the Manchester United dressing room. The Manchester United star, who played a beautiful pass to Juan Mata for his side's first goal on Sunday at Anfield, also praised English football for the patience of its fans, and the high standard of refereeing. 'The Premier League is the best place to succeed because people are patient. In Spain there's more stir around you from press or fans. 'There's a lot of respect for referees in England. Now I thank (former Athletic Bilbao manager Marcelo) Bielsa for telling me referees are a helpful instrument for football.'

A honeytrap mother-of-one lured a lonely man to her flat with promises of a drunken romp before two thugs burst in and demanded cash. Kelly Percival, 32, lured a 43-year-old to her flat for a'sexual encounter' in April last year, but once he was inside he was set upon by a man and woman who said: 'Give me \u00a3100 or I will cut you up.' Despite being punched several times in the head, he managed to escape, before calling the police who arrested Ms Percival. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks told the court Pervical had started chatting to the victim over dating site Badoo, using the name 'Jess' on her profile. Mr Perks said: 'This culminated in the complainant being invited to visit 'Jess' for what the victim believed would be effectively a date, a sexual encounter. 'He travelled to the address in a taxi, having bought vodka and cigarettes.' The court heard when the victim arrived at the upstairs flat he was led by Percival, who by then had told him her real name, into the living room. Mr Perks added: 'The complainant sat down on the settee and it was at that point a male and female burst into the room. 'The male immediately said \"give me \u00a3100 or I will cut you up\".' The court heard the victim was also threatened by the female before he tried to get out and realised he was locked in the flat. The male attacker demanded the victim's mobile phone when he saw him trying to contact the police before opening the door to let him out. Mr Perks added: 'He was punched by the male to the head a number of times, which knocked off his glasses.' The victim showed police his dating profile and messages and Pervical. Officers then used this to track her down as she had used pictures of herself as her profile images. Mr Perks said: 'The defendant fully admitted agreeing with the others for the victim to go to her flat and they they would then effectively 'tax' him, get money by force.' The man and woman who threatened the victim escaped, and have never been caught. Percival was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years, with a supervision order. Newcastle Crown Court heard that, despite being repeatedly punched in the head, the man managed to escape from the flat and call police, who arrested Percival. Judge Jeremy Freedman told her: 'He believed you were willing to engage in sexual relations with him on April 6 when he wnet to an address you had given him. 'When he arrived he was confronted by two other people who burst into the room and demanded \u00a3100 and threatened to cut him up. 'Your role was as a facilitator, you lured him to the property, knowing what was to happen. 'There was a plan afoot, it was not sophisticated but you had obviously agreed with the two others that is what you would do in order to rob him of a sum of money. 'I am satisfied, once he had been lured to the flat, you took no further role in the offence. 'Nevertheless, but for your involvement, the robbery could not have and would not have happened.' The judge said the ordeal must have been a 'terrifying' experience for the victim, who has been left traumatised by what happened to him. Vic Laffey, defending, said mum-of-one Percival got involved in the scam to feed her drug habit, which she is now handling. Mr Laffey said: 'Her circumstances, at least for the moment, have taken a turn for the better. She appears to be getting some help and handling the drug problems. She is far better than she was.'"}

Tory Treasury minister David Gauke has warned that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would put people's economic security at risk.", "article": "Labour's flagship economic plan to increase taxes on big business to ease the pressure on the high street could cost 100,000 jobs, David Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister said the proposal to hike corporation tax for the first time in 40 years was 'crazy'. Corporation tax is set to fall from 21p to 20p tomorrow \u2013 but Labour have pledged to reverse the cut to help reduce business rates for millions of smaller firms. Corporation tax is set to fall from 21p to 20p tomorrow \u2013 but in a speech today in Swindon Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged to reverse the cut to help reduce business rates for millions of smaller firms. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he would use the first budget of a Labour government to cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies - worth an average of \u00a3400 to each firm \u2013 and then freeze them the following year. Speaking in Swindon on the first full day of the election campaign this morning, Mr Balls said 17 small firms would benefit from the cut for every one large business helped by the Coalition's reduction in corporation tax. He said: 'It's not right to go ahead with the further cut for larger companies when we can use the money in a better way to help us create more good jobs by backing small companies.' Mr Balls said he would use the first budget of a Labour government to cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies - worth an average of \u00a3400 to each firm \u2013 and then freeze them the following year. Mr Balls said the coalition spent \u00a37 billion over the last five years cutting the main rate of corporation tax to the benefit of larger firms while revenues from business rates rose by \u00a33 billion, at an average cost to firms of \u00a31,500-a-year. Will Straw, the son of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, was out campaigning in Blackburn today. He is standing for Parliament in the Rossendale and Darwen constituency. Mr Balls added: 'Unleashing the potential of smaller businesses to grow, create more good jobs and raise living standards is a vital part of Labour's better plan. 'This is part of our plan to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system for small businesses. This is the right priority when money is tight. And it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with Labour than under the Tories.' However the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised Labour's spending plans. It comes after some company bosses complained at the way comments they had made expressing concern about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU were included in a Labour advertisement attacking the Conservatives. Mr Cameron \u2013 who this morning set out the Conservative pledge to boost employment by two million over the next five years \u2013 told Sky News's Sunrise that Labour's plan to raise corporation tax was 'a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing'. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke said that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would jeopardise economic security. He said: 'This would be the first time corporation tax has risen in over 40 years and Labour's plans could cost 96,400 jobs - it would put people's economic security at risk.

Of the nine teams on display over the three four-day tests these past few weeks, McLaren suffered the ignominy of finishing bottom of the pile in terms of kilometres and laps covered. That was perhaps not too unexpected given the team's switch to Honda power units from this term, with the Japanese manufacturer the new kids on the block and a year behind in development of the complicated system compared to Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault. Jenson Button has called for patience from McLaren fans after a tough winter of pre-season testing. The major surprise was just how few laps McLaren managed overall - just 177, less than half of another surprise team in eighth on the list in Red Bull who chalked up 359. With this weekend's season-opening Australian Grand Prix approaching fast, at present there are doubts as to not only the pace of the McLaren-Honda, but also whether Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen - standing in for Fernando Alonso - will even see the chequered flag. As ever, though, Button's enthusiasm is boundless as he said: 'I'm so excited to be back in Melbourne. 'After the ups and downs of 2014, I feel the challenge of 2015 is a completely new chapter in my career and I'm totally up for it. 'I also love Melbourne. It's a fantastic city with great people and the atmosphere is always buzzing, and Albert Park is the perfect place for the season-opener. 'While we know the city and the circuit well, what is more of an unknown is how we will fare in the MP4-30. Button drives his McLaren car during day two of winter testing in Montmelo last month. 'McLaren-Honda have been working incredibly hard over the winter, and although we would, of course, have liked to cover more miles in Jerez and Barcelona, I can definitely see a difference in the car from the first day to the last. 'The team's commitment to development and improvement, in Woking and in Japan, is astonishing, and despite some tricky days in testing we are seeing definitive progress. 'The car is a solid base which gives me optimism we will get there, we just need patience.' Button appreciates this weekend may be a tough one for all the team, but the 35-year-old will be giving it everything to gain a result. 'Melbourne is always a fascinating spectacle, nobody quite knows where they'll be in comparison to their rivals,' added Button. Button celebrates after winning the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park in March 2012. 'Even though the other teams are in the second year of the turbo era, all of the development from last year has been done very much behind the scenes, so I don't think anyone has quite shown their full hand yet. 'For us, the race at Albert Park will be a huge learning curve, but I'll be working flat-out with my engineers to get the car set up as best we can. 'Together we'll fight right until the last moment to get the most out of the weekend.' The fact there is also no Alonso serves as another blow to the team, with the Spaniard advised by doctors not to compete this weekend in the wake of sustaining concussion from a heavy crash in testing. There are a number of observers who feel not all has been explained as to the reason behind the crash and just why he spent three days in hospital for mild concussion when all tests came back clear. Fernando Alonso waves as he leaves hospital in Sant Cugat, Spain after a crash during testing last month. With Alonso poised to return to the cockpit for the next race later this month in Malaysia, Button said: 'Fernando not being able to race is a real shame. 'I just hope he makes a speedy recovery so that he can get behind the wheel again very soon. 'But it's great to see Kevin back in the car, though, and I know he'll do a great job in Fernando's absence, so I wish him well this weekend.'"}

But for one karate-kicking great-grandmother in Kansas, there is no letting up. Helen Dugan, a third-degree black belt, continues to lead karate classes at the school she set up, Champs Achievers, despite passing the milestone. Battling on: Despite turning 80, Helen Dugan, owner of karate school Champs Achievers, is not letting up. Aiming high: After earning her black belt at 61, Dugan was inspired to teach others the sport in Kansas. Iron fist: Dugan set up the class for disabled children and said it was important to 'build on their strengths' The great-grandmother of 17 only took up the sport when she took two of her children to a class at the age of 47, the Kansas City Star\u00a0reports. She said: 'We never had karate when I was a child, so I took my sons to a class and I realised that my two skinny sons didn't need the exercise and so I got into the back row of the class.' Her children lasted four years before as she puts it, 'they discovered girls and got married', but she 'was hooked'. Dugan, who has been married to husband Barney for 57 years, took karate classes for 14 years, earning her black belt at the age of 61. At the time she was also working as a nurse in the Center School District in Kansas City, in Missouri. Leading the way: Dugan takes a hit from seven-year-old Brayden Bond during a class in Lenexa, Kansas. Listen in: The great-grandmother quiets the class as three-year-old Aiden Degnan tries to get her attention. Friendly face: Dugan has seen her class grow in the last 20 years and it now caters for more than 50 children. Jousting: Dugan takes on five-year-old Micah Jenkins using pugil sticks during one of her sessions. Inspired to pass on her expertise to others, the mother-of-five set up a non-profit karate class called Champs aimed at helping those with a disability. Karate and other martial arts taught at the group - \u00a0including judo, jujitsu, tai chi and a defensive street-fighting discipline called Guided Chaos - can improve concentration, stamina, balance, motor skills, independence and self-esteem. She said: 'I started the group because the class I was learning in had children who couldn't keep up, so I took them aside. Sometimes it was because of learning disabilities, or it was children with ADHD. 'I then started teaching them separately.' Now almost 20 years later, the group is going from strength to strength and caters for more than 50 children in the area."}

The so-called \u2018health tourism gap\u2019 between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost \u00a3700million. It means the UK is now paying out \u00a315 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every \u00a31 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra \u00a3500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18. Both GPs and hospitals will be given incentives to identify non-British users of the NHS and payment procedures will be made easier. However, the latest Department of Health statistics indicate there is a long way to go. Released following a Freedom of Information request, they show that in 2013/14, British taxpayers handed \u00a3749.8million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens abroad. This has risen by \u00a3100million from \u00a3649.3million just a year before. But in the same period, the NHS managed to collect only \u00a350.3million from European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here. This is an increase on the \u00a332million total the year before \u2013 but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way. Ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment. Figures which emerged at the weekend show the NHS is still chasing at least \u00a362million of unpaid bills for foreigners\u2019 care. One London hospital trust alone \u2013 King\u2019s College \u2013 is owed almost \u00a318million from overseas patients. One single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than \u00a3420,000. Others owe more than \u00a3100,000 for treatments including dialysis, bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, according to The Sunday Times. Health minister Dan Poulter was even photographed with a new mother from Zimbabwe who is still being pursued for a \u00a33,000 bill. Two years ago, cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned many foreigners were travelling to Britain for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the \u2018world\u2019s maternity wing\u2019. Last night Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: \u2018We\u2019re fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world. \u2018But we are not the International Health Service, it\u2019s the National Health Service. This is an issue which needs to be addressed.\u2019 Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said: \u2018It is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for EU citizens.\u2019 Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right,\u00a0have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra \u00a3500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18. Part of the gap is due to the fact that so many British pensioners retire to the continent. There may also be more tourists from Britain travelling to mainland Europe than the other way round. But there are more than a million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other European countries. Under EU arrangements, UK citizens can be treated by other nations\u2019 health services and the bill is sent back to Britain. In theory, these European nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the NHS. In 2013/14, the UK paid Ireland \u00a3246million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only \u00a322million came back the other way. Some \u00a3250million was paid to Spain but only \u00a33.2million came back. France received \u00a3152million but returned just \u00a37million. Italy got \u00a36.2million and sent back \u00a31.1million, while Greece collected \u00a38.9million and returned \u00a3400,000. A Department of Health spokesman said: \u2018We want international visitors to feel welcome to use the NHS, provided they pay for it \u2013 just as families in the UK do through their taxes. \u2018Our plans will help recoup up to \u00a3500million a year by 2017/18.\u2019 Jonathan Isaby, chief executive at the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018Emergency medical treatment is one thing, but taxpayers cannot be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer-term treatment for tourists. \u2018Our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors.'

Women with a first degree male relative with prostate cancer and mother or sister with breast cancer were 78 per cent more at risk. The findings suggest that doctors should routinely ask women whether prostate cancer runs in her family when establishing her risk of breast cancer.", "article": "An American study of 78,000 women found that those whose fathers, brothers or sons had prostate cancer were 14 per cent more at risk of breast cancer. Women whose father or brother has prostate cancer are more likely to develop breast cancer, research shows. Scientists believe the illnesses are caused by the same faulty gene passed down through families. An American study of 78,000 women found that those whose fathers, brothers or sons had prostate cancer were 14 per cent more at risk of breast cancer. But women were 80 per cent more likely to get the illness if their father, brother or son had prostate cancer and their mother or sister had breast cancer. The findings \u2013 published in the journal Cancer \u2013 are further evidence that some types of breast and prostate cancer are caused by the same inherited, faulty gene. Although doctors have been aware the illnesses run in families for several years, this research shows the faulty gene may be more important than they previously thought. Its lead author says doctors should routinely ask women whether prostate cancer runs in her family when establishing her risk of breast cancer. Women considered high-risk are offered more frequent x-rays, genetic tests and in some cases, preventative drugs such as Tamoxifen. Breast and prostate cancers are the most common forms of the illness in women and men respectively. There are 50,500 new cases of breast cancer in the UK each year and just under 42,000 of prostate cancer. Dr Jennifer Beebe-Dimmer, of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, studied the records of 78,171 women over a 16-year-period. Those with a first degree male relative \u2013 brother, father or son \u2013 were 14 per cent more likely to have developed the illness. But women with a first degree male relative with prostate cancer and mother or sister with breast cancer were 78 per cent more at risk. Those with a first degree male relative \u2013 brother, father or son \u2013 were 14 per cent more likely to have developed the illness. Dr Beebe-Dimmer said: 'The increase in breast cancer risk associated with having a positive family history of prostate cancer is modest; however, women with a family history of both breast and prostate cancer among first-degree relatives have an almost two-fold increase in risk of breast cancer. 'These findings are important in that they can be used to support an approach by clinicians to collect a complete family history of all cancers - particularly among first degree relatives - in order to assess patient risk for developing cancer. 'Families with clustering of different tumors may be particularly important to study in order to discover new genetic mutations to explain this clustering.' Dr Caitlin Barrand, Senior Policy Manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'Although we've known for some time that there are links between prostate cancer and breast cancer, this study suggests the link might be more important than we previously thought. 'If further research confirms the findings of this study this may further improve our ability to estimate an individual's risk of developing breast cancer, and offer personalised plans to help prevent the disease, or diagnose it early, when it can be more successfully treated. 'We'd recommend that women speak to their GP if they have any concerns about their family history of cancer, and advise that they should be prepared to talk about cancers on both the mother and father's side - the GP should ask about both.'"}
{"abstract": "On Sunday, the remains of Richard III were carried away from the University of Leicester in a solemn ceremony. Thousands of people lined the streets of Leicester and the surrounding towns and villages to witness the procession, which ended with a commemoration at Leicester Cathedral. The day was a special moment for the city, as the bones of the medieval monarch had been discovered beneath a council car parking lot in 2012.", "article": "Leicester, England (CNN)\"God save King Richard!\" A cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of Richard III is carried away from the tower block-filled campus of the University of Leicester for the final time. The medieval monarch's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in August 2012. But on Sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became, once more, the mortal remains of a king. Some 35,000 people lined the streets of Leicester and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of Richard's final battle, Bosworth, where he died in 1485, before returning to the city for a commemoration at Leicester Cathedral. The day began on the freshly-mown lawns in front of the university's Fielding Johnson Building, where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell, dignitaries dressed in their Sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a March shower. Leicester University student Anna Boyer, from North Carolina, said she and her classmates had come to watch the ceremony \"so I can say I was here,\" adding: \"It's an important historical event -- we don't have things like this in the States.\" Leicester alumni Sara and Leeroy Paskell brought their daughters Saoirse, 6, and Orlaith, 9, to watch the cortege pass by. \"We thought it would be nice for the children to see it,\" said Sara Paskell. \"It is amazing to be part of history, it makes me really proud of the university and of Leicester.\" That pride is something which those who helped in the search for Richard III share. Leicester University's president and vice-chancellor Paul Boyle said the discovery of the bones had been a \"defining moment\" which \"reshaped history,\" and pointed out that the university had been custodian of Richard III's remains for longer than he ruled England. Genetics expert Turi King, who proved the identity of the bones by matching their DNA to a living relative of the monarch, Michael Ibsen, said: \"It has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved.\" King, who read Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken\" at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of Richard's heritage as a member of the House of York -- on the coffin, said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story, but not the end of the story itself; she is still working to sequence his entire genome. Michael Ibsen and another living relative of Richard III, Wendy Duldig, were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber grey-brown bricks of the Fielding Johnson Building; accompanied by archaeologist Richard Buckley, who led the dig which uncovered the King's bones, they walked silently behind as the cortege's journey began. Thousands of people lined the route of the procession, out through the Leicestershire villages visited by Richard III on his way to the Battle of Bosworth. Perched on fold-up picnic chairs they gathered on roadside verges, along pavements decorated with bunting, flags and paper chains of white Yorkist roses, and in pub car parks to be entertained by folk dancers as they waited for the coffin to pass by. At Fenn Lane Farm, thought to be the closest location to the spot where Richard III died, earth from three key points in his life was placed in a casket carved with his symbol, a boar. The casket, and the procession, then made their way to Bosworth, where they were greeted by men dressed in medieval armor. Here, Richard's role as a \"warrior king\" was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him. A beacon, which will burn until he is laid to rest on Thursday, was lit on the battlefield. Back in Leicester, thousands more gathered around the cathedral and in nearby Jubilee Square. Waiting to go in to the service, Judy Ellis, from the nearby town of Hinckley, said there was a \"real buzz\" around the city. \"It's quite exciting, coming over on the train I met people who'd come from all over the world to be in Leicester today.\" Ellis, who named her son Richard, said she had used the parking lot where the king's remains were found. \"Four days before the dig started I parked my car over that grave!\" she said. Adults -- some carrying single white roses and others wearing boar badges -- in village churches along the route watched the services play out on a big screen as children ran around in the late afternoon sunshine while they waited for Richard's return.

At one point, video shows her standing with her face covered in blood. She is pushed and falls over, and her beating continues with feet, with rocks, with boards. Then, in the last part of the video, her body is engulfed in flames -- though it's not known whether, by that point, she was already dead. This horrific scene played out in Kabul on Thursday. It's already had ripple effects, including a United Nations statement on Friday condemning what it called \"the brutal killing and burning of a 27-year-old mentally ill woman.\" That corresponds with what the woman's parents told CNN affiliate Tolo News, saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years. It's not known whether her attackers knew this, or that it would have mattered. What motivated the mob, according to witnesses, was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the Quran. CNN hasn't seen any proof that she set a copy ablaze. Afghanistan's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs has found no such evidence, either, according to Tolo. Mark Bowden, acting head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission, said that burning the Quran hurts efforts to promote \"understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions.\" \"However, the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act,\" Bowden said, \"that should result in those responsible being prosecuted, to the fullest extent possible, under Afghan law.\" Nahid, a 45-year-old woman who goes only by one name, told CNN what she saw and heard outside the Shah Do Shamshera shrine, which is opposite a mosque by the same name. A group of women were shouting at the eventual victim, accusing her of burning the Quran, according to Nahid. The woman yelled back. This got the attention of men nearby. Police tried to close gates to keep them out but it didn't work, said the witness, noting that many men jumped a fence and began beating the accused woman. The hits and kicks ended after someone poured fuel on the woman and lit her on fire, said Nahid, who watched from inside the shrine. \"(They) burned her and then threw her corpse away in the Kabul River,\" she said. As of Saturday, 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman's death, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. Seddiqi said that the investigation is ongoing. President Ashraf Ghani ordered two investigations related to the case -- one into the beating itself and another including religious scholars. His government is \"committed to protecting and safeguarding all Islamic values,\" including prohibitions on burning the Quran (if that is, indeed, what this woman did). That's a responsibility of the nation's security and legal system, Ghani said, not of individual Afghans. \"No individual is allowed to make oneself a judge and use violence to punish others in degrading manners,\" the President said. \"Launching personal trials and choosing who to punish stands in clear contradiction to Sharia and Islamic justice.\" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta."}

POWER: During a July 2014 broadcast interview with NBC, Jarrett showed off her office \u2013 including a picture frame decorated with figurines bowing to her. OBAMA-WHISPERER: Jarrett is the president's closest adviser but has never faced an election or a Senate confirmation vote. The New York Times Magazine interviewed Jarrett for a feature published on Friday, hearing her say that her relationship to Obama is nothing like the famously cozy one between former President George W. Bush and Vice Presdient Dick Cheney. 'Please don't say that. Stop right there,' she insisted. 'The president listens to people who have interesting things to say \u2013 that could be the most junior person on the staff or it could be a senior adviser or it could be a person who whispers something to him across a rope line.' There's nothing new about close advisers in the White House, not even with the spacious West Wing office Jarrett has occupied since 2009. George W. Bush had\u00a0Karen Hughes. Bill Clinton had Bruce Lindsey. Ronald Reagan had Michael Deaver. Thomas Jefferson had James Madison. 'NIGHT-STALKER': Jarrett has access to both the West Wing and the upstairs presidential residence, drawing resentment from other senior staff. But a Republican congressional staffer who requested anonymity spoke frankly about Jarrett on Friday, telling Daily Mail Online that she 'is clearly Obama's Rasputin, subtlely steering the ship of state.' 'Valerie Jarrett has the kind of influence on the federal government that the Constitution was designed to prevent,' the staffer said. The New Republic once reported on quiet discussions with an unnamed former Obama administration official who explained aides' resentment of her all-hours access status with the first family \u2013 a situation that has earned her the nickname 'the night stalker.' 'It\u2019s pretty toxic,' the official said. 'She went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to \u2013 basically all of them \u2013 and then would go and whisper to the president. Or at least everyone believed she did.... People don\u2019t trust the process. They think she\u2019s a spy.' Jarrett told the Times that having Obama's ear and knowing his instincts 'initially it probably made people a little uncomfortable,' but 'I think that has faded. I just want to do my job, and part of my job for the president is to be his friend.' 'WHATEVER MEETING SHE WANTED': Jarrett reportedly has carte blanche to sit in with Obama wherever and whenever she chooses \u2013 including this February 2014 sit-down with business leaders where she sat closer to the president than former secretary of state Colin Powell. 'RASTPUTIN': A Republican congressional aide likened Jarrett to Grigori Rasputin, the mystical Russian faith healer who earned the nickname'mad monk' as he wielded influence over Tsar Nicholas II and his wife. What hasn't faded is the Washington-wide perception that she has outsize influence. Recent books and White House interviews have fed that fire more oxygen. In his book 'Leading From Behind,' noted terrorism expert and multiple New York Times best-selling author Richard Miniter\u00a0reported that the president called off \u2013 three times \u2013 a planned the Navy SEAL raid that killed al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden. It was Jarrett who persuaded him to step back each time, according to Miniter's sources. The White House later denied his account. And Ed Klein, whose book 'Blood Feud' traced the arc of a decade-long rivalry between the Obamas and the Clintons, said Wednesday on the Fox News Channel that the White House \u2013 not scheming Republicans \u2013 is behind the swirling scandal over Hillary Clinton's secret email server. Klein cited sources who told him Jarrett and Obama are jointly behind it since neither wants sto see Mrs. Clinton measuring the Oval Office's drapes. White House staffers, he told Fox News, are seeing 'tons of documents being wheeled through the corridors from Clinton\u2019s old offices, and they\u2019re going through these looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders.' 'All of this, I\u2019m told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton president of the United States,' Klein said. EXCUSE?

Scroll down for video. What used to be grassy fields is now just barren ground after the grasshopper infestation. The grasshoppers are in their hundreds of thousands 7News reported. They are finally moving on but they have laid eggs and left devastation behind. The locusts have destroyed any greenery they can find, chewing up the leaves and lawns, and stripping trees bare. 'It's at plague proportions here,' another local said. Although some insects thrive in moist conditions, heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers. They are the most most common insects that cause problems during periods of heat and drought. The Australian Plague Locust Commission told ABC News it has been monitoring the situation, but there was no plague. All that's left on the tree is the fruits as the grasshoppers ate all the foliage. \u2018What we have got is some areas where there is a localised, high-density infestation,' spokesman Chris Adriaansen said. \u2018But the extent of the infestation certainly does not qualify the current population levels to plague proportions. \u2018We have been watching that population very closely, obviously. We have our own field staff based at Longreach and they are very aware of what is in that area.' Heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers. Even if the grasshoppers are about to move on they still have left a calling card that could prove disastrous in the future. \u2018What we will see now is that those adults that are still in condition to do so will lay some eggs,\" he said. \u2018We would expect that within the next two to four weeks we would start to see the third generation of nymphs coming out of the ground. \u2018That generation and the extent and the density of that generation will determine what if any control is implemented.' Another worry are Kangeroos looking for food with groups of 25-30 coming in groups in and around the town. Until the grasshopper infestation it was the Flying Kangeroo that Longreach was famous for after one of the founding centres for Qantas, the Australian domestic and international airline. One of the airline's original hangars remains in use at the Longreach Airport and is listed on the Australian National Heritage List. The town is now the home of the Qantas Founders Outback Museum.

The father of missing Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Collins took out a $30,000 life insurance in his son's name before the boy vanished nearly two weeks ago, it emerged today. Barway Collins 10, was last seen after school March 18 near his apartment complex in Crystal. Police said they were working to find the boy and were checking flights to see whether he might have been sent overseas to his mother, believed to be in Liberia. Last week, Police Chief Stephanie Revering named Barway's father, Pierre Collins, a suspect in the child's disappearance, saying the man who was seen weeping at a vigil has not been entirely honest with investigators. Mr Collins has stopped talking to the press about his son's suspected abduction amid mounting suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in the case. Fox 9 reported Tuesday that according to sources, Mr Collins, 33, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. Police said the father failed a lie-detector test  last week, but he has not been arrested or charged with any crime as of Tuesday morning. Pastor Harding Smith, who has been acting as the family's spokesperson, said Collins has told him he had nothing to do with his son's abduction. In a recent interview with CNN's Nancy Grace, Collins said he last saw Barway as he was getting ready for school on the morning of March 18. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway\u2019s father has not been completely truthful with us': Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering, right, releases a videoshowing 10-year-old Barway Collinson a school bus prior to his disappearance. Grilled: Pierre Collins, accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last week, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional. Police have released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an \u2018uncle\u2019 are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway\u2019s father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. 'There's my dad': The footage in question \u00a0(pictured) also has audio and, police say, as the bus pulled up to Barway's building he pointed out his father and an uncle. Previously, police had been searching for anyone who might have seen Barway at that point, the moment of his disappearance. Emotional? Barway Collins' father, Pierre Collins, wipes away tears as he stands with his wife, Yamah, and supporters at vigil Monday for their missing son. Police say Pierre failed a lie-detector test and is not sharing everything he knows. Over the past 13 days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses. Officials are now focusing their search efforts along the Mississippi River south of Interstate 694, where Pierre Collins was spotted walking in a park after his son went missing. A $12,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible for Barway Collins' disappearance. According to the Crystal Police Department, a man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school. So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case. Missing? Massive billboards have sprung up to help in the search for Barway, but now police have started to wonder just how missing he truly is.

Allen hopes his discovery will bring closure to those who lost relatives aboard the ship.", "article": "Microsoft's co-founder has used his own submarine to find the wreck of the Japanese Navy's biggest warship - which has lain undiscovered at the bottom of the ocean for the past 70 years. Paul Allen revealed his amazing discovery to the world on Tuesday, by posting a photo to Twitter of the World War II battleship Musashi's rusty bow, which bore the Japanese empire's Chrysanthemum seal. The Musashi - which, along with its sister ship Yamato, was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed - was sunk by the U.S. Navy in 1944, taking with it more than 1,000 crew members. But despite numerous eyewitness accounts, its exact location had remained a mystery - until now. Scroll down for video. Final resting place: The ship has lain undisturbed at the bottom of the\u00a0Sibuyan Sea since 1944. Pictured: A wheel on a valve which would have been in one of the engine rooms. Explorer: Allen was able to find the ship using\u00a0he M/Y Octopus. Pictured: One of the ship's 15 tonne anchors. Biggest: The\u00a0Musashi was the Japanese Navy's biggest battleship during the Second World War. The discovery brings to an end Allen's eight year search for the Musashi - and is a discovery he hopes will 'bring closure' to those who lost relatives aboard the ship, according to his website. Billionaire Allen said the M/Y Octopus, his luxury yacht and exploration ship, found the long-lost ship on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea - 1.6 miles under the surface. The Octopus' remote operated probe Octo ROV located the Musashi on Monday, according to Allen's website. The Octopus is also outfitted with an exploration submarine. Allen and his research team had used the historical records of four different countries in order to pinpoint the location of the ship. On Tuesday, \u00a0Allen posted a photo of a valve from the wreckage, which he described as the 'first confirmation' that it was of Japanese origin. 'RIP (rest in peace) crew of Musashi, approximately 1,023 (lives) lost,' Allen said in another tweet. He said on Twitter he would soon post video of the ship's catapult and valve areas. Found: Paul Allen took to Twitter to reveal he had found the wreck of the\u00a0Musashi, sunk in 1944. War: American warplanes sank the Musashi on October 24, 1944, at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Record breaking: The Musashi was the largest armed battleship to ever be made. Pictured: A 'float plane' Submerged: Allen and his team believe this to be an inverted type 89, 12.7 centimeter gun turret. Under fire: It was considered the largest naval encounter of World War II. Pictured: The Musashi being attack. Battle: The Musashi was sunk on the second day of fighting between the two sides. The Sibuyan Sea - at the heart of the Philippines' central Visayas islands - now\u00a0covers busy shipping lanes and lies on the path of most tropical storms that cross the country from the Pacific Ocean. But in 1944, it was the scene for a battle considered the largest naval encounter of the Second World War - a battle which would be the Musashi's last. The battleship, which weighed 73,000 tons fully loaded, and was armed with nine 45 Caliber Type 94 main guns, was sunk by American warplanes on October 24, 1944, at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf - in which US and Australian forces defeated the Japanese. About half the crew died when it went down. Sister ship the Yamato was damaged in the fighting, according to the U.S. Navy, and American warships finally sank it a year later as it attempted to reach Okinawa. Discoveries: The American billionaire (pictured) has also pursued space exploration. For Seattle-born Allen, 62, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, the discovery of the Musashi is a thrilling moment. 'Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father\u2019s service in the U.S. Army,'  Allen said. 'The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. 'I am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her.' Allen, the 51st richest person in the world with a net worth of $17.5billion, according to Forbes Magazine, is known for his love of history - and also his generosity with the Octopus to help other exploration missions.

A mother-of-two set fire to the home she was being evicted from in a bid to kill\u00a0herself and her two young children after hearing voices. Aimee Griffiths, 30, of Ruabon, Wrexham, told her two children to lie down and go to sleep as she started the blaze. But her 10-year-old daughter ran out of the house as\u00a0the fire began to spread and raised the alarm. Heroically her neighbours - both in their sixties - were able to get\u00a0Griffiths and her seven-year-old son out of the burning house despite Griffiths fighting to stay inside with the boy. She was 'grabbed by the scruff of her neck' and dragged out - and even then\u00a0tried to get back in. Griffiths has now been jailed for five years and\u00a0four months at Mold Crown Court after she admitted arson. Judge David Hale told her that what she did in the early hours of August 27\u00a0last year 'defied belief'. 'You were clearly intent on killing yourself and your two little children,'\u00a0he said. 'You were on that day, without doubt, in mental turmoil.' The court heard she had been threatened with eviction and was not in a position to cope\u00a0with a number of other pressures. The judge said:\u00a0'The fact\u00a0remains that you intended to kill your children and yourself by setting\u00a0fire to the house. 'If it were not for the tenacity of your daughter, determined to live, you\u00a0may well have succeeded.' Judge Hale went on to praise the 'heroic intervention' of neighbours\u00a0William and Eileen Bride. 'They are entitled to a most remarkable thanks from the community for what\u00a0they did,' he said. The judge said that while on remand at Styal Prison in\u00a0Cheshire Griffiths had made'remarkable progress which was all credit to\u00a0her'. The court heard Griffiths and her family had spent the previous\u00a0afternoon playing bowls with her sister and friends. Griffiths set fire to the house with her family inside shortly after being told she was facing eviction. But she ended up fighting with her sister while drinking wine before buying another bottle\u00a0to drink at home which culminated in her starting a number of fires in the early hours of the morning. John Philpotts, prosecuting, said Griffiths told the children to\u00a0lie on the sofa and that 'everything would be all right'. But her brave daughter refused and ran out of the house to the house\u00a0next door, the home of Mr and Mrs Bride. Mrs Bride, 62, tried to get into the house and shouted to Griffiths to come\u00a0out, but Griffiths refused and demanded her daughter go back in. Mr Bride, 66, got into the burning house through the back door, braving\u00a0thick black smoke to find Griffiths holding her son. The court heard she shouted at him to 'leave my kids alone' but he was able to grab the child\u00a0and pulled her out of the house by the scruff of her neck. Judge Hale praised the 'heroic intervention' of neighbours William and Eileen Bride (pictured) Once outside, Griffiths had to be restrained from getting back in. The blaze caused \u00a350,000 of damage to the semi-detached property. The court heard that a week earlier Griffiths had been referred to the\u00a0psychiatric ward at Wrexham Maelor Hospital.

The same when West Ham United met Millwall in the Carling Cup in 2009. No escape. Administrators must have winced, but that was the hand they had been dealt. No doubt there were similar misgivings at UEFA when Serbia were paired with Albania in the 2016 European Championship qualifiers. Whoever arranged for England to meet the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7, however, is a numpty. Fans invaded the pitch at Villa Park after Aston Villa beat West Brom in the FA Cup. The last time England played Ireland in Dublin in 1995 the game was abandoned due to crowd trouble. The game in 1995 was marred by crowd violence and was called off after 22 minutes. The two sides met at Wembley for a friendly in 2013 when they played out a 1-1 draw. After intense negotiations with police, the kick-off time has now been brought forward to 1pm. Why is it being played at all? There are 209 member associations of FIFA, which means there are 207 countries that England could play without fear of significant disturbance, and one where England\u2019s last visit was abandoned due to a riot. If a free draw sends England back to Dublin, both sides will have to handle it \u2014 but this is an unnecessary risk, and not worth taking. If it ends in tears, and tear gas, again, those who came up with this incendiary fixture should not look far for the blame."}
{"abstract": "Serena Williams returned to Indian Wells, California after 14 years of absence due to the racial abuse she and her family experienced in 2001. She was welcomed with cheers and tears, and felt that just being there was a huge win. Williams is still competing in the tournament, but feels like she has already won due to the warm reception she received.", "article": "(CNN)Serena Williams has won 19 grand slam singles tennis titles, including six U.S. Opens and five Wimbledons. She has four Olympic gold medals. For years, she's had a reputation as one of her sport's top players. Yet for all her myriad accomplishments, Williams says one of her \"biggest... and proudest moments\" came Friday night -- in the second round of a tournament in Indian Wells, California. It's not who she was playing, but where. The Indian Wells Tennis Garden is where Williams was booed during the 2001 finale. Her older sister, Venus, got similar treatment in the stands, and her father Richard told USA Today he was subjected to racial abuse. Afterward, Serena Williams vowed she'd never go back. She kept true to that promise for 14 years, a time when she often dominated her sport. On Friday, Williams was back. And instead of jeers, there were cheers. And tears, shed by Williams during the crowd's loud, boisterous, more than minute-long ovation. \"I knew that I really wanted to do it,\" Williams said afterward of her return to Indian Wells. \"But up until that moment, I didn't really know if it was the right thing for me to do. \"And I feel like that's when I felt it was the right thing,\" she said of her welcome. \"... Receiving the love from the crowd here, it really meant a lot to me.\" The BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, just east of Palm Desert, California, isn't a grand slam but is one of the top tournaments in tennis. As such, top players go there to battle the best and prove their mettle. That's what brought Serena Williams to Indian Wells in 2001. The then-19-year-old got to the finals after her scheduled semifinal foe -- sister Venus -- pulled out minutes before the matching, citing a knee injury. Amid whispers he'd predetermined the outcome, Richard Williams told USA Today that he \"had trouble holding back tears\" given the treatment he got in the stands. According to him, one man said, \"I wish it was '75, we'd skin you alive.\" (Charlie Pasarell, the tournament director at the time, denied any racial abuse in the same story; CNN didn't hear back from him after requesting an interview.) Serena Williams scored a three-set win over Kim Clijsters. But she didn't celebrate. She spent hours crying in the locker room. \"(I drove) back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality,\" Serena Williams wrote in TIME magazine in February. \"Emotionally it seemed easier to stay away.\" Serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at Indian Wells. The roller-coaster ride back to Indian Wells started when Williams accepted a wild-card invitation to play in this year's tournament, a difficult decision she recounted in TIME. Her father and sister, Venus, still stayed away. While she's been on her sport's biggest stage for well over a decade, the world's No. 1-ranked played admitted being nervous in the weeks, days and hours leading to her opening match. Those feelings broke out in the open as she walked onto the court, a response she called \"overwhelming\" and said she \"wasn't really prepared for.\" The match itself wasn't easy, either. Romanian-born Monica Niculescu, the world's 68th-ranked player, challenged her for more than two hours. Still, Williams managed to overcome her competitor and her emotions to win in straight sets, 7-5, 7-5. Declining to reflect on the past, Williams simply said afterward, \"Today was a wonderful day for me, for women's tennis,... for tennis in general, and for everyone.\" The 33-year-old still has a lot of matches ahead of her. That includes more at Indian Wells, whose talented field includes Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki. Still, for all her competitive fire, Williams isn't feeling much pressure to win. She feels like she has already won. \"I don't feel like I actually have to hold the trophy at the end of this,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm already holding the trophy. And I've never felt this way. 'I feel like just being here is a huge win, not only for me but for so many people. And it's a wonderful feeling.\" CNN's Ravi Ubha contributed to this report."}

Brook takes on Canada-based Romanian Jo Jo Dan in a bout which bears all the hallmarks of a triumphant homecoming before the 28-year-old sets his sights on much more lucrative 147lbs assignments. Brook had himself been considered a convenient underdog when he went to California in August and surprised the incumbent champion Shawn Porter to wrest the belt by split decision. Kell Brook (left) poses alongside Jo Jo Dan ahead of their IBF welterweight title fight in Sheffield. Promoter Eddie Hearn sits in between Brook and Dan as they discuss Saturday evening's fight. Brook will not make the mistake of underestimating Dan, according to his trainer Dominic Ingle. And his extraordinary recovery following a life-threatening stabbing while on holiday in Tenerife last September has left Brook in no mood to make assumptions about how his first bout in his home city since October 2013 is going to end. Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle said: 'Shawn Porter under-estimated Kell Brook and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him. 'There is no danger of Kell overlooking Jo Jo in the same way. Jo Jo has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title. Kell is looking for big fights ahead but Jo Jo sees no reason why he shouldn't get them too.' Brook's long recovery since the horrific and unprovoked stabbing incident has left Ingle convinced he will step into the ring on Saturday in the shape of his life - even if his long slog to super-fitness did come at a price. Brook and Dan stare each other out as they go face-to-face in front of the media on Thursday afternoon. Hearn poses alongside Brook and Dan as the champion proudly shows off his IBF welterweight belt. Brook will make the first defence of his title in Sheffield after recovering from being stabbed in the leg last year. 'It's been a long camp and it's sometimes been boring and a bit like groundhog day but he's done all the work and the result is that his fitness is through the roof,' added Ingle. 'Because of the injury he has mentally over-compensated and he has really had to kick up a gear to get himself fit. It has been 30 weeks since he started rehab but he is fitter now than he was for the Porter fight. 'He is fighting on his home ground on Saturday and that will improve his performance by another 10 or 20 per cent. But the fact Jo Jo has come over to take his title will raise his game as well.'"}
{"abstract": "Ikea is producing 10,000 flat-pack shelters for the UNHCR to provide temporary homes for refugees. The shelters are easy to assemble, feature solar panels for electricity, and are twice as large as the current tents used by the UN. The shelters are designed to withstand harsh climates and provide more physical security and dignity for its occupants.", "article": "Swedish furniture giant Ikea will produce 10,000 flat-pack shelters for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) as temporary homes for refugees across the world. The 'Better Shelter' units are to be rolled out on a mass scale following a successful trial in Ethiopia and the borders of Syria, in 2013. It is hoped the flat-pack homes, which can built in four hours without the need for tools,\u00a0will make desperate conditions more bearable for displaced families. Scroll down for video. Family shelter: The shelters here, pictured here at the Syrian refuge in Kawergosk, Northern Iraq, are soon to be delivered on a wider scale. Home comforts:\u00a0: IKEA has developed its own version of refugee shelters, featuring solar panels for electricity and proper standing room inside. The first mass delivery will head to camps across Iraq where 2.5 million people have been displaced by conflict. In typical Ikea fashion, the walls, roof, floors, door and windows all come flat packed in cardboard boxes, making them easy to transport. Dwellers will be pleased the 17.5sqm shelters are twice as large as the current crop of refugee tents used by the UN and can accommodate five or six people. Shaun Scales, chief of shelter and settlement at the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, said they would improve the lives of tens of thousands of people. 'The refugee housing unit is an exciting new development in humanitarian shelter and represents a much needed addition to the palette of sheltering options mobilized to assist those in need,' he said. Successful pilot: The flat-pack shelters, pictured here in Ethiopia as part of a pilot, take four-hours to erect and do not need tools. Refuge: A displaced family stand by a shelter at the Kawergosk refugee camp in northern Iraq. 'Its deployment will ensure dramatic improvement to the lives of many people affected by crises.' Refugee camps are typically overcrowded with temperatures in tents fluctuating between sweltering hot in the day time and freezing at night. The walls and roof are made from the lightweight polymer, Rhulite,\u00a0laminated with thermal insulation, which clips straight onto the shelter's steel pole frame. They are strong enough to withstand the harsh climates seen in refugee camps. The material was specially developed to allow daylight to penetrate the shelter during the day but also to trap light sources emitting from inside the tent. It also stops people from being able to see shadows inside the tent, addressing privacy issues. It should assist inhabitants to read, learn and engage at night time under artificial light. A  lightweight insulated technical metallic textile is made with interlaced aluminium and polyolefin strips, designed to reflect heat from the sun during the day and stop the heat escaping from inside the tent at night. There is a solar panel on top, laminated on a thin plastic film, designed to generate electricity for a light and USB port inside the unit. But it is hoped the specially-designed shelters will bring an end to the grim conditions, with flexible solar panels on the roofs for power, and specially-made walls that can deflect heat during the day and retain it at night. At 1.75 metres high, they are tall enough for people to stand, and even have lockable doors, ventilation, solar panels, mosquito nets and lights. Mr Scales said: 'The units comprise the best elements of a tent in that it's pre-packed, of minimal weight and produced to core standards, but it also has a rigid, self-supporting frame and it provides more physical security and dignity for its occupants'. The shelters originally cost about \u00a35,000, three times more than a standard UNHCR tent, but are designed to last for at least three years in harsh climates, compared to a tent's average lifespan of six months.\u00a0The firm hopes they could be made for around \u00a3655 each once in mass production. Ikea's philanthropist foundation helped to fund the original project while a Sweden-based group called the Refugee Housing Unit has been working with the UN agency on the design. Jonathan Spampinato, head of strategic planning and Communications, at the IKEA Foundation said they were proud to help the relief effort. Easy to assemble: The shelters take about four hours to build and do not require tools. Home: One gentleman shows his spacious temporary home, both inside and out, at a refugee camp in northern Iraq. The shelters are set to help thousands when they go into mass production. He said: 'Putting refugee families and their needs at the heart of this project is a great example of how democratic design can be used for humanitarian value. 'We are incredibly proud that the Better Shelter is now available, so refugee families and children can have a safer place to call home.' Elsewhere, the Norwegian Refugee Council is piloting a similar type of structure in a refugee camp in Jordan where there are also a number of Syrian families living in container homes provided by Gulf donors."}

Jeffery Thomas, 40, was banned from the teaching profession for starting a'sexually-motivated' relationship with his sixth-form student, Lily-Mai Guard, who is now 18. The couple are now expecting a child together and have recently moved to a home in Windsor to start a new life together. Married design-technology teacher, Mr Thomas, was working at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley, Kent, when he embarked on a relationship with the Year 12 student in 2013. Jeffery Thomas, 40, was banned by a disciplinary hearing for starting a'sexually-motivated' relationship with Year 12 pupil Lily-Mai Guard (together above) at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley, Kent. A disciplinary hearing report published this week revealed Miss Guard stayed at his flat one night after school on his birthday, and witnesses say they were seen kissing at least once. It is not known when the affair first began, but witnesses say they saw them together around 10 times outside school. And Mr Thomas and Miss Guard saw each other increasingly over the summer holidays - while he was still married - making 89 calls and texting 29 times in just one-month. The National College for Teaching and Leadership's misconduct panel banned him from teaching indefinitely and found his 'conduct represents a fundamental abuse of his position of trust'. The relationship between the pair continued despite Miss Guard's brother - a fellow teacher - and the school's vice principal warning him off several times. Mr Thomas, who resigned in September 2013, accepted his conduct had breached professional boundaries but denied his behaviour was sexually motivated. However, the report says that during a heated row, Mr Thomas told his wife \u2013 who has now moved to the US \u2013 that he had kissed the girl. And while the panel found no evidence of a sexual relationship while the pupil was at school, they heard the pair were now living together and the teenager is expecting their first child. The report concluded: 'The fact that Mr Thomas continued to maintain and develop the relationship with student A whilst she was a student, in the face of very clear advice and warnings as to his behaviour, is an aggravating factor in this case. 'Mr Thomas's behaviour undermines public confidence in the profession and damages its collective reputation. In a statement Mr Thomas - known as Jeff - claimed that Miss Guard only stayed at his house once because'she knew I was low and alone on my birthday.' 'She arrived at my flat late and unannounced,' he said. 'We went to the cinema and she ended up sleeping on the bed (me on the sofa) because she missed her last train home.' Mr Thomas (pictured) was working at the school as a design and technology teacher when he embarked on a relationship with the student. She is now said to be expecting his baby and the pair now live together. He added that 'with hindsight' he realised it was his fault and he'should have sent her home when she arrived.' Miss Guard, a fan of dogs and reality shows such as Made in Chelsea, lived with her parents and six siblings before she moved to Windsor in Berkshire, with her former teacher. The 18-year-old, who often posts light-hearted short videos of herself and friends on social media - openly states she is in a relationship with Mr Thomas on Facebook. It is understood the couple moved to Windsor because he has family living there. One former student wrote anonymously on social media: 'To everyone saying this is fine because he's not her teacher anymore, I think this is disgusting. 'Mr Thomas taught me and during her lessons he would always be with her and just put on a film or something for us, he was a lovely teacher, friendly, etc and I feel sick knowing he taught me.' Another added: 'Mr Thomas WAS an excellent teacher who abused his position. To those who know him and the girl in question it is sickening. 'I feel for the students that he taught for letting them down so badly in their exam year. It is my understanding that quite a few pupils were aware of some sort of inappropriate friendship from year 11. 'The whole story is sad.' Mr Thomas was working at the school when he embarked on a relationship with the Year 12 student, from Downham, Bromley, in 2013. The report from the disciplinary hearing reveals the pair exchanged phone numbers, making 89 calls and texting 29 times over a one-month period during the summer holidays. And a former pupil, who also did not want to be named, said: 'I always saw them together whilst Mr Thomas was helping her with coursework or if she had a 'free lesson'.' 'After a while I noticed they were hanging around a lot more than a normal teacher would with a student but I didn't really take notice.

It was a holiday to treat some of the boys he was with. 'The end of that weekend before he went he was just there \u2013 he wanted to have a big show and try to get more investors. He was asking for the best people, the richest. 'It was a party to show people \"look this is what I've got - \u00a0you could have this lifestyle\". 'He sprayed half of the bottles for the first five minutes and then sprayed again. He wanted to make sure that people saw that he was there. He stayed there for the whole afternoon. 'McIndoe doesn't drink himself but his guests were worse for wear by the end of it. 'After that day I am told he never went back \u2013 he did his sales pitch and moved on.' McIndoe is alleged to have persuaded footballers to invest in the scheme, then blew a fortune on women, cars, houses and holidays before bankruptcy. Investors reportedly lost a combined \u00a330 million when the scheme collapsed in late 2011. The scheme is currently being investigated by police, while McIndoe has a bankruptcy hearing this week after previously telling the court that he was living off the generosity of friends and family. A spokesman from the Metropolitan police confirmed to MailOnline that an allegation of fraud was made to Westminster CID in February last year. No arrests have been made. At the height of his spending, McIndoe hired a modernist \u00a32million mansion for \u00a327,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree in Marbella. His friends had\u00a0bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs, while back in London he hired\u00a0pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' one footballer, who lost around \u00a375,000 in the scheme. The scheme is thought to have attracted 300 players, including a number from the lower leagues, and he told original investors to get others involved so they could make more money. McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays.

Shelia Jones, who is in charge of more than 200 pupils at St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school in Devizes, Wiltshire, allegedly humiliated the children on more than one occasion, it is claimed. Angry parents have written to the school's governors and complained to the education watchdog Ofsted after the revelations came to light. Tammy Brimble claims her 11-year-old son Cyrus was among three other boys threatened by Mrs Jones with a 'phone call to God' and is calling for her to resign. She said: 'I didn't find out about it will we got home. Cyrus was very quiet and I could tell something was bothering him. 'When he told me what had happened to him and three other boys, I was upset but I wanted to find out why she did it. 'I don't think what she did was appropriate at all. We are not Roman Catholics but it was still distressing for my child for her to call on God like that.' Mrs Brimble made several attempts to speak to the headteacher and eventually wrote a letter of complaint to the school governors and Ofsted. She said in a letter to Simon Napper, deputy chairman of the governors: 'Cyrus has been subjected to the humiliation of being punished by Sheila on more than one occasion by having to lie face down on the floor. 'We have witnesses for this too, and the evidence of the harm this has caused him.' Another parent, Alexandra Jones, who used to work as a lunchtime supervisor, has also complained to Ofsted. Furious parents at have complained to the school's (pictured) governors and Ofsted after the revelations. She said: 'All the children were whispering about something and then it came out that Sheila had made some of them lie face down in the prayer room while she pretended to ring God on her mobile phone.' Ofsted has asked Wiltshire Council's safeguarding panel to investigate the parents' complaints. In a letter to another parent who cited 'problems' at the school, Ofsted replied: 'The information provided raised concerns about the safety of children. 'Ofsted has shared your concerns with the local authority so they can progress these safeguarding concerns as they consider appropriate.' The school, which was rated as 'needing improvements' at its last Ofsted review in February 2013, is due to receive inspectors for a fresh assessment within a few days. The education watchdog said it was not willing to comment further. Colette Culligan, chairman of the governors, said: 'We are aware of an\u00a0allegation against one of the teaching staff. 'In order to follow due process, all inquiries regarding this issue need to be directed to Wiltshire Council. The school, founded in 1864 (pictured), is said to be aware of the allegation and the issue has been directed to Wiltshire Council. The local authority says it will need to receive a letter from Ofsted before investigating. 'This is to ensure that any investigation currently being conducted is not unduly influenced.' A Wiltshire Council spokesman said: 'Once we have received the letter from Ofsted we will look into any concerns raised.' On the school's website, Mrs Jones claims in her welcome message that the faith school is 'built on gospel values of love, tolerance, forgiveness and compassion'. She adds: 'We aim to be a loving community which is inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ.' The school was founded in 1864 when a group of sisters opened a Roman Catholic 'poor school' in an improvised\u00a0Roman Catholic chapel and has been called St Joseph's since 1886. It has previously come under fire in another row where teachers called for Mrs Jones to resign after she was accused of being a 'liability' by parents. Governors said in February they had investigated but dismissed the complaints and agreed lessons needed to be learned. A number of parents came forward to say they were no longer happy with the school, which was once considered one of the best in the area."}

In the Diros Caves in the Peloponnese region of Greece, an excavation of the 'underworld' cavern uncovered the remains of a young couple buried together in a final embrace, dating back almost 5,800 years. The Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy was found to have been used by farmers from villages up to 12 miles away to bring their dead, with cut marks on the bones suggesting they had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave.", "article": "Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Many bones, such as this fibula, found in the Scaloria Cave showed fine cut marks made with stone tools. Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process. Dr John Robb, a reader in European prehistory at the University of Cambridge, and his team say it might have been a way of returning the bones to their stone like origins. In 3,800BC a young couple were buried together in a final embrace that was hoped to keep them together for all eternity. Now the remains of the man and woman - who are said to have died in their twenties - have been uncovered in the Diros Caves in the Peloponnese region of Greece. An archaeologist leading the excavation of the \u2018underworld\u2019 cavern described the find as \u2018stunning\u2019 and said it is possibly the oldest grave ever found in the country. The remains were initially unearthed in 2013 and have now been analysed using radiocarbon dating. The results of the analysis showed the bones belonged to a man and a woman, both aged between 20 and 25, dating back almost 5,800 years. The cavern is known as Alepotrypa - or 'foxhole' - and was found in the 1950s. Experts believe hundreds of people lived inside Alepotrypa before the entrance collapsed burying everyone alive. They say that many of the stalactites in the cave resemble bones themselves and the floor of the cave is littered with long, thin broken stalactites. Farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Robb and his colleagues said: 'Neolithic people at Scaloria Cave engaged in a varied range of funerary practices including primary burial, skull removal and redeposition, and defleshing and secondary deposition. 'If we suppose that stalactites were understood as equivalent to bones on a stone-like plane of existence, then cleaning bones and returning them to the stalactite-filled cave may have been understood as returning the bones to an eternal place where they came into being, the conclusion of a cycle of temporal incarnation. 'Conversely, the water that formed'stone bones' in the cave (stalactites) and hence bones in the living may have been understood as spiritually powerful or nourishing.' Scaloria Cave stretches deep underground and is composed of at least two main chambers. It was completely sealed off until its discovery in 1931, when human remains, stone tools and broken pottery were discovered inside. The lowest section of the cave is only accessible though a narrow and steep passage that can only be crawled through. There Neolithic people placed pottery vessels where dripping water from the stalactites collected. Scaloria cave is a deep multi-caverned grotto in Tavoliere region of Puglie, in southeastern Italy, shown above. The delicate stalactites in the cave (left ) resemble bones as can be seen in the image on the right where a collection of bones recovered from the cave and stalactite fragments found among them on the cave floor. Archaeologists found more than 40 pots encrusted into the stalactites themselves. The upper chamber is more than 260 feet (80 metres) long and around 6 feet (2 metres) high. This area was occasionally inhabited and used to keep livestock but was also were farmers from the surrounding area placed their dead. In 1978 the fragmented remains of between 22 and 31 individuals were discovered in the chamber, around half of which were children. In one case one child aged between five and seven years old that dated to 5463-5221 BC had been buried complete but the skull had been later removed. An isolated adult skull was also found in a small stone niche in the cave. Dr Robb and his colleagues, which include Dr Ernestine Elster at University of California Los Angeles and researchers from the University of Rome and the\u00a0Italian Institute of Experimental Archaeology,\u00a0examined the bones, which have been lent to the University of Cambridge by the Archaeological National Museum in Manfredonia. The bones were found among pieces of broken pottery in the Scaloria cave during excavations in 1971. They found no evidence of gnawing or damage caused by animals and few of the bones had been broken. However they did find that the bones were covered in small, barely visible cut marks made using flint or other stone tools. They found no heavy chop marks and instead it appears they had been cut using controlled, fine incisions. They said they found cut marks through out"}

Speaker Deborah Haygarth was hoisted out of her chair and escorted by two people up the four stairs between the floor and the raised stage. Disability rights advocate Jax-Jacki Brown was at the National Disability Summit at Melbourne's Sheraton Hotel last Thursday and was outraged by the oversight. Speaker Deborah Haygarth, who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to get out of her wheelchair and carried by two people on and off the stage. 'I thought 'They're going to pull out a ramp, they obviously planned for this',' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'No ramp was forthcoming so the next best thing is they are going to move the table and microphone so she can sit with everyone else, but they didn't do that. 'They suggested she move out of her chair and be carried on by two people.' Ms Brown - who is a wheelchair-user herself - said it was degrading to see a person in a wheelchair be treated like that. 'It just removes your agency and your power to move around the world,' she said. 'It makes you dependent on someone to give assistance. To add further insult, chairs were stacked inside the disabled toilets, preventing people from using it. 'It's not the way you want to be able to be seen. It's not an empowering way to enter a stage.' To add further insult, the disabled toilet at the venue had been stacked up with chairs, preventing people in wheelchairs who had to go to the bathroom from using it. Ms Brown said disabled toilets were often seen as secondary storage spaces. 'To use a toilet is quite crucial and a fundamental right that non-disabled people take for granted,' she said. 'It speaks volumes about the space the National Disability Summit was held in. 'I mean we don't even have the right to pee.' Susan Ryan, who is the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, said she had written to the organisers of the summit. Disability rights advocate Jax-Jacki Brown was at the National Disability Summit in Melbourne and said it was a degrading sight to see. The Sheraton Hotel in Melbourne has apologised for the incident, saying they 'fell short' of delivering all their duties, and vowed a similar incident would not reoccur.

'We will ensure every effort is made to further improve the accessibility in our hotel premises, so that such incidents do not re-occur,' Mr Philip added. But this is not the first controversy the National Disability Summit has attracted. This year, only seven people with a disability were allowed to attend the two-day conference, causing a social media outrage.

Little Jayden Taljaard took the model handgun - which does not fire or make a noise - to a regular Friday class where pupils can bring their own toys. But staff called the police after three teachers reported feeling 'threatened' by the replica. It emerged today that Jayden has been immediately suspended from Selwood Academy in Frome, Somerset, and has  been told he could be permanently excluded. Jayden Taljaard, pictured with his mother\u00a0Natasha Taljaard, was sent home from school and now faces potential expulsion after he took an orange toy gun in for a 'golden hour' session in his class. A police officer is due to visit the youngster at home to warn him of the dangers of firearms. But Jayden's stepfather Kevin Pleasants said the schoolboy had made a simple mistake and the issue has been 'blown out of all proportion'. The 56-year-old construction worker said: 'We were totally unaware that a bright orange toy gun that doesn't fire anything would cause so much mayhem. 'We have a policeman coming to the house to give him a lecture on the dangers of firearms - he's 10, it's ridiculous. 'It's being blown out of all proportion. We had no idea about the school's policy on toy guns. It's a simple mistake. 'He asked his mother if he could take a toy to school. She didn't let him at first. He explained about golden time and took the gun. 'Three teachers said they felt threatened by this gun. Could they not see it was bright orange and plastic?' Jayden's parents have hit out at the school's actions after teachers said they felt 'threatened' by the gun. They insist the gun does not fire or make a noise and teachers 'blowing the incident out of all proportion' Jayden's school holds the so-called 'Golden Hour' sessions for the last hour of every Friday where pupils are allowed to bring in a toy of their choice. But Jayden was suspended after taking in the replica weapon on February 27 and told not to return until Monday 9 March. At meeting on Wednesday evening, his mother Natasha was then told his exclusion could be made permanent. Jayden suffers from ADHD and other learning difficulties but was making good progress at the school since joining in September, according to his parents. Mr Pleasants, from Frome, added: 'He was supposed to go back on Monday but my partner had a meeting at the school and they said he might not be allowed back. 'He was doing fine at the school. He brought an award home for very good behaviour. I framed it and it is on his wall.' The school has brought in the police over the incident and officers will now talk to the 10-year-old boy. Selwood Academy has not commented on its threat to expel Jayden other than to say it will handle the issue 'internally' Mr Pleasants added: 'My partner is devastated by this. She is in a state of depression. She feels like she has failed as a mother. 'I think that they can't handle Jayden and this is an excuse. We worked hard to find the right medication for him and we think we finally have. He was making progress.

Eventually, Abreham Zemedagegehu learned that he'd been accused of stealing an iPad \u2014 an iPad whose owner later found it. He spent the next six weeks in jail, unable to communicate with his jailers because he is deaf. He described a frightening, isolated experience in which medical procedures were performed without his consent and he feared for his safety. Zemedagegehu sued the Arlington County sheriff last month in federal court, saying his treatment failed to meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Suing: A U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia, Abreham Zemedagegehu\u00a0learned that he'd been accused of stealing an iPad--an iPad whose owner later found it. 'I felt like I was losing my mind,' Zemedagegehu said through an interpreter in an interview at his lawyer's office. 'I thought Virginia would give me an interpreter and they said no. That's why I felt lost.' Zemedagegehu, who is homeless, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia. He grew up using Ethiopian Sign Language. He has learned American Sign Language, but he has never learned more than rudimentary written English. Maj. Susie Doyel, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, which runs the jail, declined to comment on the specific allegations. She generally defended the jail's ability to handle deaf inmates and others with disabilities, and said several deputies in the jail are proficient in sign language. But she also acknowledged that communication with a deaf inmate is more problematic in cases where the inmate can't communicate in written English. In court papers filed Monday, lawyers for the sheriff ask a judge to dismiss the case, arguing that even if Zemedagegehu's allegations are true, they fail to show intentional discrimination because they attempted various different ways to communicate with him, including handwritten notes. And even if the discrimination were intentional, the lawyers write that it would not violate federal law because there is a rational basis for the discrimination: 'it takes extra resources and creates additional security considerations to bring in an ASL interpreter,' they write. Zemedagegehu's ordeal began Feb. 2, 2014, as he sought a warm place to sleep at Reagan National Airport. According to Zemedagegehu's lawsuit, officers from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority arrested him on a complaint that he had stolen another man's iPad. Jailed: He spent the next six weeks in jail, unable to communicate with his jailers because he is deaf. He described a frightening, isolated experience in which medical procedures were performed without his consent and he feared for. Zemedagegehu says he requested an ASL interpreter to explain what was happening, but instead was taken to the Arlington jail for processing. He said the booking process was bewildering, with someone speaking on a video screen and he not understanding what was happening. After he was booked, he underwent a medical screening, and says he was given forms to sign. He didn't know what they were, and refused to sign them. He says they stuck a needle in his arm without explaining what was occurring \u2014 he later learned it was tuberculosis test, to which he suffered a bad reaction. It was not until he was arraigned Feb. 4, and a court interpreter was present, that he understood the charge against him. When he was offered an opportunity to communicate, he said the jail provided a TTY device. Zemedagegehu said the machine was useless \u2014 it types out English text he doesn't understand, and as a practical matter, he said, no one in the deaf community still uses a TTY device. He needed instead access to a videophone or video relay service that is more commonly used, he said. Maj. David Kidwell, director of the jail for the sheriff, also declined to comment specifically on Zemedagegehu's care, but generally defended the use of a TTY machine. 'It gets used, absolutely. It's an accepted practice, and we've had great success with it,' he said. On March 14, 2014, Zemedagegehu struck a plea deal, pleading guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges in exchange for time served. Zemedagegehu says he only took the deal to get of jail, and that he didn't steal the iPad. Zemedagegehu's public defender filed a motion after the guilty plea seeking to have the conviction overturned, saying prosecutors failed to turn over evidence that the man who claimed his iPad was stolen actually had found it some time before the guilty plea. Prosecutors deny withholding evidence. A judge refused to overturn the conviction, saying the appeal had been filed too late. Zemedagegehu sued the Arlington County sheriff last month in federal court, saying his treatment failed to meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Zemedagegehu said he doesn't understand why it was so difficult for the legal system to accommodate him with an interpreter."}

In recent weeks, surgeons successfully constructed a new nose for the 27-year-old bushfire survivor. But her family were on edge throughout the entire procedure, with Ms Pitt telling Woman's Day\u00a0she stopped breathing during the operation. Scroll down for video. New nose: Turia Pitt, pictured with mother Celestine and her new nose, was competing in an ultra-marathon through WA's Kimberley region in 2011 when she was caught in a bushfire. Before: Ms Pitt spent more than two years in hospital, much of it wearing a compression stocking (left) after experiencing burns to around 65 per cent of the body. Her face is pictured right prior to the reconstructive surgery on her nose performed recently. Burns victim: Ms Pitt experienced burns to around 70 per cent of her body during the 2011 bushfire. After years of recovery, Ms Pitt told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long!\" Prior to the bushfire, Ms Pitt, from Ulladulla, on the NSW south coast, worked as a mining engineer and a model. Her mother, Celestine Vaite, said she and Turia's partner Michael Hoskin heard the hospital's cardiac arrest alarm go off 'and we thought she was gone'. 'I said, God, don't you dare. She's fought so hard, this girl,' she told the magazine. 'She fought to get out of bed, she fought to walk, she fought to accept - don't you dare do that to her!' It has been a long road to recovery for Ms Pitt, who suffered burns to around 65 per cent of her body when she was caught in a bushfire in the Kimberley in September 2011. Ms Pitt wore a compression stocking for almost two years and had seven of her fingers amputated during a seemingly endless series of operations. But she was not expecting complications in this latest procedure.\u00a0Ms Pitt told the magazine: 'I thought I'd wake up in the burns unit, but instead I woke up in ICU.' Her family were relieved when she woke - and Ms Pitt is now happily showing off her reconstructed nose on social media. Milestone woman: Ms Pitt published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For. Soul mates: Turia Pitt's boyfriend, Michael Hoskin, has been by her side since the very beginning of her hospital experience. Up and at it: Ms Pitt agreed to an out-of-court settlement with ultra-marathon event organisers Racing The Planet in 2014. Ultra-marathon runner: Ms Pitt is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman in 2016, after a further operation to her nose. She told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long'. It's just the latest in a series of milestones for Ms Pitt, who last year published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For. She starred on the front cover of magazine The Australian Women's Weekly in June 2014. The cover won praise for featuring Ms Pitt. Ms Pitt has headlined a number of a speaking opportunities and in June 2014 she trekked the Great Wall of China to raise more than $175,000AUD for the charityInterplast. Interplast sends teams of volunteer medical workers to developing countries in Asia to provide free surgery for people suffering conditions including cleft lip and palate and burn scar contractures. Ms Pitt told Woman's Day she is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman next year, following an operation to'refine her nose and widen her nostrils'.

Vietnamese media said the overworked animal died while it was carrying tourists in the Buon Don District in Dak Lak province. It is at least the second high-profile death this year involving a captive elephant in Vietnam and comes as the population shrinks due to exhaustion and deforestation. Vietnamese media said the elephant dropped dead while carrying tourists in Dak Lak province (file photo) Tuoi Tre News said local agencies reported the elephant\u2019s death to the People\u2019s Committee of Krong Na Commune in the Central Highlands province, located on Vietnam\u2019s border with Cambodia. The elephant\u2019s carcass was examined by local authorities before it was destroyed according to current regulations, the newspaper reported.

{"abstract": "Arsenal won 2-0 against Everton on Sunday, with goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky. The Gunners responded well to their midweek Champions League loss to Monaco, with a defensive concentration that was much higher than on Wednesday. Despite Everton's positive start to the second half, Arsenal managed to keep a clean sheet and secure the win.", "article": "For once, the focus of north London did not fall on Arsenal on Sunday. After the week they've had, Arsene Wenger was happy to shun the limelight this time. Ask Gunners fans prior to kick-off if they'd rather three points or a Tottenham defeat in the Capital One Cup final and you'd have been greeted with differing opinions. As it happened, they all got their wish. Their arch-rivals lost to Chelsea at Wembley and Arsenal got their win \u2014 by the same scoreline, \u2014 courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky, to move four points behind second-placed Manchester City. Olivier Giroud points to the sky after scoring the opener against Everton at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Giroud had a less than enjoyable time in his side's Champions League defeat against Monaco on Wednesday. The French striker congratulates team-mate Tomas Rosicky after he doubled the Gunners' lead on Sunday. But much like their demoralising Champions League loss to Monaco on Wednesday night, this didn't make for comfortable viewing. The 2-0 score doesn't tell the full story. This was unconvincing from Arsenal; the Emirates Stadium a bag of nerves until Rosicky's last-minute goal. Nevertheless, while their participation in this year's Champions League is under huge threat, their qualification for next year's competition remains on course. Despite their lack of fluency, Wenger would have been pleased with the response shown by his wounded players following the midweek loss. Giroud, barracked by his own supporters on Wednesday, did not hide; likewise Francis Coquelin, who played on after breaking his nose. This wasn't the Arsenal we're accustomed to, but after the Monaco monstrosity that didn't concern Wenger. 'I think what was really important was the mentally united response,' he said. Rosicky had been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he doubled Arsenal's lead at the Emirates. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said he was proud of his side's response to the loss against Monaco. 'I am very proud of the response we have shown. Our defensive concentration was at a much higher level than on Wednesday. 'We know with the ball we can do better but overall what was important for us was to respond with a win. Not everyone can produce that after such a disappointment and it was vital for us to win.' Wenger's comments, particularly regarding his side's defensive stability, will have resonated with Per Mertesacker. The Frenchman rang the changes following Wednesday's loss. Vice-captain Mertesacker and Danny Welbeck were axed and replaced by Gabriel and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. For Gabriel, in particular, this was a huge opportunity. Per Mertesacker (right) was demoted to the bench following Arsenal's Champions League loss to Monaco. Giroud shows his strength in an impressive display to hold the challenge from Everton defender Phil Jagielka. Mertesacker's role in the starting XI has been called into huge question this season following a string of below-par displays, including against Monaco. On reflection, it wasn't the most convincing of performances from the 24-year-old on his first Premier League start since arriving for \u00a313.5million from Villareal in January. A clean sheet is a clean sheet, though. Mertesacker knows that more than most. Gabriel very nearly gifted the visitors an early lead, failing to deal with a long-ball to allow Romelu Lukaku a free run at David Ospina. Thankfully for the Brazilian, his fellow South American bailed him out with some fine goalkeeping. A goal would not have flattered Everton, who started brightly. Arsenal, though, were lethargic. Giroud, unmarked from six yards, headed wide in the 28th minute after escaping the attentions of Phil Jagielka inside the penalty area. It was the last thing the striker needed after his wasteful display on Wednesday. But this time supporters didn't get on his back, responding to the miss by chanting his name. Arsenal's Gabriel (right) did not have the most convincing performance but managed to keep a clean sheet. Francis Coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team-mate before being hit in the face. This certainly had the desired effect, as the France international nipped in front of John Stones to flick home Mesut Ozil's corner in the 39th minute. Gareth Barry tried, spectacularly, to put Everton level but his acrobatic bicycle kick flew over. Kevin Mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by Andre Marriner, after claiming Oxlade-Chamberlain had handled. Much like the first half, Roberto Martinez's side made a positive start after the break \u2014 Luke Garbutt's dead-ball delivery causing Arsenal's defence problems. Aaron Lennon, given his Spurs connections, was afforded a horrendous welcome when introduced in the 62nd minute. There would have been greater boos three minutes later had Ospina not tipped over Luk"}

A marathon on Mars: This map shows the rover's entire traverse from landing to that point. Opportunity and its twin Spirit landed on Mars in January 2004 for what was supposed to be a three-month mission. Both uncovered geologic signs of ancient water. Spirit's mission ended in 2011 not long after it got stuck in Martian sand. Scientists and engineers will celebrate Opportunity's achievement by holding their own marathon relay at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission. Last year, Opportunity broke the record for off-Earth distance traveled that was previously held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 moon rover. Opportunity and its twin Spirit landed on Mars in January 2004 for what was supposed to be a three-month mission. Both uncovered geologic signs of ancient water. Spirit's mission ended in 2011 not long after it got stuck in Martian sand. 'This is the first time any human enterprise has exceeded the distance of a marathon on the surface of another world,' said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. 'A first time happens only once.' The long-lived rover surpassed the marathon mark during a drive of 153 feet (46.5 meters). The vehicle surpassed marathon distance of 26.219 miles (42.195 kilometers) with a drive completed on March 24, 2015, during the 3,968th Martian day, or sol, of Opportunity's work on Mars. Some of the  highlights along the route as NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity drove as far as a marathon race during the first 11 years and two months after its January 2004 landing in Eagle Crater. This Jan. 6, 2015 panorama provided by NASA of a 'Marathon Valley' was taken by the NASA rover Opportunity. 'This mission isn't about setting distance records, of course; it's about making scientific discoveries on Mars and inspiring future explorers to achieve even more,' said Steve Squyres, Opportunity principal investigator at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. 'Still, running a marathon on Mars feels pretty cool.' Opportunity's original three-month prime mission in 2004 yielded evidence of environments with liquid water soaking the ground and flowing on planet's surface. As the rover continued to operate far beyond expectations for its lifespan, scientists chose the rim of Endeavour Crater as a long-term destination. Since 2011, examinations of Endeavour's rim have provided information about ancient wet conditions less acidic, and more favourable for microbial life, than the environment that left clues found earlier in the mission. Earlier this year an increasing frequency of computer resets has prompted the rover team to make plans to reformat the rover's flash memory. The resets, including a dozen this month, interfere with the rover's planned science activities, even though recovery from each incident is completed within a day or two. 'Worn-out cells in the flash memory are the leading suspect in causing these resets,' said John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, project manager for NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project. 'The flash reformatting is a low-risk process, as critical sequences and flight software are stored elsewhere in other non-volatile memory on the rover.' Flash memory retains data even when power is off. It is the type used for storing photos and songs on smart phones or digital cameras, among many other uses.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has spoken about ticket costs in the wake of the new \u00a35.1billion TV rights deal, recognizing the importance of what fans contribute to what they are selling.", "article": "The Premier League can easily accommodate an initiative to limit away fans tickets at \u00a320 to protect the'spectacle' of their product, according to the chief executive of the Football Supporters' Federation Kevin Miles. Chairmen of English football's 20 elite clubs met in central London on Wednesday for the first time since the bumper new \u00a35.14billion television broadcasting deal was announced. The FSF presented an open letter to the chairmen, which was co-signed by fan groups from every Premier League club, detailing what it believes are key elements to such as the cost of attending live matches, facilities for away fans, more supporter engagement as well a fairer distribution of football's wealth throughout the domestic game and grassroots. Football Supporters' Federation campaigners demonstrate outside the meeting of Premier League chairmen. Ticket prices have long been a thorny issue within the modern game, particularly for the away supporters, who often feel they are not being given a fair price especially those of the leading clubs. A recent survey by the FSF showed the likes of Arsenal's top price for visiting supporters was \u00a364, QPR charged \u00a355 while Sunderland were cheapest at \u00a339. Crystal Palace charged both home and away fans \u00a340 at Selhurst Park. FSF chief executive Miles believes making such a gesture would not only show a level of good will to paying customers, but also maintain the unique live atmosphere which makes the Premier League such an attractive proposition. The FSF's Chief Executive, Kevin Miles, speaks during the 'Share TV Wealth' demonstration. 'The uplift on domestic television rights alone, not including the overseas deal, is the equivalent of more than \u00a340 for every single ticket sold at each game over the three years, so that gives you an idea of how much manoeuvre the clubs have got - and with that much money going into the game, how they could afford to treat people a lot better,' Miles said. 'The Premier League has already set one or two precedents, there are already rules to benefit away fans, like how many seats they have to allocate in the stadium and how they cannot charge away fans more than the home fans for similar accommodation. 'They also ring-fence money via the \"Away Fans Initiative\" to be invested into increasing numbers of away fans. 'What we are proposing out of this huge increase in money is they increase the amount of money involved.' The FSF have argued that away fans should get in to Premier League games for \u00a320 pounds at every ground. Miles continued: 'Our \"Twenty's Plenty\" idea to be implemented, we believe would cost the clubs around \u00a320million a season, which is \u00a31million per club, then talk to the fans about how they want that money used, it could make a huge difference to the experience of away support. 'They could make this contribution easily and relatively cheaply, to guarantee the atmosphere with participation of away fans to keep their numbers up, which have declined over the last 10 years and that is something which needs to be addressed.' Miles believes any moves to increase the travelling supporters at all Premier League stadia could only have a positive impact. The Premier League's new \u00a35.1billion TV rights deal is set to increase the cost of sponsorship. 'Part of the reason the Premier League is able to generate so much money for the television rights is precisely because of the whole atmosphere and spectacle. It would be short-sighted to think it is just all about what happens on the pitch,' he said. 'The battle is sometimes you have to convince the clubs that it is in their best interest as well as ours, and stress the importance of what fans contribute to what they are selling. 'The Premier League did a survey of television audiences in Thailand when they were looking at overseas matches, what they found was actually fans did not want to see Manchester United against Liverpool in Bangkok, they would love the chance to go to Anfield or Old Trafford to witness the real thing. 'So there are signs the Premier League are starting to look at these things and recognise the importance of it.' Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has spoken about ticket costs in the wake of the deal."}

She is being treated for depression and was accompanied by a young girl believed to be her surviving daughter. The family had been receiving care and support from up to 60 therapists, doctors, nurses and other specialists, and a serious case review is now underway to assess the standard of care they received.", "article": "When Tania Clarence killed her three young severely disabled children \u2013 overwhelmed by the terrible strain of looking after them \u2013 their tragic deaths shocked the nation and inspired a wave of sympathy for her and her family. Four months ago she pleaded guilty on the grounds of diminished responsibility to the manslaughter of her three-year-old twin sons and four-year-old daughter. She was sentenced by an Old Bailey judge to be detained in a psychiatric hospital until her recovery was complete. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that she has been allowed to return to the family home where the killings took place. Tania Clarence, who is being treated for depression, \u00a0has been seen at her \u00a31.2million family home with a girl believed to be her surviving daughter just four months after admitting killing her three terminally ill children. At the court hearing in November, Mrs Clarence was described as a loving and caring mother who had smothered twins Max and Ben and daughter Olivia while in the grip of a severe bout of mental illness brought on by what Mr Justice Sweeney called the \u2018unbearable pressure\u2019 of caring for them. Mrs Clarence\u2019s solicitor said it was one of the saddest cases to come before the criminal courts. Her client\u2019s plea was accepted by the prosecution and the judge imposed a sentence known as a Hospital Order. He ruled that the 43-year-old would need psychiatric treatment and therapy \u2018for the foreseeable future\u2019 and would not be released until she had recovered from her illness. Last week she was photographed for the first time at the house in New Malden, Surrey, where the killings took place. Wearing blue jeans and a dark top and looking like any other mother on the afternoon school run, she arrived at the \u00a31.2 million detached property in a Hyundai people carrier with a small suitcase on wheels and what appeared to be a bag of shopping. She was accompanied by another woman and a young girl \u2013 thought to be her only surviving child, who was eight years old when the terrible events occurred last April. All three went into the seven-bedroom house and the unidentified woman left half an hour later, driving off in a silver Mazda. Mrs Clarence declined to comment when she was approached by a Mail on Sunday reporter but her husband Gary, when told that an article about the family was being prepared for publication this weekend, said: \u2018Okay, fine.\u2019 Family man: Gary Clarence with his three-year-old twin sons Max and Ben. Mr Clarence, 45, is standing by his wife. The South African-born investment banker was on a trip to his home country with their eldest daughter when the killings took place. It is understood that his wife was given a temporary licence several weeks ago to leave the hospital where she is being treated and has been returning home on a regular basis at weekends. Max, Ben and Olivia all had spinal muscular atrophy, which is a devastating muscle-wasting illness sometimes referred to as \u2018floppy baby syndrome\u2019. The surviving daughter does not have the condition. Mrs Clarence, who was severely depressed at the time, lied to the family nanny so she could be alone with the three youngest children while her husband and older daughter were away. After asphyxiating them in their beds, she made what was described in court as a \u2018determined effort\u2019 to kill herself. The judge said the evidence of her diminished responsibility for the children\u2019s deaths was \u2018clear and convincing\u2019. Psychiatrists had explained \u2018in compelling detail\u2019 that her mental illness had substantially impaired her ability to form a rational judgment. The judge said she was a dedicated and caring mother who loved her children but had been overwhelmed by the challenge of caring for them. Last night the NHS trust responsible for Mrs Clarence\u2019s treatment declined to comment on the grounds of patient confidentiality. The hospital where she is being treated also cannot be named for legal reasons. Up to 60 therapists, doctors, nurses and other specialists had been involved with the family over the years, sometimes arriving at the house unannounced and leaving Mrs Clarence feeling insecure and upset, the court was told.

Jacky Pautonnier was returning home from a dinner party when he was accosted on the train platform by a man pestering him to try on his hat. When he refused, the yob went and fetched two friends, who followed him onto the train and beat him unconscious before stealing his beloved headgear. Assault: Jacky Pautonnier was left with horrific injuries after he was attacked by thugs on a train. Horrific: Mr Pautonnier, a French e-cigarette seller, refused to let one yob try on his 'trademark' top hat. Mr Pautonnier, 56, had to undergo reconstructive surgery to repair multiple fractures on his face after the horrific assault, which took place last month on a train between Catford and Charing Cross in London. The French e-cigarette salesman said: 'It's awful. I have been so sad without my top hat. We had spent the day eating cheese and I was tired so I went home alone. 'I was wearing my top hat and this guy carrying bags of spirits pestered me on the platform. 'The guy said, \"Hey mate, can I try on your top hat?\", but the way he asked me wasn't very nice. Usually it wouldn't be a problem but I said no and he wasn't very happy.' Ten minutes later, the thug returned with two friends, and they taunted him again on the platform then boarded the same train as him. Surgery: Mr Pautonnier had to undergo an operation to repair the damage to his face. Injuries: The victim's skull was fractured in three places around the eyes and nose. 'The three guys sat behind me and started to tip my hat and I said, \"Can you stop please?\" but he came and sat next to me,' Mr Pautonnier said. 'Then I got up and one of the guys pushed me against the carriage door and said, \"You are getting on my nerves, why won't you let me wear your hat?\" 'I tried to calm him down but I blacked out here, I lost consciousness.' The father of two woke up at Charing Cross in a pool of blood before taking the Tube home to Canada Water in south-east London and going to sleep. When his partner Jennie Allen arrived home she convinced him to go to hospital, where X-rays revealed that he had fractures below his left eye, on his nose and on the top of his left eye. Gruesome: The scene on the train after Mr Pautonnier was beaten up and left unconscious. Suspects: Police are trying to speak to these three men over the assault on Mr Pautonnier. Mr Pautonnier, who is president of the Association of London Normans, bought the hat for \u00a345 in 2008 from the Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street after his son Alex said it suited him. Alex, now a 24-year-old chef in London, convinced his father to wear it to work the next day and Mr Pautonnier went on to make a habit of it. 'I wore it to work and everybody commented that it suited me,' he said. 'I've worn it ever since and it has become my trademark. 'I feel sad without it. I've got another one but it's just not the same.' British Transport Police released surveillance camera footage of three men they wish to talk to following the assault but are yet to make any arrests. Investigating officer Stephen Allen said: 'I am keen to speak to the men in the CCTV images as they may hold vital information to my investigation and I urge them to come forward.'"}
{"abstract": "A balloon carrying the Planetary Atmospheres Minor Species Sensor (PAMSS) was sent on a mission to detect traces of alien life on other planets. The sensor is capable of detecting trace gases at parts per trillion, and could potentially detect low levels of methane on other planets as an indication of life. Scientists have also found evidence of microscopic organisms living in the Earth's atmosphere, suggesting that life may have arrived on Earth from space.", "article": "A balloon carrying sensors designed to detect the faint traces left by alien life on other planets has been sent on a mission high into the Earth's atmosphere. The Planetary Atmospheres Minor Species Sensor (PAMSS) spent more than an hour at 105,000 feet above the Earth's surface taking measurements before parachuting safely back to the ground. The experimental sensor, developed by researchers at Nasa and the University of Central Florida, was being tested ahead of plans to send the device to other planets. The high altitude balloon above carried the new highly sensitive instrument 19.8 miles into the atmosphere. Capable of detecting traces of gas at parts per trillion - far more sensitive from current technologies - it could reveal the existence of life on other planets. Even low levels of methane on a planet could indicate that there is life there breaking down organic material. The PAMSS sensor is launched into the air beneath a high-altitude balloon from Tucson, Arizona. Professor Robert Peale, a physicist at the University of Central Florida who is leading the project, said: 'Our sensor has the potential to detect specific gases at extremely low concentrations. 'Metabolic byproducts of life include characteristic gases like methane, which on Mars would be a very low concentrations.' Professor Peale and his team launched their sensor, which uses an infrared laser the size of a grain of salt, on a high altitude balloon from Tucson, Arizona, on Sunday. The toaster-sized device uses a technique known as 'intracavity laser absorption spectrometry' to detect small amounts of gas. Most atmospheric probes used to day are unable to measure the concentration of trace vapours or gases. However, Nasa hopes that by using the PAMSS they may be able to detect small amounts of methane on other worlds like Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Low levels of methane have already been detected on Mars with hot spots where levels are thought to spike. Scientists now want to explore these more closely in the hope that here may still be life existing somewhere beneath the surface. The test on the balloon was designed to show that the PAMSS could function in the extreme cold and low pressures of near space. In the stratosphere temperatures fall as low as -75\u00b0F (-59\u00b0C). Scientists claim to have discovered evidence that suggests there may be alien life living high up in our own atmosphere. Researchers from the University of Sheffield and Buckingham University claim to have gathered samples that show microscopic organisms are living 16 miles up in the stratosphere. Using a high-altitude balloon, they gathered samples of dust and other microscopic debris high above the Earth's surface and say they found fragments of single celled algae known as a diatom. They argue that this could be the first evidence to show how life may have arrived on Earth from space, perhaps carried here by meteorites. It is not the first time organisms have been found in the atmosphere and indeed the skies are thought to be teeming with microscopic life. Scientists working with Nasa found 314 different types of bacteria living in the atmosphere up to five miles above the Atlantic Ocean and the US in 2012. They concluded the bacteria, which accounted for 20 per cent of the particles they collected, were carried up into the atmosphere by wind currents. However the team believe the device could also have applications on Earth to help monitor changes in the ozone layer as well as helping to detect traces of gas in breath tests to help diagnose disease. Professor Peale said: 'The flight was very successful. The balloon reached 105,000 ft for over one hour, achieving objectives.'The instrument parachuted safely back to earth and I was able to join the recovery team. 'Our instrument functioned, and a first look at the data show expected types of numbers. It will take a while to analyze all of the data.' The\u00a0Planetary Atmospheres Minor Species Sensor, shown above sitting on top of laboratory equipment being used to calibrate the device, is about the size of a domestic toaster and can detect minute traces of gases."}

'I was another beneficiary of America\u2019s wonderful generosity,' president Ghani said. 'I ate corned beef at Katz\u2019s, New York\u2019s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' he added as the room erupted in unanimous laughter. Katz's, established in 1888, is the oldest delicatessen in New York City. Peaceful meeting: President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani  delivered an address to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday where he expressed his love for Katz's Deli in New York. The establishment is open daily staring at 8:00am and is open all night on Friday and Saturday. For 18.75 a patron can scoop up Ghani's favorite Corned Beef creation. 'Our secret \"dry cure\" pickling formula requires a full month to be ready to serve,' says Katz's website of the delicacy. 'The secret to finishing is to pace yourself,' adds the New York staple's page. Ghani also thanked Congress for slowly but surely helping to rebuild his country following the Afghanistan war in 2001. He expressed his gratitude for the millions of American tax dollars and vowed his war-wracked country will be self-reliant within this decade. 'We're not going to be the lazy Uncle Joe,' he said. President's favorite:\u00a0'I was another beneficiary of America\u2019s wonderful generosity,' president Ghani said. 'I ate corned beef at Katz\u2019s, New York\u2019s greatest, greasiest, pickle-lined melting pot,' Ghani said on Wednesday. In a speech to a joint meeting of Congress, Ghani moved to mend U.S.-Afghan relations that were frayed under former President Hamid Karzai. Lawmakers have been critical about the lengthy U.S. troop presence in America's longest war, wasteful spending in Afghanistan and were stung by Karzai's anti-American rhetoric. Ghani humbly thanked Congress for the nearly $107 billion it has appropriated for Afghanistan so far. He paid homage to the 2,200 U.S. servicemen and -women who lost their lives in the war and the thousands more who were wounded, and thanked the U.S. aid workers who built schools, wells and cured the sick. 'At the end of the day, it is the ordinary Americans whose hard-earned taxes have over the years built the partnership that has led to our conversation today,' he said to applause in the House chamber packed with hundreds of lawmakers, dignitaries and guests. Ghani, wearing a gray western suit, peppered his speech with anecdotes about the time he's spent in America, noting that he graduated from Columbia University in New York and was in his World Bank office in Washington when the first plane smashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11. He touched on themes he hoped would convince lawmakers that he will be a reliable U.S. partner. Oldest Deli: Katz's, established in 1888, is the oldest delicatessen in New York City and is home to their famous corned beef sandwich. He admitted that decades of war have resulted in high levels of fraud and graft in Afghanistan and promised to eliminate corruption. Ghani also voiced support for women's rights and said he would emphasize law and justice and focus on self-reliance and economic development. 'We don't want your charity. We have no more interest in perpetuating a childish dependence than you have in being saddled with a poor family member who lacks the energy and drive to get out and find a job,' Ghani said. That's a tall order for Afghanistan. The national unity government that Ghani runs with chief executive Abdullah Abdullah has not yet seated a full cabinet, and some of the country's 30-plus provinces are still run by acting governors. The country recently had a $500 million budget shortfall and domestic revenues missed targets by 26 percent, forcing the U.S. to step in in recent months to help cover the fiscal gap. More than a third of Afghans live below the poverty line and the nation's vast mineral resources remain virtually untapped. Afghanistan also is not at peace, and Ghani's efforts to lure the Taliban to reconciliation talks have not yet been fruitful. Just hours before he spoke, at least six people were killed and more than 30 were wounded in a suicide car bombing near the presidential palace in Kabul. Ghani is untested as a leader, yet he received a warm reception from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. The reason: He's not Karzai. Expressed Gratitude: Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expresses his country's gratitude for America's fiscal commitment, military sacrifices, and last but not least corned beef from Katz's Deli.

Pope Francis has said that he will only continue as pontiff for 'another two or three years', adding: 'I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time.' As he completed his second year in the Catholic Church's top job, Francis said that he had 'a vague sensation' he would not reign as pope for long. He told the Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he had the feeling his reign would be brief and perhaps only two or three years, suggesting it was like the psychology of a gambler who convinces himself he'll lose so he won't be disappointed if he wins. He added: 'It is a somewhat vague sensation. But I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time, and nothing more.' The mysterious premonition will inevitably spark concerns about Francis' health. Francis is missing part of one lung after a childhood illness and suffers from sciatica. Last year he said that he believed he had only a few years to live. He said: 'I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then... to the house of the Father.' As he enters the beginning of his third year as pope, Francis sounded weary of the weight that comes with the job. He said that he didn't mind being pope, but that it had been hard work to change his habit of moving around at will. He said: 'The only thing I would like is to go out one day, without being recognised, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza.' Francis also confirmed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties, but rejected the idea of an age limit. Pope Francis has his confession heard during a Penitence Mass at St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican today. Pope Francis gives confession during the penitential celebration today. His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February 2013. Francis said 'Benedict should not be considered an exception, but an institution.' Also on Friday, Pope Francis marked the second anniversary of his election by declaring a jubilee year that will be interpreted as a powerful signal of his commitment to reforming the Church. The extraordinary holy year, dedicated to the theme of mercy, has been called to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a groundbreaking Vatican council that transformed how the Church related to the modern world, most notably ending the obligation for religious services to be conducted in Latin. The jubilee year will begin on December 8 and run until November 20, 2016. Francis leads a penitential ceremony at the Vatican, where he announced the Roman Catholic Church will mark an extraordinary Holy Year in December. Francis also confirmed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties, but rejected the idea of an age limit."}

Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday. Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city. The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack. The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to \u00a0pummel her with a large stone. The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair. He is of slim build. The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop. Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught. Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault. The unidentified man then left his victim for dead. Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot. Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari. The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week. The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday. 'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released. 'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his earlies twenties, slim, with receding black hair. 'He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood.' Anyone knows any information about the brutal attack is urged to call West Yorkshire Police."}
{"abstract": "Mobile phone bills are set to decrease after Ofcom ordered telecoms companies to reduce the cost of cross-network calls. This will benefit customers making calls from a fixed line, particularly the elderly. Mobile operators have expressed disappointment over the decision, and may increase other charges to make up for the reduction.", "article": "Mobile phone bills should begin to fall after a watchdog ordered telecoms companies to slash the cost of calling another network. For years, mobile users have faced extra charges for so-called 'cross-network' calls to friends, family and colleagues who have a different provider. The charges, known as the'mobile termination rate', is passed on to the customer who made the call, but also affect calls made from landline operators such as BT and TalkTalk. For years, mobile users have faced extra charges for so-called 'cross-network' calls to friends, family and colleagues who have a different provider. At the moment, these charges add 0.826 pence a minute to the usual cost of calls. However, Ofcom said yesterday that operators must slash them by more than 40 per cent over the next two years. By April 2017, mobile companies will be allowed to only charge 0.475 pence per minute extra. Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: 'This is a good thing for the consumer. The main benefit will be to customers making calls from a fixed line, where fees are stubbornly high\u2026 so it is particularly good for the elderly.' Ofcom research has shown that older customers tend to use landlines much more than younger people. According to official figures, the vast majority of the population \u2013 93 per cent \u2013 owns a mobile, and around three-quarters have both a landline and a mobile. Last year, around 16 per cent of adults in the UK relied solely on their mobile, and did not have a landline at all. Mobile operators have spent years lobbying to keep the mobile termination rate in place, helping to fatten their profits. The rates have been steadily reduced since the 1990s, when they were as high as 25p per minute, as mobile technology became more efficient and costs to the networks fell. However, yesterday the network operators expressed disappointment over Ofcom's decision to cut them further, and issued a veiled threat they could increase other charges to make up for the reduction. Last year, around 16 per cent of adults in the UK relied solely on their mobile, and did not have a landline. A spokesman for EE said: 'The proposed implementation puts at risk future investments and our ability to offer customers the lowest possible prices.' A telecoms source said that mobile phone companies would not be able to offer the same level of service if they do not get as much income from customers. Operators would face a choice to either allow the standards of their network and customer services to slip, or to recoup the money they have lost by increasing charges elsewhere. A spokesman for O2 added: 'There's no such thing as a free lunch. Mobile operators invest billions of pounds in their networks. The cost of handling calls from other operators comes at a cost and needs to be recovered from those operators.' Mr Howett said: 'The charges are based on the old-world of ancient switch networks. [It is time to ask] whether the system is still relevant'. Mobile operators, however, said they were pleased that Ofcom has given them two years to reduce the charges, as they had feared they would have to slash them overnight. David Hickson, of the consumer campaign group, Fair Telecoms, predicted that Ofcom would continue slashing the charges for cross-network calls. 'Landline users have effectively been subsidising mobile users for years. That has to go away,' he said. Mr Howett added that Ofcom would keep pressure on mobile companies to pass as much of the savings as possible to customers."}

And after that unfortunate incident after just 63 seconds, City cruised to a 3-0 win to trim Chelsea's lead at the top to three points. Arsenal stayed in touch as Olivier Giroud scored twice at Newcastle United, while Harry Kane grabbed his first Premier League hat-trick in Tottenham's 4-3 win over Leicester City. There were also wins for West Ham, Swansea, Southampton and Crystal Palace. Each week, Sportsmail collates the ratings of our reporters around the grounds to bring you the Premier League team of the day. GOALKEEPER - Boaz Myhill (Manchester City vs WEST BROM) 8. Down to 10 men after just two minutes against a City side determined to prove a point after a recent slump, West Brom were really up against it. Myhill led the resistance with a succession of excellent saves, in the end limiting the damage to just three goals. West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill gets a grip on Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero. DEFENCE - Jores Okore (ASTON VILLA vs Swansea City) 7. The Denmark international produced one of the more positive performances as Aston Villa slumped to a disappointing home defeat at the hands of Swansea. Jores Okore tussles with Bafetimbi Gomis during Saturday's match at Villa Park. DEFENCE - Ashley Williams (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA CITY) 7. At the opposite end, Williams and his central defensive partner Federico Fernandez produced assured performance to earn a clean sheet and keep the Swans in the top half of the table. Swansea captain Ashley Williams talks to Bafetimbi Gomis during their 1-0 win at Villa Park. DEFENCE - John O'Shea (West Ham vs SUNDERLAND) 7. After the early withdrawal of Wes Brown through injury, O'Shea stepped up and drew on his extensive leadership to marshal the Sunderland defence. Alas, they couldn't quite hold out and claim a precious point in Dick Advocaat's first game in charge. John O'Shea attempts to block an effort from West Ham's Diafra Sakho. DEFENCE - Neil Taylor (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA) 7.5. A hard-fought win for Swansea in which Taylor's block of a close-range Gabriel Agbonlahor effort early in the second-half proved crucial. Taylor also delivered plenty of crosses from the left, setting up Bafetimbi Gomis, who would later prove Swansea's match-winner. Neil Taylor slides in on Aston Villa's Leandro Bacuna during Swansea's win at Villa Park. MIDFIELD - Charlie Adam (STOKE CITY vs Crystal Palace) 7.5. Was his usual dogged self in the Stoke midfield but couldn't inspire a victory as Palace emerged from the Britannia with all three points. Charlie Adam slides in on Jason Puncheon during Stoke's defeat to Crystal Palace. MIDFIELD - David Silva (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8.5. The outstanding player in City's comfortable win over West Brom, which cut Chelsea's lead to three points - at least temporarily. The Spaniard tormented the Baggies defence throughout and scored City's third goal when he turned in Stevan Jovetic's shot. David Silva shoots for goal during Manchester City's win over West Brom on Saturday. MIDFIELD - Nabil Bentaleb (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 7.5. A crazy game at White Hart Lane but Bentaleb stood out for his performance in the Spurs midfield, protecting the defence and picking passes to free the front-runners. Was fortunate the referee didn't spot a slap on Leonardo Ulloa, however. Nabil Bentaleb holed off a challenge from Leicester's Matthew James during Saturday's 4-3 win. FORWARD - Wilfried Bony (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8. A day to savour for the Ivorian, who opened his account for Manchester City with a well-taken goal after 27 minutes. Having been involved in the game-changing sending off after just two minutes, Bony broke the deadlock with a neat flick turn and finish. Wilfried Bony celebrates after opening the scoring in City's 3-0 home win over West Brom. FORWARD - Olivier Giroud (Newcastle United vs ARSENAL) 8. A striker in a real purple patch, Giroud continued his hot streak with a double up at Newcastle to take his run to nine in his last nine matches. His first may have been a fortuitous deflection on Danny Welbeck's header but his second was an effortless header.

{"abstract": "The article discusses the issue of child labor in the Anlong Pi rubbish dump near Siem Reap, Cambodia, where tourists visit to take photos of the children working and hand out sweets. It highlights the desperate conditions of the workers, including the toxic fumes and lack of education, and criticizes the practice of tourists visiting the dump to take photos and use the children as entertainment. The article also features interviews with some of the children, who explain their experiences of working at the dump.", "article": "It is one of Cambodia's most popular tourist cities, where visitors flock to visit the nearby ruined temples of the Angkor region. But while foreign visitors stay in luxury hotels and splash out of escorted trips to discover the delights of 12th-century temple Angkor Wat, families work in a rubbish dump just 18.6 miles away for a meager \u00a31 a day. And now the rubbish site itself has piqued the curiosity of tourists, who have added a morbid visit of the site to their tour itineraries, so they can snap photos with the children working to sort the rubbish. Sigen Rathy is 12 years old. She has worked at the site for a year and has seen many tour groups passing through the landfill site to photograph what they see. A Japanese tourist covers her mouth with her hands due to the strong smell caused by the mountains of toxic waste and decaying food. The desperate photos showing the hard life of adults and children living and working at the site were taken by Spanish filmmaker David Rengel, who visited the area to document child labour conditions in the country. But the director was further shocked when he saw groups of tourists visiting the rubbish site to see the locals at work, take photos of the children and hand out sweets. Anlong Pi is a huge wasteland, just outside the popular tourist hub of Siem Reap. Workers are the extensive rubbish dump breathe toxic fumes on a daily basis as they work and live at the site. Lia Neang Syer is 14 years old. She has worked at the dump for four years and had to give up her studies because she had no money to pay for books and extra lessons. She has two sisters and one younger brother. Their mother also works at the garbage dump. She does not like the job but she is forced because her family need the money to live. Viku Tupse is nine years old and has lived at the rubbish dump for two years. Among the rubbish found a broken face of Mickey, he told Rengel knows that it will entertain the tourists when he places it on his head. He does not understand why tourists visit the garbage dump where he works, but he likes the sweets that tourists give him. In recent years, the huge increase in Siem Reap's population - in part to deal with the influx of tourists - has caused an exponential increase in the amount of rubbish taken to the dump site - causing even worse conditions for workers. Local organisations have also noticed an increase in the number of tourists visiting to site out of curiosity, to photograph the poverty-stricken locals working to sort the rubbish. Rengel explained: 'I went to Siem Reap, where my colleague and friend Omar Havana, a freelance photographer for Getty images, had been developing a project over various years. He gave me the contacts I needed to enter the site. 'While I was taking photos to demonstrate the realities of child labour, I realised tourists were arriving to visit, sometimes in buses and other times in tuk-tuks, Cambodian taxis, I thought it was horrible, and it should be reported. 'In that moment, I changed my point of view and instead decided to report on the practice of tourism as one of the causes of slave labour, including child labour.' A group of tourists watch Sueun Chany, 12, carrying large bags of trash across the dump for sorting. The landfill is located a few kilometers from Siem Reap, the most famous tourist destination in Cambodia. Kon Mai is 15 years old and has worked at the dump since he was 12. He had to leave school because his parents constantly are travelling from one place to another in search of work. He has five younger brothers and theer are reported problems of domestic violence at home. Hael Kemra is 15 years old. In the future she wants to be an English teacher. She began working at the dump at just 10 years old. Her mother was who took her to the garbage dump to earn money when her father abandoned them. While spending time talking to the 200 or so people living at the site, more of 50 of whom are children, Rengel realised the rubbish dump was being offered as an alternative kind of tour to the usual temple visits. He told MailOnline Travel: 'What disgusted me, what I didn't understand and what I don't think is understandable is why these tourist visit places where children work, or visit orphanages where children have lost their parents. 'It seems awful to me that tourists and people with money take part in this, from their position of privilege, show such contempt towards the inhabitants of the countries they visit and towards their human rights. 'What is the most contemptuous, what we shouldn't allow under any circumstances, is that they use children like a some kind of entertainment, violating all their human rights in the process.'

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture' (e) + 'letter' (moji). Icons. are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as. a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white. flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji. representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese. curry, and sushi. Some. emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them. to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as Facebook and Twitter. The keyboard is the latest in a long line of apps and services related to emoji. Last year a pair of London-based developers created the Emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images. Even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons. And with the release of iOS 8 Apple allowed app developers to create emoji-based keyboards for iPhones, iPads and iPhones. A study in April last year found that the top trending word, at that time, was emoji. There are now apps dedicated  to the small images. Emojli, for example, (pictured) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures, and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons."}

But, dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalk, engineers spotted problems with American astronaut Butch Wilmore's suit. While it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks, on Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out. Scroll down for video. Maintenance: Barry Wilmore and Terry Virts begin their third spacewalk at the International Space Station. Work: Astronaut Terry Virts installs an antenna and boom during the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station Sunday. Space Station: An astronaut is pictured at the International Space Station, the spacewalk is the third in eight days for NASA, and is the 187th in the history of the space station. Repair: Astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, right, and Terry Virts carried out the work but both had problems with their suits before their mission but none during the task. A mechanical gauge, however, was operating fine. Mission Control told Wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven-hour excursion. Meanwhile, Nasa said a small amount of water got into American astronaut Terry Virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized on Wednesday. They were forced to spend two days analyzing his suit after the water leak  occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week. Engineers concluded it was the result of condensation, and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit. Virts was never in danger, according to Nasa, so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks, Friday, to install cable. But in 2013, another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. Duties: NASA said another main part of the astronauts task was to route 400 feet (121 meters) of cable. Leak: In this file image made from video provided by Nasa, astronaut Terry Virts points to his helmet as he sits inside the International Space Station on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2015, during an inspection for water in his suit. Virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for Wednesday's spacewalk to formally conclude. Spacewalk:\u00a0Nasa on Friday cleared Virts' spacesuit, pictured, for the last of three spacewalks to install cable. Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk. The water escaped from his suit's cooling system and Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks. On Wednesday, the amount of water seepage in Virts' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when Virts was already inside. 'They're very different occurrences,' said Alex Kanelakos, a spacewalk officer in Mission Control. Cable: American astronauts Terry Virts and Butch Wilmore had 400 more feet of power and data cable, as well as two antennas which they installed Sunday. Astronaut: Terry Virts is seen during the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station Sunday\u00a0during the six hour, 45 minute outing, they plan to set up antennas and communications equipment. Nasa: Astronaut Terry Virts, left, and Barry Wilmore began the spacewalk at 6:52 am (1152 GMT) when completed the work will allow future crews launching from Florida on US commercial spacecraft to be able to park at the space station. The advance work, involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by Nasa. The work done by American astronauts Virts and Wilmore meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed, as well as two antennas installed on Sunday. A pair of docking ports will fly up later this year, followed by the capsules themselves, with astronauts aboard, in 2017. The astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions, on February 21 and last Wednesday. They carried out complicated work Sunday, yet the astronauts completed their task  an hour early  making it a five and a half-hour spacewalk. They spent 20 hours altogether on three outings. Neither Virts nor Wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task. Mission Control joked by radio: 'You guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots.' The 260-mile (418-kilometre) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world's first spacewalk by\u00a0Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov  on March 18, 1965. Nasa hasn't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days, and the amount of cable work is unprecedented.

{"abstract": "The upcoming speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress has caused a rift between the United States and Israel, with both sides accusing the other of endangering the future of the world. The disagreement is over the best way to head off Iran's nuclear ambitions, with the US favoring a compromise agreement and Israel wanting a total dismantling of Iran's nuclear program. Both sides should agree to a cease fire and respect each other's points of view in order to avoid serious, lasting damage.", "article": "(CNN)It's time for leaders in Israel and the United States to call off their war of insults before they cause serious, lasting damage.  Heading into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire. The speech itself is a terrible mistake.  Arranging it without prior consultation with the White House was not only an affront to Barack Obama but to the Presidency itself. One would have thought that after all the uproar, Netanyahu would have caught a \"cold\" and postponed, but now that he plans to go ahead, he should at least give a measured, thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known.  But let's be clear: he also deserves a respectful hearing in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in America as well as in Israel. This conflict began on a personal level. Those close to Obama and Netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another. Obama, they say, regards Netanyahu as headstrong, bombastic and reckless. Netanyahu sees Obama as weak, unreliable and priggish. The Obama team also accuses Netanyahu of timing his Congressional speech to rally Israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- Bibi as Churchill standing up to the Nazis -- while Netanyahu's team is convinced Obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the Nobel laureate who brought peace. Each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press. But in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off Iran's aggressive push to become a nuclear power.  The Iranian threat has long been vexing; former Defense Secretary Bob Gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security.  There are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties. The Obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with Iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart, risking an armed showdown.  The Netanyahu government believes the agreement which Obama appears ready to accept will let Iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb. In truth, there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement.  As Obama believes, a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear Iran. But what is alarming not only to Israel but to other American friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the U.S. and its partners in the negotiation with Iran (Russia, China, the UK, France, Germany) have made repeated concessions to get an Iranian signature without getting major concessions in return. Consider: The U.S. and Israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that Iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against Teheran.  Leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal, the U.S. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in Iran -- 6,500 by latest count. Washington and Tel Aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years. \u200b According to the latest leaks, the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the Iranians a chance to bust loose.  This is only the beginning of a long litany of differences. In defense of U.S. compromises, Secretary of State John Kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore, those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt. But administration critics are also right in arguing that the Obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace, an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the Middle East will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace. In times past, American and Israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress.  President Jimmy Carter could barely stand Israeli leader Menachem Begin but they and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shaped the Camp David accords in 1978. Despite sometimes bitter words during Israel's recent dust-up with Hamas -- especially directed by Israel against Secretary Kerry -- Obama ensured that Israel was well supplied militarily, particularly with the Iron Dome missile defense system that saved countless Israeli lives. But today's rift seems far more perilous.  It is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the Middle East.  Israel should remember that America is its best friend in a world where anti-Semitism is once again raising its hideous head.  The United States should appreciate that for Israel, a nuclear Iran could pose instant annihilation. America also has Arab friends in the Middle East who have vital interests here -- friends like Saudi Arabia who, if an agreement is weak, will"}

Last year, the PCS discussed the possibility of a merger with Unite, but the idea was shelved due to PCS members not wanting their union fees to contribute to Labour Party coffers.", "article": "A left-wing \u2018super-union\u2019 with almost 1.8million members could be created by a controversial merger of Labour\u2019s biggest donor Unite and the biggest civil service union after the election, senior Conservatives fear. They warn that a merger between the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and the Unite union would threaten the impartiality of Whitehall. Half of all civil servants are members of the PCS, which is not currently politically affiliated. If the two unions merged, they would effectively be subsumed into a union which is Labour\u2019s biggest financial supporter. Unite, which has donated millions to Labour since Ed Miliband became leader of the party, could be set to merge with the Public and Commercial Services Union. Unite is at least five times larger than PCS, which claims a membership of 270,000. Unite, which has made \u00a314.3million in donations to Labour since Ed Miliband became leader in 2010, has 1.42million members. A Conservative source said: \u2018A takeover of PCS by Labour\u2019s biggest donor, Unite, would make over half of all civil servants members of a Labour-affiliated union. \u2018PCS and Unite must come clean about their secret plans. No takeover can be permitted to imperil the perceived impartiality of the civil service.\u2019 The PCS has been in financial difficulty following cuts to the civil service, as well as an end to a system where Government departments automatically deducted union dues from the payroll. A leaked document suggests it plans to sell its headquarters to a private equity fund and suspend national elections for this year. The union blames its financial crisis on the downsizing of the civil service, now a fifth smaller than it was in 2010. The end of the \u2018check off system\u2019, which saw union fees deducted automatically from salaries by many Government departments has also squeezed the PCS. MPs have warned a left-wing merger between the PCS and Unite (Unite protest pictured) would threaten the impartiality of Whitehall. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has overseen the closure of this scheme at the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence. In addition, the Government has clamped down on so-called \u2018facility time\u2019, whereby union officials are paid by the taxpayer to work for a union. The overall cost of such taxpayer-subsidised union officials has fallen by more than two-thirds, while the number of full-time union officials paid for by the public purse has fallen from over 200 to fewer than ten. Last year, the PCS discussed the possibility of a merger with Unite at its annual conference, but the idea was shelved. A source at the PCS played down the prospect of the deal with Unite being revived, saying: \u2018It\u2019s no secret that we had informal discussions. These proposals were never driven by finances. Our conference voted against a motion from the national executive saying we should carry on exploring it, and said we should set more formal conditions. So it\u2019s not on the horizon.\u2019 Unite\u2019s general secretary Len McCluskey suggested last year there would be \u2018no further progress\u2019 on merger talks with the PCS unless it changed its membership rules. Hinting at the reasons for the breakdown of talks, he told delegates \u2018our rules don\u2019t change, our structures don\u2019t change\u2019. PCS members apparently insisted they would not back a new relationship with Unite if their union membership fees contributed to Labour Party coffers."}

For Maddie Munden a slice of toast in the morning is anything but a hasty breakfast grabbed on the way to work. The 41-year-old nibbles on up to 90 loaves a week, chewing her way through 50,000 slices of bread every single year in her job as an official toast tester in a Leeds supermarket. Ms Munden tastes bread to ensure it is suitable for sale, ranking loaves by their taste, density and smell. And despite spending her working day eating toast Ms Munden insists the aroma of a freshly baked loaf or toasted slice of bread is still 'the ultimate smell.' 'Some people can't believe it when I tell them I'm tasting bread on daily basis, sometimes solidly from 9 til 5, but it's when the baker in me really comes out and having been in the industry for over 25 years, not much gets past me - only the really great stuff,' said Ms Munden. And despite eating bread on a daily basis, Ms Munden manages to stay fit by eating fruit and vegetables as well as going for an odd run round the block. Ms Munden comes from a baking background and began working at just 16. Four years later Ms Munden was awarded Master Baker Status and now works for Asda in Leeds. She added: 'I spend every waking minute thinking lighter loaves, bouncy buns and trends in breakfast treats, but bread is still one of my favourite foods. 'One of the most important parts of my job is making sure that our customers are getting the best and tastiest loaves and with over 300 lines in the in-store bread category, it's a full time job. 'We look at the life of the products and the density - I can't bear a heavy loaf. 'To me the smell of toast or bread baking in the oven is the ultimate smell.' Ms Munden rarely eats a whole slice of toast, but instead usually takes a bite from the crust and centre to get the full texture. As part of her official tasting role, Ms Munden also has to keep on top of the latest trends in bread and toast. She said cornbread is one of the most popular varieties at the moment, as is a combination of healthy grains with white loaves. Ms Munden, who spends most days munching on toast, still insists that bread is her favourite smell. The tester has been in the baking industry for 25 years and said baking is more a way of life than a job. Ms Munden tastes dozens of slices of toast a day, but has managed to remain slim. She added: 'I try and stay fit by going mountain biking and also by doing the odd run around the block as often as I can. I also try and maintain a balanced diet, and eat a good mix of fruit and vegetables each week too.' And to add some variety to her tasting role, Ms Munden recently got to turn her hand to cookies. In an average week Ms Munden might nibble through up to 90 loaves to test their taste, smell and density. Ms Munden is involved in watching out for new bread trends as well as developing new products in store. She said: 'It was nice to take a break from testing toast and taste the new cookies instead. 'I love being able to use my imagination to develop something the UK shoppers have previously been unable to buy in store. That's my favourite part of the job - seeing someone in store walk away with one of my products and I know they're in for a treat. 'I enjoy baking as far more than just a job - it's a way of life.'"}

Scottish Mark who tips the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight. 'I feel restricted in what I can do, caged,' the father admitted. He said gastric bypass surgery, which costs \u00a39,000 on the NHS, is his only hope. 'I have always been a big guy. From the age of 13 a lot of drink and food. I reckon lager had a lot to do with the weight initially,' he explained. 'I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I have lost weight and it's the easiest thing in the world to put it back on. All I am looking for is help to keep it off by restricting what I can eat.' He says his problem with food is an addiction and he should be supported in the same way people are when they try to give up addictions to cigarettes and alcohol.

Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show NHS: \u00a32bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat. Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time. He can't afford to pay for the op privately as he was made redundant from his job at a delivery company two years ago and is now on benefits. He said: 'It all boils down to money. Your life means nothing if it costs too much.' He admitted he knows people watching will think he doesn't deserve to have the operation on the NHS. But in the long run, it could save NHS funds as they wouldn't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future. Professor David Kerrigan, a bariatric surgeon who treats both NHS and private patients, agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the NHS. He said: 'I know a lot of people won't have any sympathy for the sort of patients I treat but these people have real problems. They are not a little bit chubby wanting to look better, they are ill because of the obesity they developed. 'I don't care how or why they got it, I know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they can't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape. 'This surgery is transformative for people's lives, there are very few operations we do that can achieve that.' Marks added: 'If it stops me getting diabetes then it benefits me and them, those costs can then go somewhere else.' The show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the NHS to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater. There are children born with cerebral palsy who need\u00a0Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) - a procedure that can significantly reduce muscle stiffness helping them to walk more easily and reducing painful muscle spasms.

The app aims to inform consumers about the illegal deforestation of areas in Borneo and Sumatra, which is having a devastating impact on the animals that call these areas home.", "article": "A terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not-for-profit to 'watch your back' also included threats against the woman's daughter, claiming they knew where she went to school. Lordina Jane, President and Founder of Palm Oil Investigations (POI) discovered the harrowing letter on Tuesday, ahead of the release of the POI app on Wednesday evening. The free app - developed by the not-for-profit over the past 12 months - will inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products available on supermarket shelves. 'When I opened that letter I went cold... I took the letter and went straight to the police,' Lorinda told Daily Mail Australia. This anonymous letter was sent to Palm Oil Investigations (POI) President Lorina Jane threatening her, and her daughter and claiming to know where they live. 'It's a really gutless thing to do... The person who sent it has been that gutless they wouldn't put their name to it.' Lorinda is the founder and president of the not-for-profit  which provides information to consumers about products that contain palm oil. Coming from an anonymous source, the letter made claims that should their company feature 'unfavourably' in the new app, 'we will be your worst enemy'. 'We know you are soon to release a phone app about products with palm oil in,' the letter began. 'If our company is listed unfavourably we will be your worst enemy. 'If our listing has a negative effect on our company, we know where you live, we know you have a daughter and we know where she goes to school. You will both need to watch your back,' it continued. 'You have bragged online that your app will be a \u2018game changer\u2019, it well may be only not how you expect,' the letter concluded,. Lorinda said in the years since the POI launched their Facebook page - which has over 144,000 'likes' - they have never encouraged any consumers to boycott particular brands, but are about simply providing information. The letter, which was printed and not handwritten, and featured no company markings, is the first of its kind according to the POI founder. Lorinda believes it could have come from a smaller brand they have contacted in the process of putting together their app - which acts as a barcode scanner and puts products into five categories. The threats came a day ahead of the release of the POI app, which aims to inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products they consume. The first category is palm oil free, the second indicates the company has signed on to stop deforestation, the third is palm oil certified - which means they use ethically sourced oil, the fourth is for companies or products which used a mixed supply of certified and uncertified oil, and the final is a fail. A fail means the company have refused to provide details when approached by POI, or that they use uncertified palm oil. 'It is going to make big waves,' Lorinda said, speaking of the app. 'I don\u2019t know what this person or company thinks they\u2019re going to achieve. It's not the correct way to approach us'. 'Whoever it is is worried\u2026 in a way that\u2019s a good thing because it shows the app is going to do exactly what it\u2019s meant to,' she continued. In recent years there has been controversy over illegal deforestation in south-east Asia. Animals such as orangutans, tigers and elephants are losing their natural habitats to the deforestation. As a single mother to her young daughter, the POI founder said the letter was frightening, and it was now being investigated by detectives. And she had a message for the anonymous sender: 'If they\u2019re worried, why not send us a letter and say how are our brands sitting in that app \u2026 instead of sending something like that'. A controversial ingredient in recent years, palm oil is used in a large amount of products found on supermarket shelves, from foods to beauty and cleaning products. The issue surrounding the resource stems from the illegal deforestation of areas in Borneo and Sumatra, which is having a devastating impact on the animals that call these areas home. Orangutans, tigers,\u00a0rhinoceroses and elephants are among the native animals which face extinction as more and more land is cleared to harvest the cheap oil. Harvesting the crops from which the oil comes from is not the issue at the centre of the debate, rather the uncertified and dangerous ways the resource is being collected and sold."}

The pair have been hailed as heroes after risking their own lives to jump into shark-infested waters where a man was drowning. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15, and Payge Olds, 16, were helping their friend tow his car near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night when they heard a man scream for help. Without thinking, the group rushed 300m down the beach to the scene where Payge managed to undress the fastest and swim 70 metres out to sea to rescue the  man. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15 (left), and Payge Olds, 16 (right) risked their own lives on Monday night when they saved a drowning man in Wellington Harbour. 'We all thought it was a prank at first because this kind of thing doesn't really happen,' Payge, from Lower Hutt in Wellington told Daily Mail Australia. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek, \u00a0who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it. He saw the man floating face down in the water unconscious. Mr Derek, who was unable to swim, alerted the group to the man in the water, with the hope that one of them would be a capable swimmer. 'I was the last one there and everyone else was undressed and ready to jump in the water but no one had jumped in yet because none of them are comfortable swimmers so I ended up just stripping off to my underwear and then jumping in,' Payge said. The two teenagers were helping their friend tow his car after it got stuck on the beach. The incident happened near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night. Payge said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her. 'I wasn't expecting to get that far,' she said of the distance she swam out to sea. 'At the time I didn't really think about it. I just thought you know what there's a man out there suffering, I need to get to him and help him. 'Now I'm really proud of myself and I'm happy that I was there.' Police released images of the man unconscious and lying in his hospital bed an appealed for public help to identify him. The man appeared to be aged in his 30s and from a South Asian background. Police said the man was dressed but had no identificatoin on him, The Dominion Post reported. 'Unfortunately, due to his condition, police has been unable to speak with him and he was not carrying any identification that could help us find out who he is,' Detective Sergeant Grant Corroll said, appealing for anyone who recognises him to contact police. 'Given his critical stauts, time is of the essence,' he said. Even the murky water and it's inhabitants didn't stop the courageous teenager from jumping head-first into the harbour. Payge (right) said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her. 'There's eels and multiple other things in there,' she said. 'Sometimes we do get sharks and whales  and stingrays but I didn't really think about that. Well I did but I tried to avoid that thought.' Two men, who were sitting on the rocks on the harbours edge, shone torches on the water so Payge would be able to see where she was going. The teenager said she was terrified she would be too late and that she would lose the man in the dark. 'My worst fear was that he wasn't there any more and that I was just too late,' she said. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek, who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it. 'Eventually I came across him and he was kind of floating. He was sinking but he was just on the surface. 'If I has been any longer I would have completely lost him and I would not have been able to find him.' According to Payge, the man had an Indian appearance and weighed between 70 and 80kg. She said both her and her cousin thought he was in his late 30s to early 40s. 'I got there and I couldn't lift him, he was so much bigger than me,' Payge said. Payge  began to panic and started screaming for someone to help her. After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay(right) began performing"}

{"abstract": "Rumors of a coup in Moscow have been circulating due to the nine day absence of Vladimir Putin from public sight. Former FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev is believed to be behind the plot, and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has suggested that forces are scheming to overthrow Putin. Pictures of Putin supposedly working during his absence have been called into question, and other senior Kremlin cardinals have remained silent.", "article": "Vladimir Putin is 'alive' but 'neutralised' as shadowy security chiefs stage a stealthy coup in Moscow, it was claimed last night. Former FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev was behind the plot, claimed chairman of the pro-Kremlin national Islamic Committee, Geydar Dzhemal. There have been no confirmed sightings of Putin for nine days, while in the febrile atmosphere engulfing Moscow a convoy of large trucks parked outside the Kremlin fueled rumours of a flit by the president. Scroll down for video. Russian president Vladimir Putin has not been seen in public for the past nine days fueling coup rumours. Putin, left, supposedly met the chairman of the supreme court Vyacheslav Lebedev, right, on Friday, however, it is now thought the video footage released by Putin loyalists may have been several years old. In fact, the lorries close to St Basil's Cathedral were more likely connected to a nationalist celebration of the first anniversary of the return of Crimea to Russia - seen by Putin's supporters as his ultimate masterstroke. Despite this, bloggers likened it to Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych's treasure-grab as he fled into exile just over a year ago in Kiev. 'I think that Putin is neutralised at the moment, but of course, he is alive,' said Dzhemal, seen as a Kremlin loyalist. 'He is under the control of the power-wielding agencies, who have, in my opinion, organised a coup d'etat.' Recent pictures of Putin supposedly working during a nine day absence from public sight was 'playing for time' by the plotters, he claimed. 'My information is that Patrushev met Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in Pyatigorsk on 11 March and tempted him over to his side.' He also pointed to a recent visit by Patrushev - head of Putin's security council - the US. The visit came despite sanctions barring visits by most senior Russian officials. 'I think he was offered something there that he failed to reject,' said Dzhemal on Georgian TV channel Rustavi-2. Several large trucks were parked near Kremlin Square fueling rumours connected with Putin's absence. Putin has not been seen in public for nine days which has caused certain consternation in Russia. Putin failed to reappear again on Saturday - the ninth day without a confirmed sighting - as his Chechen enforcer suggested the Russian strongman is in danger of being overthrown. Ramzan Kadyrov - a devout Muslim whose security apparatchiks are seen as being behind the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov - said he would remain devoted to the Kremlin leader 'whether he is in his position or not'. This came amid a claim that pictures issued by the Kremlin on Friday of Putin meeting Supreme Court head Vyachevslav Lebedev may date from 2011. The images were rushed out in a bid to show Putin is still at work, and followed the release of other photographs which had been taken on or before 5 March when he was last seen in public. With feverish speculation in Moscow over Putin's health and whereabouts, and claims of a bitter power struggle in his entourage which could even trigger an attempted coup, the head of Chechnya spoke emotionally of people 'trying to harm the president of Russia - and Russia itself'. And he claimed that forces were scheming 'to break us apart', referring to him and his guarantor Putin. As startling has been the lack of shows of support in recent days from other senior Kremlin cardinals during an absence which has no obvious parallel in his 15 years as president or premier. The voices of prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Chief of the Kremlin staff Sergei Ivanov - and Putin's intelligence tsars - have remained silent. Kadyrov has enjoyed extraordinary power and largesse under Putin as a reward for keeping an iron grip on the rebellious oil-rich Chechen region, scene of two bloody wars since the collapse of the USSR. As a result he is hated by many senior Putin loyalists. But Kadyrov's enemies claimed yesterday that the 38 year old bearded regional potentate is in 'panic' because he can no longer contact his mentor. 'He is phoning anyone he can in an attempt to arrange a talk with Putin - but he fails,' alleged a website linked to Islamic hardliners seeking to overthrow Kadyrov. One of the two men formally charged with killing opposition leader Boris Nemtsov is a personal friend of Kadyrov, who spoke out in his support for the second time yesterday. 'I'll repeat now that I knew him as a true warrior and patriot,' he said of Zaur Dadayev, who is accused of murder. There are allegations that a security official closer to Kadyrov ordered the Nemtsov murder, and that the FSB and Interior Ministry in Moscow have full proof. His slaying has triggered bitter factional infighting in the Kremlin, which includes talk of"}

And the Dutchman will focus his attentions on landing proven international talent, rather than high-risk, big-money youngsters, that have become a feature of the club's transfer policy in recent seasons. United spent close to \u00a3150million on the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria last summer - deals that have not gone as well as expected. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is planning to spend big money on proven talent this summer. United spent close to \u00a3150m on the likes of Radamel Falcao (above) - one deal that has not gone as expected. Nevertheless, as long as United qualify for next season's Champions League, the Old Trafford money-men will sanction another \u00a3100m-plus transfer splurge to help turn the club into realistic title contenders again. And Van Gaal will continue to focus his attentions on high-profile deals, rather than unproven potential, despite having his fingers burned by Falcao and Di Maria. United signed a clutch of young talent in recent seasons as the club look to build for the future. Borussia Dortmund defender and World Cup winner Mats Hummels, 26, is a prime target at Old Trafford. Juventus midfeidler and former United youngster Paul Pogba is also on Van Gaal's radar. But the strategy has not proved as fruitful as they'd hoped. And Van Gaal will target players he feels are in their prime and can hit the ground running. Borussia Dortmund defender and World Cup winner Mats Hummels, 26, is a prime target, as is Holland international Memphis Depay. Juventus star Paul Pogba, widely regarded as one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the world, is also on United's radar. Kevin Strootman (right) has been a long-time target of United but has suffered injury problems. Holland international and PSV star\u00a0Memphis Depay (right) could be heading to Old Trafford. United have a long-standing interest in Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman, 25, but a serious knee injury has thrown a potential move to Old Trafford into doubt. Van Gaal has a major interest in Gareth Bale but the Wales international wants to stay at Real Madrid, as Sportsmail\u00a0revealed this morning. Porto's Danilo, who is valued at \u00a330m, is a target as Van Gaal looks for a new right back. But the Brazil international is set for a move to Real Madrid, meaning United have turned their attentions to England's first choice right-back Nathaniel Clyne or Barcelona star Dani Alves. The Dutch boss has a major interest in Gareth Bale but the Real Madrid star wants to stay in Spain. Porto's Danilo, who is valued at \u00a330million, is a target as Van Gaal looks for a new right-back. The illustrious list indicates the calibre of player United are intent on signing this summer as they look to re-establish themselves among Europe's elite. A string of expensive young signings have not progressed as expected in recent seasons, a failure that has not gone unnoticed by Van Gaal. And the Dutchman wants to avoid similar mistakes this summer. With Danilo set for a move to Madrid, United will turn their attentions to Nathaniel Clyne (left) Van Gaal may also bring Barcelona defender Dani Alves (centre) to Manchester. The \u00a315m capture of Wilfried Zaha in January 2013 has turned out to be a disaster, likewise the signing of Alex Buttner in the summer of 2012 was one to forget. The jury is still out on the \u00a331.5m signing of Luke Shaw last summer, while the captures of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling - who cost a combined total of \u00a326m - have also been questioned. The jury is still out on the \u00a331.5m signing of former Southampton youngster Luke Shaw."}

After concluding the press conference, Pearson muttered 'waxing away, my a***' under his breath. He was then further angered by the suggestion his team\u2019s season was \u2018waxing or waning\u2019 with ten games left and seven points separating Leicester from safety. \u2018Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***,\u2019 Pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the King Power Stadium. As he gets up he appears to utter the word: \u2018P****.\u2019 Pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters. Pearson does not countenance such dark arts. In a December interview he said: 'People who are more cynical-minded might say I\u2019m naive. 'There is a concern at the Premier League about the number of times that is happening. I hope my players don\u2019t start doing it. 'There\u2019s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win. I\u2019d never cheat to win.' He is fiercely protective of his squad and, in any case, replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of Hull players arguing the opposite. The Leicester manager then seemed to call the journalist a 'p****' for the line of questioning. Pearson looks frustrated during another game where his Leicester side failed to win. It is a third controversial incident for Pearson this season. In December he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined \u00a310,000 for telling a supporter to \u2018f*** off and die\u2019 after receiving sustained abuse. In February he was involved in a touchline exchange with James McArthur as the pair fell together. Pearson jokingly throtted the Crystal Palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play. The next day brought Pearson\u2019s phantom sacking, when Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son Aiyawatt counselled against. Bruce\u2019s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on Saturday evening. The Hull manager said: \u2018There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I\u2019ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. \u2018For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make. The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we\u2019re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it\u2019s not right.\u2019 Pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion, and swearing under his breath. Steve Bruce cited Chelsea in terms of the Leicester players behaved to try and get Alex Bruce sent off\u2026. Did they? Oh very nice. Do you think that\u2019s a fair criticism? No. What\u2019s your take on that situation? I\u2019ve just said no. But what\u2019s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee? How many times have you seen us play this year? Three times. Well there you are then. You\u2019re not in a position to judge my players on that. I\u2019m not judging anyone. I\u2019m just asking you\u2026. You\u2019ve asked me and I\u2019ve told you. No was the answer. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair assessment. Full stop. Do you consider that Leicester\u2019s season is waxing or waning? I don\u2019t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We\u2019ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That\u2019s it.

The win puts Arsenal four points behind second-placed Manchester City in the race for a top-four finish.", "article": "For once the north London spotlight didn't fall on Arsenal this Sunday afternoon. After the week they've had, Arsene Wenger would have been happy to shun the limelight this time. Ask Gunners fans prior to kick-off if they'd rather three points or a Spurs loss in the Capital One Cup final and you'd have been greeted with split responses. Olivier Giroud connects with a corner to fire Arsenal in front in the first half as they continue their bid for a top-four finish. Giroud watches as the ball heads for goal as Arsenal take the lead against Everton who were suffering from their European exertions. Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard can only stand and watch, along with the rest of his defence, as the ball trundles into the net. Giroud, content that the ball will cross the line, turns away to celebrate as Howard makes a late but unsuccessful attempt to stop it. In the end, as arch-rivals Tottenham prepared for their date with destiny at Wembley, the Gunners got their win, courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky, to move four points behind second-placed Manchester City. But much like their demoralising Champions League loss to Monaco on Wednesday night, this didn't make for comfortable viewing. The 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the full story. Everton dominated large spells of this clash - the Emirates Stadium a bag or nerves until Rosicky's last minute goal. Nevertheless, while their participation in this year's Champions League is under huge threat, their qualification for next year's competition is firmly on course thanks to this win. Wenger rang the changes following Wednesday's hugely disappointing loss. Vice captain Per Mertesacker and Danny Welbeck were axed following the loss to Monaco and replaced by Gabriel and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. For Gabriel, in particular, it was a huge chance to cement himself in his manager's first-team plans. Mertesacker's role in the starting XI has been called into huge question this season following a string of below-par displays.\u00a0And it seems Wenger's reached the end of his tether with the German World Cup winner after another disappointing display in midweek. Giroud struggled in Arsenal's midweek defeat by Monaco but showed his delight at the Emirates after firing the Gunners in front. Giroud points to the heavens after scoring (left) and points to his temple as if to urge Arsenal to maintain their concentration.

Jedinak had until 6pm on Tuesday night to appeal against the charge - a move which would have made him available to face Southampton - but he decided to accept it at the risk of a lengthier ban for a frivolous appeal. As the 30-year-old Australian has already been sent off this season - against Sunderland - he has been given a four-match ban, the FA confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. Mile Jedinak's elbow clearly makes contact with the face of Diafra Sakho after the ball had gone. As well as missing the trip to Southampton on Tuesday night, Jedinak is banned for Palace's home match against QPR on March 14, an away fixture at Stoke on March 21 and Manchester City's visit to Selhurst Park on April 6.

The ultra-Aussie confection is just one of the weird and wacky flavours being concocted by an adventurous, multi-award winning, ice-cream connoisseur. Dooley's Ice Cream parlour in Apollo Bay, on Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, is known for producing some of the oddest combinations in ice-cream - and its Vegemite flavour may be the strangest yet. Owner Dooley Milner told Daily Mail Australia the flavour is a massive hit with international tourists and 'gets people talking'. Dooley's Ice Cream Parlour on the Great Ocean Road has released a Vegemite flavour. But others are not so keen, saying the black, salty yeast byproduct is not well suited to ice cream. Dooley's, which has won 370 awards for excellence, often creates unique flavours in the run-up to special events. Just before Christmas, Dooley's made a Xmas Pudding flavour and for Australia Day the shop made a Lamington flavour. But it's Vegemite  that has stood the test of time. The parlour first introduced the unique ice-cream on Australia Day in 2011 and it has been on the shelves ever since. In 2012, it won a silver award at the Royal Melbourne Show and the parlour's vanilla flavour has been voted the number one ice-cream in Australia at the Australian Grand Dairy Awards 2015. 'I've stuck with it since. It has been received quite well.' Mr Milner said. The famous shop, which is visited each day by hundreds of tourists, has a range of odd flavours on display. 76-year-old Dooley Milner has been running the parlour for the past 14 years and his daughter Alyciandra came on-board in 2007.

This Lamington flavour was made available for Australia Day. The ice-cream parlour has won over 370 awards for it's range of different flavours. While Mr Milner said the ice-cream tastes of Vegemite, there have been some critics of the acquired flavour online. A commenter on Reddit wasn't impressed with the potent flavour while others claimed they were desperate to try it. 'Not good....the taste was too strong,' the user said. Another commenter was desperate to taste the flavour, telling other users he wouldn't mind if it's wasn't nice. While people are eager to queue up to taste the unique product, there have been some critics of the Vegemite flavour online. Dooley's owner Mr Milner said he will continue selling the Vegemite flavour ice-cream as it's a conversation starter among the many curious tourists who pass his shop everyday on the Great Ocean Road.

{"abstract": "The 70-year split between North and South Korea has caused the language to diverge, with South Koreans incorporating English words and phrases while North Koreans have eliminated foreign words and created homegrown substitutes. This has caused misunderstandings between the two countries, with North Korean defectors struggling to understand the South's English-based words and South Koreans confused by North Korean words. The two countries also have different spelling and pronunciation rules for some Korean words, leading to further confusion.", "article": "Seven decades of separation has seen even the language of North and South Korea split into two different dialects. The two countries, though enemies, are tied together by history, by family and by language - but only to a point. South Koreans have incorporated many English words and phrases into their language while isolated communist North Korea has eliminated words with foreign origins and created homegrown substitutes. North Korean defector Pak Mi-ok ended up going without water during a meal in the South because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand the term'self-service' For those south of the divide, English-based words like'shampoo,' 'juice' and'self-service' are common. But they mean absolutely nothing to defectors from the insular North Korea. When Pak Mi-ok first arrived in South Korea after her defection in 2002, she was told by a waitress at a restaurant that water was'self-service,' an English phrase she had not heard before. She ended up going without water during her meal because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand. 'I worried the waitress would look down on me,' she told the Associated Press. She started out working at restaurants but struggled to understand customers. 'I thought they spoke a different language,' she said. But she gradually picked up the new vocabulary and uses words like'stress' and 'claim' that are not heard up in the North. Similarly, people in Seoul are confused by homegrown North Korean words like'salgyeolmul,' which literally translates to'skin water' - but is just 'lotion' in the South. The Korean Peninsula's 70-year split has created a widening linguistic divide that produces misunderstandings, hurt feelings and sometimes even laughter. The North's isolation near-worship of the ruling Kim family (pictured centre, leader Kim Jong-un) has also skewed the language. The gap has grown so wide that about a third of everyday words used in the two countries are different, according to scholars. North and South Koreans are generally able to understand each other given that the majority of words and grammar are still the same. But the differences show how language can change when one half of the country becomes an international economic powerhouse and the other isolates itself, suspicious of outside influences. The huge cultural influence of America through its military presence, business ties and Hollywood has flooded the South Korean vernacular with words borrowed from English. 'Konglish' uses English words in non-standard ways, like 'handle' for steering wheel, 'hand phone' for cellphone and'manicure' for nail polish. In North Korea's view, this is just further evidence that the South is an American cultural colony. The North's isolation and near-worship of the ruling Kim family has also skewed the language. South Koreans use the English loan word 'juice' but North Koreans say 'danmul,' or'sweet water.' South Koreans watch a'musical' but North Koreans see a 'gamuiyagi,' or'music and dance story.' 'Suryong' is the revered title for North's founding leader and his son, but in the South it's a historical term referring to a medieval regional or faction leader. The sea creatures that South Koreans call 'cuttlefish' are known in North Korea by the word South Koreans use for 'octopus.' The term 'elderly person' is considered neutral in the North, but pejorative in the South. South Koreans wash their hair with'shampoo' but North Koreans use'meorimulbinu,' or 'hair water soap.' The word 'dongmu' is used in North Korea to refer to a revolutionary colleague, but South Koreans seldom use the term. A 'dosirak' is South Korean word for a lunch box while North Koreans call it 'gwakbab.' South Koreans use the English loan phrase'skin lotion' but it's'salgyeolmul,' or'skin water' in the North. North and South Korea have different spelling and pronunciation rules for the first syllable of some Korean words, so the common family name is 'Lee' in the South but 'Ri' in the North. South Koreans often end their conversations with phrases like 'Let's have lunch someday' or 'Let's go out for drinks soon,' but North Korean defectors who have just arrived often take those as literal invitations and expect a follow-up phone call to arrange the appointment. Source: AP. 'Suryong' is the revered title for the North's founding leader and his son, Kim Jong Il, the father of the current ruler, Kim Jong Un. But in the South it's used to refer to a faction or local leader from centuries ago. Misunderstandings can arise to seemingly innocuous Korean phrases like, 'Let's do lunch sometime,' which those in the South frequently use as a friendly ending to conversations, even with casual acquaintances. But newly arrived North Korean defectors take such invitations literally"}
{"abstract": "The new 'common sense' approach to parking rules by the Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will end the 'war on the motorist' and restore fairness and balance to the system.

These changes will benefit both drivers and local businesses, allowing shoppers to enjoy their local high street without worrying about parking wardens.", "article": "In the history of human invention, there's nothing that matches the car. We rely on them every day. To do our jobs, drop the kids off at school, or take an elderly relative shopping. Cars mean freedom and independence, and most importantly of all, convenience. But years of crazy parking rules have made many law-abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses. We all know the story. You return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen. Or maybe you run a local shop, and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee. Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) have vowed to end the 'war on the motorist' with their new 'common sense' approach. In 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end. That meant not only changing the rules, but changing attitudes, because under the previous Government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny, treating them like cash machines on wheels. This included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives. Where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post. If you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine, or an angry bailiff knocking on your door. And all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by Parliament. Residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence. The minister says they want to see 'fairness and balance' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit. These rules have now been changed during this parliament. Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued. They have also vowed to end the industrial use of CCTV'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking. We are bringing back common sense. Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute 'grace periods' for council-controlled parking, whether it's on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won't get fined for being a few minutes late. We're also ending the industrial use of CCTV'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking. The new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post, but ensure public safety as CCTV will still be used to protect schools, bus lanes and red routes. Why have we done this? Because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system. As a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs. And in another victory for common sense parking at an out-of-order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay. There are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they've done nothing wrong. We'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you, you'll receive a 25% discount even if the appeal is lost. These changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too. People supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce. Under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring. We're ending this pointless war on motorists so that you don't feel like a criminal just for parking your car."}

The U-turn comes hours after Obama political strategy director David Simas added fuel to U.S.-Israeli tensions by stopping short of congratulating Netanyahu \u2013 and instead only patting Israelis on the back for voting. 'We want to congratulate the Israeli people for the democratic process \u2013 for the election that they just engaged in, with all the parties that engaged in that election,' Simas had said. Aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama plans to call Netanyahu 'in the coming days.' COLD SHOULDER: The Obama administration initially offered congratulations only to the Israeli people \u2013 for holding an election \u2013 and the president won't call Netanyahu for days. The two leaders are pictured during an October 2014 meeting in the Oval Office. White House Director of Political Strategy David Simas said Wednesday morning that the White House wouldn't 'weigh in one way or another' on Netanyahu's crushing electoral win. CRUSHED IT: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election. DESIGNATED GROVELER? Secretary of State John Kerry was tapped to call Netanyahu on behalf of the White House \u2013 and made the call in the midst of nuclear negotiations with Israeli enemy Iran. The president's past practice, Earnest said, has been to wait until Israel's president formally asks Netanyahu to form a coalition government. That, judging from history, could take about a week. John Kerry phoned him, Earnest said, on behalf of the State Department \u2013 while he was in Switzerland negotiating with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. The White House's chief spokesman also said the administration is 'deeply concerned' about anti-Arab rhetoric that the Netanyahu campaign leveraged in its larger-than-expected win \u2013 and will make sure Bibi hears about it. The rhetoric'sought to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens,' Earnest said, according to a White House pool report filed from Cleveland, Ohio. 'The United States and this administration is deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens,' he added. 'It undermines the values and Democratic ideals that have been important to our democracy and an important part of what binds the United States and Israel together. 'Rhetoric that seeks to marginalize one segment of their population is deeply concerning and it is divisive and I can tell you that these are views the administration intends to communicate directly to the Israelis.' BY THE NUMBERS: Netanyahu's Likud party won 30 seats in the Israeli Knesset, enough to put together a ruling coalition of at least 61 seats by working with other right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties like Yisrael Betenu and Shas. JUBILANT: Supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his election campaign headquarters. Obama drew fire two weeks ago for refusing to meet with Netanyahu when he visited Washington for an historic speech to a joint meeting of Congress that was arranged behind his back. And conservatives howled when his former top campaign organizer, Jeremy Bird, turned up in Tel Aviv as the leader of a group working to oust Netanyahu \u2013 aided by a $350,000 State Department grant paid out last year. Netanyahu was quick to condemn what he called funding 'from abroad' of the group, called V15, whose stated goal was to remove him from power. But when the dust settled, Bibi's Likud party had won 30 seats in Israel's Knesset, while its chief rival the Zionist Union collected just 24. That result is strong enough for Netanyahu to build a governing coalition with other right-wing and center-right parties \u2013 and remain as prime minister. The White House has barely kept its dislike for Netanyahu concealed in recent months. The Israeli leader is among the world's harshest critics of the administration's efforts to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran, and it's thought that Obama would have preferred to deal with Zionist Union head Isaac Herzog. 'We're not going to weigh in one way or another,' Simas told CNN after 99 per cent of the votes were counted, 'except to say that the United States and Israel have a historic and close relationship and that will continue going forward.' TROUBLE: Jeremy Bird, the one-time director of Obama's electoral organizing campaign, worked to oust Netanyahu thruogh a group that got $350,000 in State Department funds in 2014. BIBI ON TOP: The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years. Pictured are Netanyahu supporters cheering as the results come in.

During Stoke\u2019s victory at Aston Villa last month, his reaction to referee Roger East\u2019s attack of cramp was more comic than concerned. It was similar when an irate Newcastle fan chucked the makeshift missile as celebrations followed Peter Crouch\u2019s equaliser. \u2018A referee with cramp! Can you believe it?\u2019 chuckles Walters. \u2018He needed to come off, didn\u2019t he? The programme was a good read. 10 out of 10. You\u2019ve got to enjoy yourself. When need be, I\u2019ll get stuck in but I play with a smile. Jon Walters spoke about many subjects, including his desire to play in Euro 2016, in a revealing interview. The Stoke City star takes his football seriously but also has a a fun side as his on-field antics show. The 31-year-old striker/winger claims he has mellowed since being involved in a ruck with Roy Keane. \u2018It\u2019s the best job in the world, if you don\u2019t enjoy it there\u2019s something wrong.\u2019 That encapsulates Walters, one of the Premier League\u2019s unlikely lads; tough yet funny, revelling in his fifth year as a Premier League player. He is delivering one-liners on the radio that amuse and slightly frighten, suggesting in the wake of the Jonny Evans-Papisse Cisse flare-up that any player who spat in his face will be \u2018eating his supper through a straw\u2019. He is laughing about his appearance in Roy Keane\u2019s book during their final fraught days together at Ipswich \u2014 \u2018a bust-up\u2026 effing and blinding\u2019 \u2014 having buried the hatchet at Republic of Ireland camps. \u2018I knew what was going to be written\u2026 it could have been worse,' he says. And he is pleased by having had such a good season after an inauspicious start. Walters became the first Stoke player to score a Premier League hat-trick with his right-foot, left-foot, header combination against Queens Park Rangers in January and was shortlisted for Ireland\u2019s player of the year award. All this after losing his place at Stoke side last summer. His appearance in Ireland\u2019s dramatic 1-1 draw in Germany in October meant he had completed more minutes for country than club: 180 to 139. \u2018We were losing games and I wasn\u2019t getting on, that made me worry more than anything,\u2019 admits Walters, 31. \u2018I was going away with Ireland asking a few of the lads how many games they\u2019d played. The Championship lads were saying, \u201c15, 20...\u201d. I\u2019d played two. Jesus! \u2018Martin O\u2019Neill and Roy Keane showed a lot of faith to play me. Then I came on (for Stoke) against Swansea when we were chasing the game and I scored. Since then I\u2019ve stayed in the team.\u2019 Walters flicks through a matchday programme thrown at him after Peter Crouch scored against Newcastle. The Potters joker found the funny side when referee Roger East was forced to withdraw with cramp. Walters carries the match ball after becoming the first Stoke player to score a Premier League hat-trick. Listening to soothing sounds has helped. \u2018Before kick-off, I\u2019ll have my earphones on and be tuning into some classical music,\u2019 Walters says. He lists Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D Major and material by pianist Ludovico Einaudi as favourites. He should be listening to some strings before playing against Poland in a game Ireland need to win to further their Euro 2016 ambitions. His participation was in doubt after he suffered a fractured cheekbone a fortnight ago but surgery and a protective mask make him available. \u2018It\u2019s a massive game,\u2019 he says. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult group but it\u2019s in our hands. There will be ups and downs. Germany was a high, scoring in the last minute. The Scotland defeat was a low. Qualifying is the main thing, it doesn\u2019t matter how.\u2019 Walters\u2019s career has been in the ascendancy since he left then League Two side Chester in 2007. He is Stoke\u2019s top scorer in a season that could still lead to a record-breaking points total and Premier League finish. Impressive when you consider the reshaping done by manager Mark Hughes since succeeding Tony Pulis when Walters\u2019s profile seemed not to quite fit. Whether operating up front or, more frequently, on the wing Walters has crafted his game to suit the passing style now employed under Hughes. \u2018In"}

Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid. Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year. The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition. Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.' He said the decision had been made by the British charity's'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work. Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy. 'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. 'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone \u2013 that's the work we do. 'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.' Justin Forsyth (left), the charity's chief executive pictured in Lebanon with Samantha Cameron, said he was'very sorry' for those upset by the decision to honour Tony Blair. Mr Blair was handed the award for spending billions of public money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year - also attended by\u00a0Mike Bezos (centre left), Dakota Fanning (centre right), and Nicholas Kristo (right) Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations'make mistakes'. Mr Forsyth was recruited to Number 10 by Mr Blair to help with work on poverty and climate change. He then became one of Gordon Brown's senior advisers before joining Save the Children. As prime minister, Mr Blair set up the Department for International Development and hosted a series of aid summits. Critics say Britain's foreign aid budget \u2013 which hit \u00a311.4billion last year \u2013 has led to a string of perverse outcomes, including spending millions in countries such as India which can afford its own space programme. Accepting his award last year, Mr Blair said: 'From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. 'But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.' At the time, a spokesman for Save The Children said: 'The UK's achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [Mr Blair's] leadership.'"}

Four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks, according to witnesses. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed.

The next attack took place about an hour later outside Monday Market, the main one in the city, where people were lined up to go through security. Those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of Boko Haram attacks in the city and region. Two women joined the female security line, one of whom \"blew herself up, causing minimal casualty,\" said witness Abdulkarim Musa. Then, as people gathered to help, the second woman detonated her explosives, said Musa, who was waiting outside the market in the male security line. The third attack occurred at a bus station. \"He came in our midst near the bus station and pressed a remote device he was holding in his hand,\" a wounded survivor who requested anonymity for his personal safety said from Maiduguri General Hospital. Such attacks, sadly, are nothing new for Borno State, one of those hit hardest by Boko Haram and the Nigerian military's campaign to stop them. The terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques, raided villages, and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok."}

Chris Mannion, 52, found old military papers which show his grandfather Lieutenant Sergeant Patrick Mannion caught Adolf Hitler's right-hand man. The evil Nazi was then the world's most wanted man and is known to have been found by a unit of four British and two Russian soldiers as he tried to flee Germany in 1945. An amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top Nazi Heinrich Himmler (right) - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather, Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion (left) Himmler, who was one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and was head of the SS, was wearing an eye patch disguise and carrying a bag of money when he was captured. He was taken to a checkpoint, quizzed and moved to a camp where he was identified  - before killing himself. The names of his arresting officers has always been known but the four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment - had been shrouded in mystery. Mr Mannion, from Manchester, says he discovered who the men were when researching his grandfather's military career. He spent \u00a330 accessing military service records of his grandfather - who he knew had served with 196 Battery. But he was stunned to find the records show Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion was one of the men who found Himmler. Historian Chris Mannion discovered documents (pictured) revealing his grandfather captured Himmler when researching his military career. An arrest report he was sent shows Himmler was picked up by one non-commissioned officer and three gunners. Mr Mannion says the documents show they were Gunner John Fletcher, Gunner Michael Faye, Gunner N Carlston and his own grandfather. The official records show one of the men fired a shot before Faye grabbed Himmler - and the group led him to the checkpoint. Mr Mannion now plans to publish the records and his findings in an upcoming book about Himmler's capture - and the men who found him. He said: 'As a young boy I looked up to him for being a soldier, and would play with his medals and bits and pieces he brought back from the war. 'I never knew what he had done in the war, I was always curious, but no one could tell me for certain. 'In the end I set out to find out myself. There was a rumour in the family about a high-ranking Nazi official but I didn't think in a million years I would find out anything like this. 'I decided to get his service records, paid \u00a330, and was sent 2,600 pages. They had the records of the capture of Himmler - and there was my grandfather's name.' When Himmler received the news of Hitler's death, he travelled to Flensburg where he remained for the first week of May. On May 15, 1945 he dismissed his staff and left with his two companions for a hide-out in the Harz Mountains. The three men set out on foot, moving across country, seeking cover in the woods, and sleeping in sheds or haystacks. The four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment (pictured, with Lt Sgt Mannion third from right, front row) - has been shrouded in mystery. Himmler's group were stopped on several occasions but managed to bluff their way through, until they tried to cross through Meinstedt on May 21. When they were about to travel through Meinstedt they were surprised by a British patrol of the four men from 196 Battery. They tried to evade capture but, after warning shots were fired, they stopped to be searched, taken to a military checkpoint and detained. Over the following two days, Himmler was moved to several camps and then the headquarters of the Second British Army in L\u00fcneburg, south of Hamburg, where he admitted who he was. A doctor tried to examine him but Himmler bit into a cyanide pill he had concealed, collapsing and dying shortly afterwards. Mr Mannion's documents showed that his grandfather fought in Normandy, Belgium, Holland and Germany. He landed in Normandy the day after D-Day, and was also involved in peacekeeping after the war, routinely patrolling Germany arresting fleeing Germans and preventing further unrest. According to the files, it was on one such patrol that Lt Sgt Mannion and three other members of his patrol stumbled across the group of Germans, who were acting suspiciously. Himmler (left) - one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and head of the SS - was Adolf Hitler's right-hand man. The report reads: 'On 21 May 45, at about 1930 hrs, one of the patrols which the Regt sent out daily to neighbouring villages, saw three men emerging from a wood, at Meinstedt. '"}

Speaking out for the first time since the tragedy, Zoey Mendoza, 41, has shared her heart-wrenching account of her final moments with five-year-old Jada and three-year-old Jordan, who were killed by her husband Kurtis Birth in Ringwood, New Jersey in October 2010. She also revealed that three weeks after their deaths, she read a book, Lessons from the Light by George Anderson, about how children continue to be with their families after they die. 'All of a sudden I heard my children giggling,' she told Yahoo Parenting. 'I sat straight up in bed and my room was bright white. It was like the sun was blazing though the windows, but it was nighttime. Missed: Zoey Mendoza has spoken out about the pain of losing her two children, five-year-old Jada, left, and three-year-old Jordan, right, who were killed by their father in New Jersey in October 2010. 'There was a white staircase next to my bed and my kids were standing at the top, smiling. The second our eyes met, they ran to me. They held me and laughed. They let me know that they love me and will always be with me.' Mendoza said her son and daughter continue to come to her in visions, which gives her comfort as she continues to struggle with the pain of losing them. Troubled: Kurtis Birth, 38, killed his children and himself as the couple went through a separation. Recounting the weeks leading up to the murders, she said she had told her husband of 12 years that she wanted a separation but that it was something he didn't want. As he struggled to cope with the impending split, he attempted suicide and was put in a psychiatric hospital and they agreed they would attend therapy sessions together, she recalled. He promised to take medication for depression - although she later found out he had not - and they continued to care for the children together under one roof, she said. 'As a mother, my job was to protect my children, and one of my most defining struggles is that I never thought they were in danger with their father,' she said. 'I never knew I had to protect my babies from Kurtis.' On October 18, 2010, she took the children to their daycare center in Wayne for the final time. 'I gave [Jada] a big bear hug and Jordan jumped on my back,' she recalled. 'We were all tangled up together - warm and in love - for the last time.' Later that day,  Mendoza received a desperate call from her husband. 'I love you and I want to make this work,' he told her. 'Why don't you love me anymore? I don't understand why we can't fix this \u2013 please.' She told him they would speak about it later - but after an hour, he texted her to tell her he was going to pick up the children, which was not what they had previously decided. Tragedy: She recalled the hugs she shared with her kids before she said goodbye for them for the last time. Scene: The children were found dead inside an abandoned home belonging to their father's parents, while he was found dead inside his car. They were killed after he picked them up early from daycare. Fears: After finding out police had gathered outside the home hours an hour after she had reported her children missing, Mendoza rushed there and screamed that her husband had killed her babies. She raced over to their daycare center but learned they had already been collected. Mendoza urged police officers to look for her husband and children at his parents' Ringwood home, which was abandoned but still filled with odd furniture and belongings. 'This is where Kurtis found his grandfather's 20-year-old rifle that he used to kill our children,' she told Yahoo. At 7.30pm that evening, a friend called her to say the home was surrounded by police. 'I was frantic,' she remembered. 'On the 20-minute ride all I said was: He killed my kids. He killed my kids. He killed my kids.' Birth had shot Jada and Jordan in the back of their heads with a.22-caliber rifle before taking his own life in his parked car. When Mendoza arrived on the scene, she screamed: 'Those are my children!' After the tragedy, friends told news stations that they were baffled as to what had driven Birth, a account executive for Cablevision and a doting father, to take the lives of his children. New love: Mendoza, who now lives in a New York town, has remarried and has three stepchildren. There were no warning signs, they said.

The police match commander in charge of Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 fans at the Hillsborough disaster. During the inquest into the deaths today, David Duckenfield also admitted that he 'froze' on the day in question, while Paul Greaney QC suggested that a child of 'average intelligence' could have realised the consequences of opening a gate to relieve congestion. Up to 2,000 fans entered Hillsborough stadium's Gate C, with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. They then continued to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing. Mr Greaney reminded Mr Duckenfield of his earlier evidence to Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, about his state of mind after the opening of Gate C when he told her: 'It was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step. My mind for a moment went blank.' Asked again if he 'froze', Mr Duckenfield said: 'It appears to be a distinct possibility.' Mr Greaney said: 'You know what was in your mind and I will ask just one last time. Will you accept that in fact you froze?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney went on: 'Do you agree with the following, that people died in a crush in the central pens?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred?' The witness repeated: 'Yes sir.' Liverpool supporters were crushed to death during an FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989. Liverpool supporters and family members of the victims of the disaster have long sought justice. The barrister continued: 'That closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said again: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That you failed to recognise that there was a need to close that tunnel.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I did fail to recognise that sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'And therefore failed to take steps to achieve that.' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did sir.' A young Liverpool fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the Hillsborough pitch. Mr Greaney said: 'That failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Earlier Mr Duckenfield had claimed he was unaware of the geography of Sheffield Wednesday's ground, this being his first match in charge, and denied that he 'bottled it'. Mr Greaney, representing the Police Federation, put it the retired police chief: 'Do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be?' Thousands of Liverpool fans hold up scarves during a Hillsborough memorial service at Anfield last year. Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did not think of it on the day, sir, because of the pressure I was under.' Mr Greaney asked: 'Is the explanation of your failures Mr Duckenfield not that you were ignorant of the geography for example but rather that you knew the geography, you knew what the consequences might be of people entering the crowd but you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'I am not in a position to make that judgment, sir. Others should make that judgment.' Mr Greaney continued: 'You bottled it. You panicked and you failed to take the action that you knew needed to be taken to avoid consequences that you had foreseen. Now does that describe your state at the time?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I disagree with you sir.' A shirt of local rivals Everton is among thousands of flower tributes laid at Anfield shortly after the disaster. 'Why?' asked Mr Greaney. Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because that's my view.' The barrister said: 'Why is it your view?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because it is my view and there can be no other view than mine.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you accept that might thought to be a rather arrogant thing to say?' The witness replied: 'Sir I apologise. If that appears arrogant I didn't mean that to be so.' The inquests have heard that Mr Duckenfield told the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were 'grave'.

Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo's front page leads on Gerard Pique, and his comparison to Bayern Munich and Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer. Pique has made the centre-back position his own and is now Barcelona's leader at the heart of defence. Beckenbauer is widely regarded as one of the best defenders ever to have lived, and the Spanish paper have dubbed Pique 'Piquembauer' on their front page. 'The comeback', reads the headline, as Mundo claim Pique has taken on the challenge and is once again a world-class performer in his position.

In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport carry an interview with Marcello Lippi, two-time Juventus manager and World Cup-winning coach with Italy. He claims he can see himself in Massimiliano Allegri, the current Juve manager, and has backed him to win the Champions League this season. Lippi was in charge of the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006 despite being underdogs in Germany, and thinks Juve's situation in Europe is similar. 'In the Champions League he can do like Italy in 2006,' Lippi told La Gazzetta. 'We weren't favourites, but we won. Lippi can see himself in Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri (pictured) and has backed him to succeed. 'Max arrived at Juve at the same age I did, he has my pragmatism.' Tuttosport's front page leads on UEFA president Michel Platini, who also has some kind words for his former club Juve. Aside from the Champions League, they are top of Serie A by 14 points and in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia. Allegri's side fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Fiorentina in the first leg of their semi-final, but Platini has backed them to make a comeback in the second leg on April 7.

England fell six points short of winning the Six Nations title despite a 55-35 win over France. \u2018There has always been a huge sense of belief that we are going in the right direction,\u2019 he said. \u2018The challenges we faced with the injury situation leading into the Wales game didn\u2019t dent that belief. From what I see in training we have a tight, connected group who are improving all the time. \u2018Clearly we are still a bit young, light on experience, particularly in the back line. \u2018That will improve with the likes of Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell and Manu being available, all of whom will be playing in the next few weeks we hope.\u2019 England have beaten World Cup pool rivals Australia and Wales convincingly and with 82,000 fans producing another pulsating atmosphere at Twickenham on Saturday, Lancaster says belief will be sky-high when the tournament kicks off on September 18.

England's Jonathan Joseph is challenged by France's Remi Tales during the match at Twickenham. \u2018Yes, definitely,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ve beaten Australia, we\u2019ve beaten Wales, we\u2019ve put 55 points on France. \u2018New Zealand we\u2019ve beaten before and pushed them close in the summer series. So, absolutely. \u2018You saw the influence the crowd had on the players today. Playing at home is a huge factor as well.\u2019 Lancaster now has four runners-up finishes in four Six Nations campaigns but has no fear his players will be psychologically damaged by another near miss. \u2018The players\u2019 mindset is to use it more as a motivation to make sure you don\u2019t feel that pain again.

Final resting place: The completed stone tomb (pictured) of Richard III is to go on public display after being lowered in to position. A special'service or reveal' marking the end of the king's journey to the cathedral will take place today. The 2.3-ton tombstone, which features a Christian cross carved on the top, was lifted  into place overnight at Leicester Cathedral. The setting of the great slab of Yorkshire Swaledale stone marks the end of a week in which the king was reinterred in a ceremony that included a poetry reading by actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The Queen called yesterday's service a moment of 'great national significance'. Organisers aimed to rebury the king with the 'dignity and honour' he was denied in death, after his original burial in a hastily-dug grave in the old Greyfriars church following his death at Bosworth field. The cathedral said it was expecting 'a considerable number of visitors from all over the world' to come and see the king's completed memorial.

Today's'service or reveal' will include interpretative dance charting the rediscovery of Richard's grave, the science behind identifying his remains and his reburial. A banner with the king's coat of arms, provided by the Richard III Society, will also be hung over the tomb in the ambulatory during the service. Liz Hudson, the cathedral's communications director, said: 'King Richard III's tomb is now a permanent feature in Leicester Cathedral. Archaeologists discovered the king under a council car park not far from the cathedral in August 2012. 'However, there are still a considerable number of visitors from all over the world in Leicester who we expect will want to take a last opportunity to see it before returning home. 'We anticipate a great deal of interest and suggest that people who live locally may find it easier to plan a visit to see the tomb at a slightly later date.' Last Sunday, more than 35,000 lined the streets for a procession of the king's coffin from the University of Leicester, whose archaeologists discovered his grave, to Bosworth and finally on to Leicester. Throughout the week, thousands waited in line for hours to see Richard's coffin as it lay in repose in the cathedral, before yesterday's reinterment presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Downton Abbey creator and writer Julian Fellowes and historical novelist Philippa Gregory attended the service, alongside the Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. Archaeologists discovered the king under a council car park not far from the cathedral in August 2012, after a campaign to find him led by Philippa Langley. An extensive series of scientific tests established that the skeleton, found in a grave too short for his body, was that of the last Yorkist king. His final rest was delayed by months after distant relatives brought an unsuccessful legal challenge through the courts, arguing he should be reburied in York."}

{"abstract": "The article discusses the parallels between the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran and its deal with Syria to remove chemical weapons. It argues that both deals are fundamentally flawed, as they rely on the regimes to declare their stockpiles voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. The article also suggests that the Iranian regime cannot be trusted, as it has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to them.", "article": "(CNN)As the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran, let us not forget: This is the second time in two years that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East. In doing so, he has ignored the regimes' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad's chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad's chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration's deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally na\u00efve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration's approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA's long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for \"death to America,\" Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a na\u00efve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for"}

This could potentially be used to develop new sources of energy, or to help clear up toxic metal pollution. The findings also raise the prospect that life may still be clinging on deep underground on planets such as Mars.", "article": "Bacteria growing on particles of magnetic crystal may form natural rechargeable batteries, according to new research. Scientists at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany have found that colonies of two types of bacteria can grow on a mineral called magnetite. They found one species of bacteria could dump electrons onto the crystals while another harvested the electrons from them depending on the amount of sunlight they received. Scientists have found that colonies of two types of bacteria can grow on a mineral called magnetite. Magnetite is an iron (III) oxide mineral that forms smooth black crystals, like those shown above, in rock. One species of bacteria dumped electrons while another harvested  from them depending on levels of sunlight. The scientists said that in the wild this may allow the magnetite crystals to act like natural rechargeable batteries for the bacteria. The findings has raised hopes that these 'batteries' could be used to help develop new sources of energy, although the charge they currently hold is minute. Life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground, raising hopes bacteria might be able to survive deep beneath the surface of other planets. Researchers found the single-celled organisms living inside coal beds more than 8,000ft (2,440 metres) below the seabed off the coast of Japan. It is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean. At those depths the spherical microbes have to survive huge pressures that would crush most organisms while having no access to light or oxygen often needed for life. Instead, the bacteria scavenge the chemicals they need to survive by breaking down the hydrocarbon compounds in the coal around them. The findings have raised the prospect that life may still be clinging on deep underground on planets such as Mars, where there was once thought to be flowing water on the surface. Dr James Byrne, who led the work at the University of T\u00fcbingen, said bacteria could be genetically engineered to increase this activity. 'In our study we only looked at iron metabolising bacteria, but we speculate that it might be possible for other non-iron metabolising organisms to use magnetite as a battery as well - or if they can be made to use it, through genetic engineering,' he said. 'Could engineering the bacteria increase the energy production or is it limited by the magnetite itself? 'The magnetite itself will only hold a maximum number of electrons, which is one of the limiting factors. 'However, the bacteria access these electrons through specialized enzymes known as cyctochromes. 'In principle, if the bacteria could be engineered with more of these electron carriers, then it could increase the speed at which they use the magnetite as a battery. 'It is probably not something that could be used for an application in the immediate future though.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Science, incubated a species of purple bacteria called Rhodopseudomonas palustris, which is found in soil, and another bacterium called Geobacter sulfurreducens. This graph shows the percentage change in charge on the magnetite caused during daylight and nighttime conditions. Rhodopseudomonas palustris removed electrons from the magnetite, causing the charge to fall while Geobacter sulfurreducens added electrons to increase charge on the mineral during the night. These were grown on nano-sized crystals of magnetite - an iron oxide based mineral found in rock formations that was used to make lodestones. The research team then varied the light levels to simulate the effect of night and day. They found that during the 'day time' Rhodopseudomonas bacteria harvested electrons from the magnetite, reducing its electric charge. During the night, the Geobacter took over and dumped electrons back onto the magnetite crystals, recharging it. Geobacter adds electrons to the iron in the crystals while metabolising other organic material. The researchers grew the bacteria on nano-sized magnetic particles of magnetite (left), which can be seen gathering on the inside of the bottle beside the magnet on the right in a solution of purple bacteria. Dr Byrne said the findings suggest a way in which bacteria could survive in extreme environments deep under ground. He said: 'The geochemistry is interesting in itself, but there are also potentially useful implications which may derive form this work. 'The flow of electrons is critical to the existence of all life and the fact that magnetite can be considered to be redox active opens up the possibility of bacteria being able to exist or survive in environments where other redox active compounds are in short supply in comparison to magnetite.' The researchers also believe the findings could also be used to help clear up toxic metal pollution, using bacteria coated magnetite to convert the metal into safer forms. There are a number of species of bacteria that have been found to eat electrons by harvesting them from metallic particles and others that spit them out. This diagram shows the conditions that the scientists believe leads to the bacteria (marked in pink) adding or removing electrons to the magnetite (the black circle) according to water levels and sunlight available.

She is the latest woman to flee the UK to join the barbaric terrorist group as a jihadi bride and support its frontline fighters.", "article": "The jihadi twin caught trying to enter Syria had already had a seven-month stay there with her toddler son, it emerged yesterday. Jamila Henry, 21, lived with two-year-old Mustafa in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa until just before Christmas. She came back to Britain to leave him with family before trying to return to Syria. On Monday Turkish police picked her up in the capital Ankara. Henry managed to flee the UK for a second time despite being on the radar of MI5, whose agents tried to recruit her. Wedding day: Jamila Henry with her estranged husband, whose identity is being protected. They interviewed her, gave her a smartphone and repeatedly contacted her. But, under their noses, she was able to steal her glamorous identical twin\u2019s passport and head back to the conflict zone. The astonishing lapse comes weeks after it emerged that Mohammed Emwazi \u2013 the Islamic State butcher called Jihadi John \u2013 was known to the security services for five years and they had tried to recruit him too. Despite being classed as a priority target, Emwazi managed to travel to the Middle East and start his reign of terror in Syria. Michael Adebolajo, one of the killers of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, was also courted by MI5. Last night, a friend of the Henry family lashed out at \u2018bumbling\u2019 MI5 officers, accusing them of trying to cover up their mistakes. \u2018They are a joke,\u2019 said the source. \u2018They keep calling everyone to find out what happened and telling them what they should and shouldn\u2019t say to people. Travel: Ms Henry tried to use a passport, left, which belonged to her 'party girl' twin sister Jalila, right. \u2018They were all over the family for months after Jamila came back but were left whistling in the wind when she disappeared again.\u2019 Under surveillance: Jamila Henry was questioned by MI5 before she fled to try and travel to Syria. Henry returned in December under pressure from relatives including her estranged husband. A source close to the family said: \u2018Her husband had no idea she was going to take Mustafa to Syria. He was extremely glad when they both returned safely. \u2018He and his parents were distraught and traumatised in the months the baby was missing. \u2018He in particular struggled not knowing where his son was or whether or not he was safe. It was a testing time. \u2018He suffered many sleepless nights fearing he would never see his child again. He had no contact with Jamila. All he could do was send messages via her family pleading for her to return his son and just prayed that his pleas would reach her.\u2019 Henry was stopped and questioned for up to nine hours by MI5 officers and detectives from Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command when she returned home with Mustafa in December. They released her without her being arrested or charged in the belief that she would co-operate with them as they investigated her movements and contacts in Syria. Henry converted to Islam in her teens and moved to east London where she had an arranged marriage with her husband, a Muslim Turkish Cypriot. The couple soon had their child but their relationship collapsed when Henry began spouting radical beliefs. Her latest journey to Turkey was on the passport of her \u2018south London party girl\u2019 twin sister Jalila. Yesterday Henry remained under arrest at a high-security central London police station after being flown back from Turkey to Luton airport on Thursday. She is being held on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. She is the latest woman to flee the UK to join the barbaric terrorist group as a jihadi bride and support its frontline fighters. Last month three \u2018straight A\u2019 east London schoolgirls, aged 15 and 16, abandoned their families to travel to Syria via Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a friend who joined Islamic State in December. All four went to the same Bethnal Green school.

The scars from where he shot himself are visible. A man charged with murdering his wife during a double suicide pact that went wrong has been dramatically acquitted by a jury. Lloyd Erp has spent more than two years in jail waiting to come to trial over the death of his wife Lori. The court heard how the couple, from Portland, Oregon, had both signed a suicide note saying they wanted to to die on March 2, 2013. Mr Erp told the court that his 52-year-old wife shot herself twice in the head in their bedroom, before he took the rifle and tried to kill himself. He shot himself twice in the head, but survived. Police were called and Lori was found in bed. Mr Erp was arrested and charged with murder, and during the trial prosecutors claimed a post-mortem examination of Lori's body suggested she had been shot by someone else. But on Wednesday Mulnomah County jurors cleared him of murder, after deliberating for less than a day. During the trial, a defence lawyer told jurors the Erps were deeply in love but suffered health problems and addictions to painkillers. They also faced losing their home because neither of them were in work. Mr Erp told the court he still missed his wife terribly, and some days still wants to die, according to a report by\u00a0OregonLive. An earlier trial saw the jury reach deadlock - because they could not decide whether Mr Erp had shot and murdered his wife - and a mistrial was declared. But during the latest court appearance, prosecution lawyer Tom Cleary urged jurors to follow Oregon law, which said that if they believed Mr Erp fired the fatal shots they must find him guilty of murder. 'This is not a Death With Dignity case,' the prosecutor said. The judge also instructed jurors that Oregon law doesn't define murder as assisting another in committing suicide, such as handing someone a loaded gun. But state law does define murder as committing the actual killing, the judge said -- actually pulling the trigger even if the person wanted to die. Dr Christopher Young, deputy state medical examiner, testified that he determined Lori Erp didn't shoot herself but died by someone else's action. Mr Erp's 52-year-old wife Lori (pictured) was found dead at her home in bed with two shots to her head. Prosecutors alleged Mr Erp had tried to kill her, but he successfully argued that she had shot herself. However defence expert and former medical examiner Dr Michael Propst, said it was unclear whether the woman died by her own hand. Lawyer for the defence Kasla Rutledge added: 'People who are murdered in their sleep by their husbands don't leave suicide notes.' The report in OregonLive added that Mr Erp had not been allowed to attend his wife's memorial service. 'This has been two long years that Lloyd has been in custody, waiting to be exonerated,' Ms Rutledge said. 'He has not been able to grieve. He has not been able to process what happened and his survivor's guilt. And now he gets a chance to do that.'"}

The women are attempting to be the first female 4's team to row unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from America to Australia, which will involve spending two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months. Apart from issues like sleep deprivation, adverse weather conditions, injury, salt sores, sun exposure and potential equipment malfunction, the\u00a0coxless crew also need to train themselves to deal with psychological challenges of  monotony, confined living quarters and limited contact with the outside world. That's on top of the fitness and strength training needed to take on the momentous rowing feat. Yet, the formidable foursome set to  embark on this exceptional journey - in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris - describe themselves as 'ordinary'. Laura Penhaul, 31, from Cornwall, is a physiotherapist for the Paralympics and is the team leader; Natalia Cohen, 40, from Manchester is a travel operations manager and has spent two decades living in countries in the developing world; Isabel Burnham, 30, from Cambridge works as a solicitor and Emma Mitchell, 29, from Marlow is an expedition manager for a travel company. The\u00a0coxless crew, who\u00a0are aiming to raise over a quarter of a million pounds for two charities: Walking With the Wounded and Breast Cancer Care survivors, have just over two weeks to go before they embark upon their voyage. Taking on the challenge of a lifetime: Isabel Burnham,  Laura Penhaul, Emma Mitchell and Natalia Cohen will row the Pacific in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called Doris. Laura said: 'We say that this row is 85 per cent psychological in how we cope and 15 per cent physical, but our psychological state will be affected by being dehydrated, calorie deficient, sleep deprived and hormone imbalanced. So if we can optimise these variables then it will will help our mental state.' Natalia added: 'Our mental strength is going to be vital. I believe that we all have our own Pacific to cross, in whatever form that comes. 'We want to empower others to have faith  and dig deep to fight and overcome whatever adversity life throws your way. I believe you can do anything you set your mind to.' So how are the brave four ensuring they are in peak mental and physical health?

Disney World is a real life Magic Kingdom for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking, cavernous Citrus Bowl on Sunday afternoon. A sell-out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness Orlando City, led out by Brazilian legend Kaka, in their inaugural MLS match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of NYCFC. David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City. Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City. The match will take place at Florida's Citrus Bowl, which was a venue at the 1994 USA World Cup. It\u2019s an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating. Yet while the newfangled New York franchise have literally started from scratch, this match, shown live on Sky Sports in the UK, marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams. Adrian Heath, the former England Under 21 and Everton midfielder, has been in charge all of that time, thanks in no small part to a chance meeting in a Newcastle-under-Lyme pub with a bloke called Phil Rawlins. Rawlins, a director at Stoke City who founded a highly successful IT sales and marketing consulting company in Texas, has lived in the US for 17 years and was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes. Heath was keen too. Former Everton midfielder Adrian Heath has guided Orlando City to MLS after four years of hard work. Heath's appointment came after a chance meeting with Phil Rawlins (right), who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes. Out of work after not having a caretaker stint at Coventry City turn into a permanent role, the 54 year-old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the US during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of Portland. The possibilities fascinated him. Initially the pair, introduced to each other by agent Gary Mellor, went to Texas where Rawlins founded the Austin Aztecs. At this point, leaving the USL Pro, the third tier of the American soccer scene, and joining MLS was more than a pipedream. So Rawlins upped sticks and relocated everyone to Florida. And Orlando City were born. Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' A first championship was secured in their inaugural season and, impressively, a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of MLS side Miami Fusion in 2002 (Fusion were based in Fort Lauderdale, a good 200 miles away), the Orlando natives got straight behind the Lions. Another regular season title and a second championship followed. That has ensured that Heath has achieved a rare feat \u2013 taking a team up through the levels in a country where promotion and relegation are dirty words. Unlike New York City, there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city. Eight players remain the squad from their final USL Pro season. NYCFC manager Jason Kreis will lead his team out for their first ever MLS match on Sunday. NYCFC will begin in front of a 62,000 sell-out crowd against Orlando City at Citrus Bowl in Florida. Yet not everything came easily. Behind the scenes, Rawlins was working tirelessly. He desperately wanted to take the club on to the highest level. That, however, needs more than sweat and toil on the pitch. With top level franchise costs rocketing from $7.5 to $100 million, big bucks are needed to take a seat at the top table. They were snubbed by MLS in 2012. Enter Brazilian millionaire Flavio Augusto da Silva in February 2013. Having made his money in setting up English language schools back home, his arrival has been key. He provides the conduit between South America and the US, a partnership which satisfies many people on myriad levels. Naturally, his wealth and business expertise have ensured Orlando City\u2019s dream has become a striking reality. His links into the South American market, where so much talent bubbles under the surface, have been crucial \u2013 Columbia, El Salvador and Brazil are all represented in Heath\u2019s squad.

The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit.

But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return. Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food.

He scored two goals against Liverpool, showing his incredible technique and creativity, and has more goals and assists than any other midfielder since 2011. His defensive discipline may not be the best, but his attacking prowess is undeniable.", "article": "You don't  restrict an artist. He's there to create, to entertain, to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering  how the hell he did it. Louis van Gaal used Juan Mata as a 'false right winger' at Anfield six days ago, and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by David Moyes and Jose Mourinho. The  two-time Chelsea Player of the Year showed good things come to those who wait, as Liverpool's 3-4-3 formation that snookered teams from January\u00a0onward\u00a0was lost on Manchester United. Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata scores the second of his double to seal an important win at Anfield. Mata's perfect technique for his scissor-kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season. Liverpool could do little to stop Mata's incredible scissor-kick giving them a 2-0 lead at Anfield. Mata runs away in celebration with United team-mates Marouane Fellaini (right) and Wayne Rooney (left) It was, if nothing else, unexpected.\u00a0Mata had gone unused, having played just 15 minutes across four Premier League games in February, and it was reminiscent of his bit-part role at Chelsea. Mourinho considered Oscar a better fit as his No 10, believing Mata's defensive cover left a lot to be desired. He is not a tackler, nor is he the physical type. You don't buy a Jack Russell Terrier then expect it to behave like an American Pit Bull. Mata is a different breed. What he is, is an architect. Since the start of the 2011-12 Barclays Premier League season, he has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder. Close behind is Manchester City's David Silva (63) and Yaya Toure (61), then Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard (both 58). Yet his defensive discipline \u2013\u00a0or lack thereof \u2013 is what Mourinho considered his\u00a0Achilles heel. It's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles (0.64), clearances (0.16) and duels won (14.29 per cent) per game when he, Silva, Toure, Hazard and Gerrard are compared, but that's not his job. Mata left Chelsea for United in a \u00a337m switch but manager David Moyes never got his money's worth. Mata's prayers have been answered at United as he looks to get a regular run out by Louis van Gaal. Only Silva (365) beats him in chances created out of the entire Premier League since the beginning of 2011-12, but Mata (291) has played 466 fewer minutes. He's the creative kind, but would most likely still be warming the substitutes' bench at Stamford Bridge had he not swapped south for north. It was Moyes that bought Mata from Chelsea, phoning him personally to explain what he wanted.\u00a0Fluidity, assists and goals were the demands, and Mata agreed. Two days later, he arrived at Carrington \u2013 by helicopter, no less \u2013 and it was confirmed. Chelsea made a tidy \u00a313.5m from the Mata move. Shrewd as ever, as they were with David Luiz (\u00a331.6m profit), Andre Schurrle (\u00a34m), Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a311m), Romelu Lukaku (\u00a318m) and Thorgan Hazard (\u00a35.5m), among others. Moyes, however, never got his money's worth. Mata celebrates his goal with team-mate Daley Blind at Anfield on Sunday during their win. Mata\u00a0has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder in the Premier League since 2011. It was when he left Manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began. He hadn't kept Sir Alex Ferguson's backroom staff. He failed to replace Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra. His style of football was cautious, slow and predictable compared to his predecessor's attacking outlook. Another supposed error was wasting \u00a364m on Marouane Fellaini and Mata. Yet the new man at Manchester United is getting what Moyes couldn't out of both. Against Liverpool, Fellaini and Mata covered the most distance (11.6km each) out of everyone. Mata had more touches (93) than anyone else, made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy, and made Hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player (3). For a player without a shot on target in the Premier League since December 20, he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry. Alberto Moreno, lugging five yards behind for Mata's first and not tracking him for the second, was tormented by the man that goes by 'Johnny Kills' \u2013\u00a0a suitable nickname handed to him by former Chelsea team-mate Daniel Sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name.

{"abstract": "Harvard scientists have warned that the Chinchorro mummies, which have been preserved for thousands of years, are now in danger of rapid decomposition due to rising humidity. The mummies were prepared by removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, and covering the skin with a paste. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years, predating the ancient Egyptians by 2,000 years.", "article": "(CNN)As long as 7,000 years ago, the Chinchorro people who lived along the desert coast of what is now Chile and Peru were mummifying the bodies of those who died. But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame. As a result, scientists at the University of Tarapaca's archeological museum in Arica, northern Chile, have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of Chinchorro mummies start turning into a \"black ooze,\" it said. Egypt dig unearths 3,600-year-old mummy. The role of rising humidity was confirmed through testing on skin samples by Harvard professor Ralph Mitchell and researcher Alice DeAraujo, according to the news release. Their findings will help conservationists in Arica -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics. Egypt's mummies get CT scans. But Mitchell said he was concerned about potentially hundreds more mummies buried just below the sandy surface in the valleys of northern Chile. \"You have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: How do I stop them from decomposing? It's almost a forensic problem,\" he is quoted as saying. A \"complicated process\" was used to prepare the mummies, said Marcela Sepulveda, professor of archaeology at the University of Tarapaca, cited in the news release. It involved removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese, ocher or brown mud, depending on the period. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years. The oldest of the mummies date back some 2,000 years before the ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs.

The country's first ever female SWAT team, known as 'Snow Eagle', was unveiled on Wednesday in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, according to the People's Daily Online. The crack team of female soldiers has been trained by the Chinese border police before they were picked to form the specially-created division. Scroll down for video. Snow Eagle: China's first female SWAT team was formed this week, consisting of 34 members. 'To pull out the gun, I only need 0.3 seconds and then make the first shot in another 0.3 seconds,' said Liu Siqi, who is the team's top marksman and has served in the border police for four years. Miss Liu said the shooting skill is the result of continuous training for at least six hours every day all through the year. She has already fired over 10,000 shots during three years of training. Taking aim: The Team's top marksman can pull out a gun and shoot down the target in 0.6 seconds. Climbing higher: The members demonstrated a series of combat during the inauguration ceremony. 'When I had really good shooting scores, sometimes full scores, I would be so thrilled,' said another member, Mi Xue. 'I would take the target sheet back to my dorm and pin it on the wall. I would smile whenever I see it.' The 34 members all sport the same 'basin' haircut and wear bright-red berets, which has earned them the nickname 'Little Red Caps'. Intense training: Members have gone through\u00a0continuous training on shooting for at least six hours every day. Special force: The team is set to be tasked with responding to any emergency situations in times of possible future terror attacks. During their inauguration ceremony this week, the women demonstrated a series of combat and shooting skills. They also showed a softer side and performed music to the media with a zither and ukulele after training. According to Chinese media, the team will conduct further training camps and be tasked with responding to any emergency situations including terror attacks. 'Snow Eagle' is based in China's troubled far west region, Xinjiang, where ethnic conflicts between Uyghur and Han have caused unrest in the past. Zhang Chunxian, the Communist Party Secretary of the autonomous region, confirmed this week there have been individuals from Xinjiang travelling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, reported the People's Daily Online.

And as this incredible video shows, planes flying into Manchester battled against the winds that saw many appear to be 'hovering' on their descent in. Posted on Twitter by user@philip2004, the action was taken from near the airport pub close to the runway. Scroll down for video. As well as tilting from side to side, the plane appears to be 'hovering' as it gets trapped by the wind. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, @philip2004 from Stockport, said 'I'd say the wind was gusting at about 35 miles per hour. 'I never fear the aircraft landing but it did look nice and they will land ok. 'I really need to get filming where I can barely stand up myself.'The only thing is predicting when there's a long enough day of winds. 'The planes were swaying in the wind but it wasn't as big a deal as other days I've seen. I was here for the Emirates one last week when they had to abort the landing.' The wind was thought to only be around 35mph, but the direction and pressure affected the landing. Rob Hunter, British Airline Plot's Association (BALPA) head of flight safety told MailOnline Travel that pilots are well-trained to deal with a crosswind landing. 'The pilots here are performing a cross-wind landing which we train for all the time, and which are not that unusual,' said Mr Hunter. 'The wind is trying to push the aircraft one way, so the pilot has to point the aircraft into the wind until the last minute at which point he or she then turns the aircraft to be head on with the runway. 'This is just one example of the need for well-trained, well-rested professional pilots.' Mr Dodd told MailOnline that he was always confident the plane would make a safe landing. As well as capturing the windy landing for an Etihad 777, he also videoed British Airways and easyJet planes having a less-than comfortable descent. Last week he was on hand to catch a 'go around' of an Emirates A380 when it couldn't land due to high winds. The plane that had flown in from Dubai came around a second time, and despite a few wobbly moments, made a safe landing. After getting over a period of crosswinds, the Etihad jet approached the runway effortlessly. It was by no means the most comfortable of landings, but all passengers were safe on board. The manoeuvre meant the passengers were only delayed by 25 minutes; a scheduled landing of 11.20am turned into 11.45am. One eyewitness told the Manchester Evening News: 'This is a huge plane which we see come over every day and it's quite unusual to see it do a go-around like it did.' In January this year, planes were battered by 100mph winds when trying to land at Leeds Bradford International Airport. One propeller plane - a Flybe flight - looks particularly precarious as it swings from side to side on the approach. Pushed sideways onto the runway, the plane almost seems to land nose-first as it struggles against the gusts. Leeds Bradford Airport is considered one of the most difficult airports to land at in the UK. Its altitude sees it hit by strong winds in bad weather. But these skilled pilots show how flights compensate for the high winds, by approaching at an extreme angle. Footage emerged after a North Atlantic storm hit the UK, causing the strongest wind gusts in over 50 years."}

Attorney Jerryl Christmas told reporters on Monday that he met with Williams for two hours but police wouldn't allow him to take pictures. In a mugshot of Williams released on Sunday his face and neck appeared to have several cuts and bruises, although Christmas didn't make clear if those were the injuries he was referencing. Williams had appeared briefly in court on Monday morning. without counsel and did not enter a plea. He is charged with two. counts of first-degree assault, a class A felony that calls for. 10-30 years, or up to life in prison. The shooting was the latest violent incident in months of. demonstrations in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, after a white. police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown. during a confrontation in August. In announcing Williams's arrest on Sunday, St. Louis County. Prosecutor Robert McCulloch told reporters Williams had admitted. firing the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday and. told authorities he was not shooting at police. 'With regard to the allegations that Jeffrey Williams was. 'beaten' by police, the St. Louis County Police Department calls. these allegations completely false,' spokesman Brian Schellman. said in a statement. Schellman said Williams was taken immediately to St. Louis County Police headquarters after his arrest, interviewed by detectives on video and audio, booked and evaluated by a nurse as every inmate is, to determine if he is fit to be confined. Shooting: Police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the Ferguson Police Station last Thursday. Christmas said Williams was taken into custody on a. probation warrant and did not know he was being arrested until. he was taken for questioning. No one responded Monday at the Williams address listed in. court records, a one-story blue house that had trash strewn on. the lawn. Neighbors declined to comment. Police had called the shooting an 'ambush' of the officers,. who were standing side by side, by a gunman embedded with. protesters, but McCulloch said on Sunday that Williams may have. been shooting at someone else. Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize. or know Williams as a protester. 'Clearly this was not a police ambush and police were never. the target,' Christmas said, adding: 'It could have easily been. the protesters who got shot instead of the police.' The shooting of the officers followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the U.S. JusticeDepartment released a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing. Wounded: In the shooting early on Thursday, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound. Another officer, 32, suffered a facial wound. Above, one of the officers  is seen being taken away by EMT. In announcing Williams's arrest on Sunday, St. Louis CountyProsecutor Robert McCulloch told reporters Williams had admittedfiring the shots that wounded the officers early on Thursday andtold authorities he was not shooting at police. The Justice Department, which launched an investigation. after Brown's shooting, found pervasive racial bias in. Ferguson's policing and municipal court practices. Its police. force is mostly white while two-thirds of residents are black. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, its city manager and. its municipal court judge have resigned. Williams, who had been on probation for possession of stolen. property, is accused of firing shots from a car just as a rally. after Jackson's resignation was breaking up. Demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after Brown's. shooting in August and again in November when a grand jury. declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson. Police drew criticism for mass arrests and use of gas. canisters, rubber bullets and armored vehicles in the days after. Brown's shooting, a response officials said was needed to quell. the unrest.

Daniel Rios collected the ball on the edge of the area, traded passes with Diego Gama, before firing in a shot that goalkeeper Christian Walton blocked with his body. England\u2019s first sniff of goal fell to Arsenal\u2019s Chuba Akpom, having his best campaign yet on the fringes of Arsene Wenger\u2019s first team, but his daisy-cutter from range lacked power. One of those cross-field pings almost caught England out on 19 minutes when the impressive Luis Marquez found Ramirez wide on the left. Instead of looking for options centrally, he shot from a tight angle and Walton gathered. Nottingham Forest midfielder Ben Osborn pinged a shot a couple of feet wide of the post but Mexico enjoyed the best chance of the half just after the half-hour. An inswinging corner from Marquez was met by Gama, who had burst to the near post, but his header crashed back off the crossbar with Walton beaten. The game changed when Mexico goalkeeper Raul Gudino upended England's Chuba Akpom. The goalkeeper was shown a straight red card and Akpom converted the subsequent penalty.

The solitary change to the starting XV that toppled Scotland 25-13 last weekend sees Parling replace Dave Attwood, who has been dropped from the 23 altogether. Instead, head coach Stuart Lancaster has looked to Easter to provide lock cover among the replacements as England aim to clinch a first Championship since 2011. Lancaster named his squad before taking a training run at England's base in Bagshot, which was attended by renowned rugby fan Prince Harry. Geoff Parling, here training in Bagshot on Thursday, has been named in England's starting XV. England coach Stuart Lancaster and Prince Harry watch over training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday. Lancaster and the royal rugby fan share a laugh ahead of England's Six Nations finale against France. 'Geoff did well off the bench against Scotland and now that he has got some games under his belt we feel it is the right time to start him and use his experience and quality in the starting line-up,' Lancaster said. 'The same goes for Nick Easter, who has really impressed in camp and in his appearances off the bench. 'Nick is a quality ball carrier and great defender - things we feel we'll need in the latter stages of the game.' England were delighted by Parling's forceful 30-minute shift from the bench against Scotland, so the Test British and Irish Lion returns and he will replace lock partner Courtney Lawes in running the line-out.

The England team form a huddle during England training ahead of their final Six Nations match of 2015. Nick Easter comes back to the bench and will provide lock cover with Dave Attwood dropped altogether. Attwood has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with Lancaster believing the street-wise Easter is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware. Tom Youngs was strongly praised by Lancaster following his substitute display at Twickenham last Saturday, but Dylan Hartley has held off the challenge from his rival and continues at hooker. The backline remains unchanged and now has a settled look to it with inside centre providing the only real question mark. Luther Burrell continues at 12 knowing that had Brad Barritt not been stricken by a high ankle sprain, his place in the starting XV would have been in doubt and the Northampton midfielder needs to impress against France.

'It's a great achievement for Dan to win his 50th cap, especially coming back from his injury last year. He is one of the cornerstones of our squad and we all wish him all the best,' Lancaster said. Bookmakers view England as favourites to be crowned 2015 Six Nations champions on a nerve-shredding day of staggered kick-offs that conclude at Twickenham. Wales and Ireland are also in contention - they visit Rome and Edinburgh respectively - but it is the Red Rose who top the table courtesy of a points cushion of plus four.

For a third successive year the outcome is set to be decided by points difference and with their showdown against the typically unpredictable French closing the Championship, it is the 2015 World Cup hosts who will know exactly what target they must chase down. 'Finishing off the tournament at home is going to be a great occasion,' Lancaster said.

The report did not look at whether the reactivation of the faults was linked to fracking, although previous research has linked fracking to 3,600 small earthquakes in Oklahoma from 2009-2014. In 2011, Oklahoma suffered a 5.6 magnitude quake that damaged homes and businesses.", "article": "Fault lines dating back hundreds of millions of years in Oklahoma that have been recently reactivated could lead to a devastating quake in the state where many structures were not built to withstand major seismic activity, a report said. The state, which has seen several hundred seismic events over the past five years, has 'a high degree of potential earthquake hazards,' according to the study accepted for publication this month whose authors include researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 'The majority of the recent earthquakes in central Oklahoma define reactivated ancient faults at shallow depths in the crust' of less than 3.7 miles (6 km), said the report for the American Geophysical Union. Scroll down for video. History: The state of Oklahoma saw more earthquakes in 2014 than ever before in its recorded history. Building codes in Oklahoma for seismic events are not as stringent as in quake-prone states such as California (here, maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on Benedictine Hall at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee after two quakes hit the area in less than 24 hours in 2011) The report did not look at whether the reactivation of the faults was linked to the energy extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. However, USA Today, reported that previous research has identified hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as being behind 3,600 small earthquakes in Oklahoma from 2009 - 2014. Daniel McNamara, one of the paper's authors and a research geophysicist at USGS, said on Tuesday the 300 million-year-old subsurface faults that had not been active are suspected to be associated with the recent seismic activity. 'Any one of these fault zones that are producing magnitude 3 or 4 earthquakes could rupture into a larger earthquake. There are as many as 12 different fault zones that are capable of producing a large, 5 to 6 magnitude earthquake,' he said. In November 2011, Oklahoma suffered a 5.6 magnitude quake that damaged more than a dozen homes and several businesses. Building codes in Oklahoma for seismic events are not as stringent as in quake-prone states such as California. Wastewater disposal related to the fracking is suspected by many scientists to contribute to the earthquake activity. Millions of gallons of waste water are typically trucked from a fracking site to wells where the water is injected thousands of feet underground into porous rock layers. Energy companies deny there is a link between fracking and major seismic activity. The 300-million-year-old fault lines in Oklahoma are being reactivated by multiple earthquakes in the state that scientists previously have said were linked to fracking - although the most recent research did not look at the energy extraction technique. In November 2011, Oklahoma suffered a 5.6-magnitude quake that damaged more than a dozen homes and several businesses (here, a man examines bricks that fell from three sides of his in-law's home in Sparks after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours during the large 2011 quake)"}

Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, who was arrested on January 26, was formally charged with multiple counts, including malice murder, felony murder and armed robbery, in Telfair County, Georgia on Monday. Towns allegedly shot Marietta couple, Elrey 'Bud' Runion, 69, and his wife June, 66, after he responded to Mr Runion's Craigslist post seeking his dream car. The grandfather was looking for someone willing to sell their\u00a01966 Ford Mustang convertible; he had bought the same model after returning from the Vietnam War decades ago. Scroll down for video. Indicted: Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, pictured in court in January, has been indicted in the deaths of an elderly Georgia couple. They were killed after Towns allegedly told them he had a car they were interested in buying. After receiving a response from a potential seller, the couple set out for Telfair County to check out the car. They were last seen taking their evening trip on January 22. According to the indictment, Towns met the couple and, brandishing a weapon, stole their phones, Mr Runion's wallet, his wife's purse and  the couple's SUV, the Macon Telegraph\u00a0reported. Their SUV was found submerged in a pond near Towns' home  several days later, and the couple's bodies were found along a nearby dirt road. They had been shot in their heads. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson has previously said that robbery appears to be the motive for the killings. He said investigators found no evidence he had the sort of car the couple had been seeking. On Monday, Towns' attorney, Franklin J. Hogue, told the Macon Telegraph that his client, who worked in construction and has a wife and a two-year-old daughter, had not confessed to anything. Killed: Bud and June Runion, who had been married for 38 years, were found shot dead along a dirt road in Georgia in January, several days after they left their home to meet a potential car seller. Beloved: The couple, who ran their own charity, left behind three daughters and three grandchildren. Hogue called Towns, who has no prior criminal record,'very courteous and polite'. Towns will return to court on April 9 for a bond hearing and on June 25, he will appear at an arraignment, where he will plead guilty or not guilty to the charges. At that hearing, prosecutors will also reveal if they plan to seek the death penalty. The beloved couple, who had been married 38 years, left behind three daughters and three grandchildren, according to their obituaries. They ran a charity called Bud's Bicycles which had helped people in need from storm-damaged Alabama towns and impoverished pockets of West Virginia to their hometown in suburban Atlanta. 'He said, \"You can't take money with you when you're gone,\"' the couple's daughter, Brittany Patterson, told the Associated Press in January. 'You might as well spend and enjoy it.' Dream car: Mr Runion had posted an advert on Craigslist looking for a 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible - a car he had bought after returning from Vietnam decades earlier. Towns allegedly told them he had one. Found: The couple's SUV, pictured, was found submerged in a pond near Towns' home several days later. She recalled how, years ago, Runion drove past two young girls sorting through a Dumpster on Christmas Eve. He fixed up two bicycles belonging to his own girls and delivered them as gifts. It was the beginning of 'Bud's Bicycles,' a charity run loosely out of Mount Paran Church of God in Marietta. Runion met his wife, a teacher, at the church in the 1970s. Neighbors said the Runions built a shed in their backyard to house the bikes. Their donations eventually expanded to include food, household and school supplies, coats and blankets. 'Basically, he had a food pantry in the basement of their house,' Patterson said. She added that her father had served in Army's 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, though he never talked to her about the experience in detail. 'He's a survivor and fighter, and I know he wouldn't have gone out without fighting and trying to protect my mother,' she said. Charged: Towns, a married father, has not admitted to the murders and will enter a plea this summer."}

At a Florida prayer meeting last week, the 68-year-old used a very graphic and brutal story about murder, castration and child rape to explain the inherent problems with non-believers. In his lucrative second career as a Christian speaker, Robertson used the hypothetical situation to illustrate whether or those who don't believe in God can know right from wrong. Scroll Down to Listen. Controversial: Phil Robertson has developed a second career speaking at Christian events (seen here at one prior to his speech in Florida on Friday) The story begins with Robertson challenging his audience to make a bet with him: 'Two guys break into an atheist's home. He has a little atheist wife and two little atheist daughters. Two guys break into his home and tie him up in a chair and gag him.' With the unsettling scene set, Robertson carried on with his morality tale. 'Then they take his two daughters in front of him and rape both of them and then shoot them, and they take his wife and then decapitate her head off in front of him and then they can look at him and say, 'Isn't it great that I don't have to worry about being judged? Isn't it great that there's nothing wrong with this?'' Robertson said. 'There's no right or wrong, now, is it dude?'' To finish off his point and leave his audience in no doubt about his point, Robertson then took relish in describing a castration. 'Then you take a sharp knife and take his manhood and hold it in front of him and say, 'Wouldn't it be something if there was something wrong with this? But you're the one who says there is no God, there's no right, there's no wrong, so we're just having fun. We're sick in the head, have a nice day.' Outspoken: Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson (pictured here in Maryland in February) made another controversial speech in Florida on Friday. To finish off his modern-day parable, Robertson then said, 'If it happened to them, they probably would say, 'Something about this just ain't right.' This of course is just the latest in a long ling of controversial comments the Duck Dynasty star has made. In 2013 during a GQ interview he likened homosexuality to bestiality and adultery and also said that black people were happier before the civil rights movement. In response to the speech, the Friendly Atheist blog said that Robertson probably doesn't know any atheists and therefore is unqualified to make his damning assessment. 'I don't know a single atheist or agnostic who thinks that terrorizing, raping, torturing, mutilating, and killing people is remotely OK, and I frankly think that Robertson doesn't either,' wrote the blog."}

'The only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose.' Clarkson's future at the BBC is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in North Yorkshire. He now faces an interrogation over his row with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon by BBC chiefs, who are said to be 'desperate' to get rid of him. Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days. Mr McCarthy went on to add that Top Gear with a 'neutered' Clarkson would not work either in the Radio Times interview. He said: 'The charm and brilliance of Jeremy are that he is a slightly loose cannon, you're not quite sure what he's going to do next. 'There is an unpredictability \u00a0coupled with creative genius. 'I think he is God's gift to British broadcasting, and a brilliant journalist.' He went on to clarify that he wasn't 'puffing him up', and that the pair weren't close, he was just very aware of his talents. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) The BBC owns both the Top Gear name and the format of the show, meaning that it could still air without Mr Clarkson. However, many viewers tune in specifically because of the controversial presenter, and would be unwilling to watch it without him. Top Gear averages around 5.5million viewers an episode, but a programme about the Red Arrows airing in the same slot on Sunday night only attracted 1.3million viewers. More than 935,000 people have signed an online petition to reinstate him on Top Gear, whilst Prime Minister David Cameron, a close friend of the television presenter, has said that his children would be \u2018heartbroken\u2019 if the show is taken off air on a permanent basis. The series also raises around \u00a350million a year for the Corporation, thanks to its sales overseas. The version featuring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May is aired in some 214 territories around the world \u2013 a record for any British programme. It has also been remade for certain markets, including America and France. Some BBC insiders argue that another host could take Mr Clarkson\u2019s place. BBC Radio 2 host Chris Evans has been tipped for the role, although he has ruled himself out of the running. The news comes as the BBC backed Clarkson's use of the word 'pikey'. The word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a 'running gag' between Clarkson and fellow presenter James May about their colleague Richard Hammond's perceived cheap style. A complaint was lodged by the Traveller Movement charity after it appeared on a placard in a Top Gear episode from February last year. And last night Clarkson was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the March edition of Top Gear magazine that foreign taxi drivers in London have'vehicles smelling of sick'. He also turned on drivers in the North, saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants 'who have never experienced tarmac before'. Mr McCarthy went on to add that Top Gear with a 'neutered' Clarkson would not work either. He said: 'The charm and brilliance of Jeremy are that he is a slightly loose cannon, you're not quite sure what he's going to do next.'There is an unpredictability coupled with creative genius.

Both the Birmingham City winger and the Swansea captain have a fear of flying so will look to each other for support when the Welsh squad head to the skies on Thursday. Belgium\u2019s match in Israel originally scheduled for last September was postponed until this month because of the Gaza conflict. But simply being 30,000 feet high will be of concern to Cotterill. Swansea and Wales defender Ashley Williams has a fear of flying. He laughed: \u2018I\u2019m a nervous wreck on every flight I go on, it doesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s to. Normally when I\u2019m flying I grab my two children\u2019s hands. \u2018When I\u2019m on my own, Ashley Williams is across from me and he\u2019s a nervous flier too, we just look at each other like we\u2019re having a panic attack. \u2018He\u2019s a warrior on the pitch but when it comes to flying he\u2019s a little baby.\u2019 Cotterill has played an important part in Wales travelling to the Middle East with designs on topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group on departure. The 27-year-old came off the bench in the win over Cyprus earlier in the campaign to score a long-range free-kick, before starting the goalless draw in Belgium. \u2018It was an amazing result for us. In previous years we would probably have gone over there and got beaten three or four nil,\u2019 he told Sportsmail. Swansea defender Williams regarded as a fearless competitor on the pitch. \u2018I think the squad has improved so much, and we have great confidence. Hopefully we can do something special by qualifying.\u2019 Wales have not made a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup but sit second in Group B on eight points, one behind Israel having played a game more. Belgium are fourth on five points with a game in hand on Wales. Cotterill made his debut a decade ago as a 17-year-old, coming on to replace Ryan Giggs, so is well placed to chart the strides taken by this Wales team and how Gareth Bale has grown in dressing room stature. \u2018We have great experience, he said. \u2018Baley, Rambo (Aaron Ramsey) and (Chris) Gunter have a lot of caps for their age, obviously brought through from the days of (John) Toshack and (Gary) Speed. \u2018A lot of us have been together for many years and that\u2019s only benefitting us now. The group is a lot closer now than in previous years and it\u2019s showing on the pitch.\u2019 He added: \u2018Baley\u2019s signed for Real Madrid and he is one of our leaders. He does speak a lot more than he used to. Whatever he says he\u2019s talking sense because he\u2019s playing for one of the best managers in the world. He knows his stuff.\u2019 Bale\u2019s presence, despite his difficult spell at Real, encourages Cotterill to believe Wales can beat Israel, who have a perfect record so far. Birmingham winger David Cotterill (centre) will be part of the Wales squad flying to Israel. \u2018We\u2019ve got one of the best players in the world, if that doesn\u2019t give you a lift nothing will. Most of our starting XI are in the Premier League playing week in week out. Our core is quality. We show respect but we have nothing to fear.\u2019 Cotterill has enjoyed a bright season at Birmingham, revived under Gary Rowett, having moved from Doncaster last summer. He has eight goals from the right wing and seven assists, numbers that compete with any players in is position in the Championship. \u2018I\u2019m happy the way the season has gone, I\u2019m hoping to score more goals and get to the double figure mark, hopeful add a few more assists,\u2019 he said. \u2018Then I could look back at a successful season.\u2019"}

The Argentina forward, who sat out training on Friday due to a foot problem, has already picked up three jerseys in the US capital, where Argentina are due to play a friendly against El Salvador in front of 50,000 fans at FedEx Field. Lionel Messi was forced to watch from the sidelines as Argentina held a training session on Friday. The Argentina star cut a lonely figure as his team-mates took part in training session at FedEx Field. Messi picked up the foot injury during Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid on Sunday. Messi had been expected to feature in Saturday's friendly after a scan cleared him to play. First up fittingly was a Wizards shirt after the four-time World Player of the Year  joined his team-mates to watch Wednesday's NBA clash against\u00a0Indiana Pacers. Then Messi was presented with No 10 jerseys on Friday by Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin. 'I'm a big fan, and my wife loves soccer - or football,' Griffin told CSNwashington.com. 'We follow [soccer] all the time and follow the World Cup. I do keep track on these guys, from Messi to Ronaldinho to [Cristiano] Ronaldo. It really is great fun to watch them excel at a sport that I never got to play organised.'

The Turin giants have no interest in selling the France international, who has been a big hit since arriving at Juve in 2012 after leaving Manchester United as a free agent. 'There are clubs that are ready to spend 70 to 80 million euros for Pogba,' Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta told Italian radio station Radio Deejay. Paul Pogba scores Juventus' winning goal against Sassuolo in Turin earlier this month. The 22-year-old midfielder is a target for clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta is not interested in selling Pogba for big money this summer. 'There are many suitors for Pogba, but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us. 'If we want to increase our level, we need players of great quality and Pogba is one of them.' The 22-year-old midfielder has been strongly linked with a move to Paris St Germain at the end of the season while Chelsea, Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid are also reportedly keen to acquire his services. Pogba has scored seven goals and set up two more in 22 league appearances to help Juve remain on course for their fourth successive scudetto. The Frenchman is under contract with the Turin giants until June 2019. Marotta did reveal that Juve are keeping a close eye on Palermo's Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala. The Serie A giants are keen on  Palermo's Paulo Dybala, who has scored 12 league goals this season. The 21-year-old, who has been watched by a number of Premier League clubs, is out of contract in 2016. Dybala, 21, has been impressive this season for the Sicilian outfit, scoring 12 goals while providing seven assists in 27 league games. 'Dybala is a very interesting youngster, who not only has attracted our attention but (that) of other teams too,' Marotta said. 'We are looking to see what is out there in order to form a strong attacking line.' Dybala moved to Palermo in 2012 from home-town club Instituto and helped them gain promotion to Italy's top flight in the 2013-14 campaign. The South American turned down a contract extension earlier this year and becomes a free agent in June 2016."}

A candidate hoping to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky claims he was arrested for not returning an overdue library book. Johnathan Masters, 33,  was pulled over by a state trooper on Wednesday and apparently taken to jail over a book he withdrew 11 years ago. Masters - who says the charge is nonsense - claims the officer initially pulled him over for having expired tax stickers on his car. An online booking record for Masters says only that he was arrested for an outstanding warrant. But he says he was told the reason was a theft charge, linked to allegedly borrowing the book and never giving it back,  the\u00a0Huffington Post\u00a0reported. Masters denies the apparent charge - theft by failure to make required disposition of property - and says he will clear his name in court. Defending himself to Fox News, he said he had never even withdrawn a library book in Kenton County, where he claims the charge originates. Of the arrest, Masters said: 'I thought he was going to let me go because he was real friendly, but then he went back to his patrol car and was gone for about 15 minutes. 'When he came back, he asked me, \"Did you take out a library book 11 years ago?\" 'I started to laugh, but he said, \"This is serious!\" and he took me to jail for three hours. I plan to fight the charges.' Masters was let out of jail after paying a $100 bond, and is expected to appear in court later this month. He has been beset by legal troubles since his candidacy emerged. He is the running-mate of Geoff Young, who mounted a failed bid for Congress in 2014. Governor's race: Masters is running with Geoff Young, left, in the Democratic primary against front-runner Jack Conway, the state's Attorney General (right) The two hope to defeat front runner Jack Conway, the state Attorney General, in the Democratic primary elections this May. As part of his campaign, Young issued a lawsuit against Conway and other leading Democrats, accusing them of ignoring his campaign to secure victory in the primary. In the legal complaint he compares incumbent governor Steve Beshear to Stalin. Should they win, they would then face the Republican candidate in November's general election. According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, Masters is also waiting for his day in court on harassment charges. He is accused of making expletive-laden calls to an associate dean at Spalding University, demanding his money back after being kicked out of the school. The paper also reported that there is a pending arrest warrant over claims he threatened to beat up a principal after being told he couldn't enter a school to conduct a survey. He reportedly yelled 'come out here so I can kick your ass' in the December 17 visit. He has yet to be served with the warrant in the second case. Masters runs a political blog\u00a0called The Freedom Skool. His entries include several long posts about the medicinal benefits of marijuana, and a string of multi-colored, edited photographs of his running-mate. In response to the harassment charges, Patrick Hughes, chairman of the Kentucky Democrats, told the Courier-Journal that Masters and Young 'don't have a snowball's chance' of victory. Speaking to Daily Mail Online today, Young said he is'standing behind' Masters despite the accusations. Of the library book, he said: 'I don't think it says much about whether he's fit for office'."}

The New York Post\u00a0on Saturday claimed that Valerie Jarrett, a close confidant of both the president and First Lady Michelle Obama, divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. The bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated to reporters on Monday that the report wasn't true, though. Scroll down for video. A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and likely presidential candidate was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State. Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, reportedly leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends. \u2018It's utter baloney,' he said after a reporter asked him about the rumor at his regular briefing with the press. He did not comment further on the matter. According to the New York Post article, authored by Edward Klein, a source close to the White House disclosed that 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president.' 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the Democrat Party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the Clintons, who she believed had begun'marginalizing the president' and were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' She reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high-profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, the president and the first lady, reportedly sat down with Clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett is reported to have been speaking to\u00a0Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She\u2019s promised O\u2019Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' a source who spoke to Klein allegedly said. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O\u2019Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016. She has also reportedly reached out to\u00a0Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary. Klein, the author of\u00a0Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also says he spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they\u2019ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they\u2019re spreading rumors that I\u2019ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who\u2019d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' And it's not over yet, as according to Klein, six additional probes into Clinton's performance are underway. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, having discussed it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' Klein claimed. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama\u2019s longest serving advisers. She said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'"}

The episode marks the first rescue of a leatherback sea turtle in South Carolina and is believed to be only the fifth live rescue of this species in the United States, according to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The endangered turtle was found stranded on the Yawkey-South Island Preserve, a wildlife refuge near Georgetown, South Carolina. Rescuers named it Yawkey. Because the turtle is believed to be a juvenile -- rescuers say it's probably less than 10 years old -- and has not reached sexual maturity, biologists can't yet determine its sex. Rescuers found no external signs of trauma to the reptile, although it was hypoglycemic. Staffers with the aquarium's sea turtle rescue program gave it antibiotics, vitamins and some time to recover at their facilities. The treatments appear to be helping. Aquarium officials said the turtle was more energetic Tuesday than when it was first admitted. Even so, leatherback turtles historically don't do well in captivity. For that reason, aquarium staffers are working with the state's Department of Natural Resources to determine the best place and time to release the turtle back into the ocean -- most likely within the next few days. Leatherbacks are the largest turtles on Earth and can grow up to 2,000 pounds. They are found throughout the world's oceans and have been spotted as far north as Norway and as far south as South America."}

During this time, scientists will study the effects of long-duration space flights on the human body, and Kelly's identical twin brother Mark will participate in NASA's \"Twins Study\" to compare the two. Finally, the mission will help prepare for future space exploration, such as a one-way trip to Mars.", "article": "(CNN)NASA astronaut Scott Kelly has started a trip to the record books. He plans to spend 342 days on the International Space Station -- the longest stretch of time any U.S. astronaut has spent in space. Kelly lifted off Friday aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan. The rocket docked at the ISS at 9:33 p.m. ET, according to a tweet from NASA, with hatches between the Soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. ET. Kelly will stay twice as long as any U.S. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station, giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long-duration space flights. On Earth, scientists will perform parallel studies on Scott Kelly's identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. \"It's a lot of fun,\" Kelly said at a media briefing in January. \"Space station is a magical place.\" Two cosmonauts are riding up with Kelly: Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka. Kornienko also will stay up for a year. Padalka will only stay up for six months. The trio will join three crew members already on the space station: U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just Kelly and Kornienko on the station. Kelly, 51, hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin. They spent over seven months on the ISS -- from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. He is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission. When added to his previous space missions, that would give him a total of 522 days in space, breaking the record of U.S. astronaut Mike Fincke. Fincke spent a combined 381 days, 15 hours and 11 minutes in space, according to his official NASA bio. While Kelly shoots to set space station and other U.S. records, Padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human. He's already spent more than 710 days in space, including stays on Russia's Mir space station and three previous stints on the International Space Station. Why do it? Why stay up on the station so long? NASA wants to know more about the impact of long-duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to Mars and deeper into space. And the space station, in orbit 250 miles above Earth, is the best place available to study that. Spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll. NASA says space station astronauts have vision changes, bone loss, muscle atrophy and other problems. NASA says the experiments should have benefits on Earth, such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections. The space station has about the same living space as a six-bedroom, two bathroom house. And it has a 360-degree bay window with a great view. But astronauts and cosmonauts still report feeling isolated and confined at times. Kelly will document his feelings about being away from his two children and the rest of his family. \"I'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience,\" Kelly said. He also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long-term space flight. Will he tell all? \"I plan to be completely honest about it,\" he said, but... \"who knows, maybe there are some crazy thoughts I'll have at the end that I wouldn't want to share.\" Mark Kelly has volunteered for NASA's \"Twins Study\" to see how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments. He is the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who left office after being wounded in a January 2011 assassination attempt. \"He thinks it's great that he can still be a participant in this,\" Scott Kelly said. So Mark will be on Earth getting poked and prodded by researchers -- while Scott makes history in orbit. Final candidates announced for one-way trip to Mars."}

Durst is currently being investigated for the shooting death of Susan Berman in 2000 and police say wife Debrah Lee Charatan, 58, allegedly tried to help Durst flee to Cuba before his recent arrest. The New York Post reports that Charatan, who married Durst less than two weeks before Berman's death, could face a federal charge of aiding and abetting a flight to avoid prosecution. Los Angeles authorities say are building a criminal case against millionaire Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan (pictured in 2012 and 2014) and she may testify against her husband to avoid criminal charges.

Durst was preparing to fly to Cuba when he was arrested on March 14 and police believe that Charatan was going to meet him there or help him flee. The Post reports that police are going over Charatan's financial records to look for money transfers or other incriminating evidence. Charatan was in Florida which is just 90 miles from Cuba when Durst was arrested in New Orleans. 'She knew this was coming and that [Durst] was going to be arrested and this was all going to blow up,' a police source told The Post.

On Friday, Millionaire Robert Durst's attorneys claim that he was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered Susan Berman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, William Gibbens and Dick DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They say he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on.... They're gonna find nothing,\" Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told  KTRK-TV.

They're gonna find nothing, Dick DeGuerin (pictured), the lead attorney on Durst's team, said on Friday. The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. The six-part documentary concluded Sunday. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings \u2014 that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. In the case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst"}

Scroll down for video. Dyson inventor Sir James Dyson has invested $15 million (\u00a310 million) in Michigan-based Sakti3. The firm has developed a solid-state battery capable of storing double the amount of power as traditional lithium-ion models. The batteries could feature in Dyson's cordless cleaners as well as phones and other gadgets. It is the first investment Sir James has made outside of his bagless vacuum business. Batteries have three main components - the anode, cathode and electrolyte. This electrolyte is typically a chemical that separates the anode and cathode and moves the flow of electrical charge between the two. The majority of batteries found in phones, electric cars and Sir James' range of cordless vacuums use lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte and because lithium is a highly-reactive element it stores a large amount of energy. But this liquid electrolyte is often flammable and has been blamed for batteries bursting into flames when overheated, for example. Due to the safety implications of placing flammable liquids in electric cars, too, many of these auto-based batteries have added safety features making them expensive to run. Lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte but this liquid electrolyte is  flammable. Sakti3's SSBs are based on the same Li-ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal. This makes them safer, smaller, (pictured) more robust and mean they can be used at higher temperatures. In particular the battery has to be cooled down and can never fully charge or discharge resulting in wasted capacity. Batteries have three main components - the anode, cathode and electrolyte.

This is said to be 50 per cent higher than than current lithium-ion batteries. The firm has also demonstrated its prototype can survive more charge-discharge cycles than traditional Li-ion batteries which typically  last two or three years - whether they are used or not. Other companies including Toyota are also working on developing similar technology. Sir James' investment in Sakti3 is part of a larger $20miillion (\u00a313 million) round of investment that will see the technology sold commercially and added to Dyson products. This would include the firm's latest cordless V6 Fluffy designed to work with wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring. Sir James said: 'Sakti3 has achieved leaps in performance which current battery technology simply can't. It's these fundamental technologies - batteries, motors - that allow machines to work properly. 'The Sakti3 team has amazing ambitions, and their platform offers the potential for exponential performance gains that will supercharge the Dyson machines we know today.'

Researchers have found that some species were short - measuring under five feet tall - while others would have grown to heights of almost six foot. The study is the first in 20 years to compare the body size of humans who lived between 1.5 million and 2.5 million years ago. Early humans living in Africa almost two million years ago came in a range of shapes and sizes, just as people do today, a new study claims. This image shows the skeleton of the \u2018Nariokotome Boy\u2019 (Homo ergaster) Three species are generally recognised to have roamed Africa during this time frame: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo ergaster. Researcher Dr Jay Stock, from Cambridge University's Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, said: 'If someone asked you 'are modern humans six foot tall and 70kg?' you'd say 'well, some are, but many people aren't, and what we're starting to show is that this diversification happened really early in human evolution.' Nutrition and local environmental factors probably played a role in making some early humans larger than others. Experts also believe that sexual dimorphism (pronounced differences in appearance between males and females, such as size) might have played a part too. \u2018However, almost all studied\u2026 groups include smaller and larger individuals and assessing sex based on the isolated and fragmentary postcranial remains of early Homo is nearly impossible,\u2019 they say in the study. Another possibility, thought to be less likely, is that there were numerous species belonging to the human family Homo that varied in appearance. Measurements of fossils from sites in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Georgia in eastern Europe, revealed significant regional variation in the size of early humans during the last Ice Age. Some groups, such as those living Olduvai, Tanzania, measured just 4.8 feet on average, while those from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya grew to heights of 5.8 feet. The evidence also suggests that big bodies and long legs were not prerequisites for spreading out of Africa into Europe and Asia. The main increase in body size occurred tens of thousands of years after the small, primitive human Homo erectus migrated out of Africa. Fossils show that Homo erectus, which averaged less than five foot in height and weighed less than eight stone, was living in Georgia 1.77 million years ago. Some groups, such as those living Olduvai, Tanzania, measured just 4.8 feet on average, while those from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya grew to heights of almost six foot. A table showing the variation is pictured. Measurements of fossils from sites in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Georgia in eastern Europe, revealed significant regional variation in the size of early humans during the last Ice Age. This the landscape of the West Turkana region of Kenya is where the skeleton of Homo ergaster was found. 'The evolution of larger bodies and longer legs can no longer be assumed to be the main driving factor behind the earliest excursions of our genus to Eurasia,' said co-author Manuel Will, from Tubingen University in Germany. The scientists, whose findings are reported in the Journal of Human Evolution, developed a method of calculating the height and body mass of individuals from small fossil fragments, some no bigger than toes. Dr Stock said: 'In human evolution we see body size as one of the most important characteristics, and from examining these'scrappier' fossils we can get a much better sense of when and where human body size diversity arose. 'Before 1.7 million years ago our ancestors were seldom over five foot tall or particularly heavy in body mass. 'When this significant size shift to much heavier, taller individuals happened, it occurred primarily in one particular place - in a region called Koobi Fora in northern Kenya around 1.7 million years ago. 'That means we can now start thinking about what regional conditions drove the emergence of this diversity, rather than seeing body size as a fixed and fundamental characteristic of a species.' \u2018The results demonstrate chronological and spatial variation, but no simple temporal or. geographical trends for the evolution of body size among early Homo\u2026.suggesting that migrations into Eurasia were not contingent on larger body sizes,\u2019 the study says. Body size has been implicated as a factor contributing to both brain evolution and the first hominin dispersals into Eurasia. One argument suggests that as lower limbs lengthened and hominins assumed limb proportions more similar to modern humans, they became more mobile and changed their foraging behaviour and diet. But fossil fragments have now shown a richer variety of sizes and this may not be the case. The ecomorphological model says that Homo ergaster was the first hominin to colonize other continents due to its energetically efficient bipedal locomotion, long distance travel abilities,"}

He has a little bit of a joke, but he's just a relaxed, calm guy. He comes in and does his work and is humble, just like everyone else is.

Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer. Thrower: Christian Englander, 30, of Santa Fe, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and battery. He told police he was angry at comments Chappelle made about his friend that night. Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him. The friend reportedly was drawing in a sketchbook during the show at Lensic theater Monday night when Chappelle noticed and asked the man his name, which he gave as 'Johnny Appleseed,' Santa Fe police spokesperson Andrea Dobyns said. Chappelle then made jokes about the moniker, the police spokeswoman said,'so that's when Englander got upset.' According to TMZ, the man thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket after consuming a banana and washing it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas at a convenience store before the show. Arresting officers said Englander appeared to be intoxicated after event security escorted him outside. Racial attack: Chappelle told police Englander did not seem remorseful, and he believed the banana attack was racially motivated. Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Chappelle has had his share of run-ins with audience members in the past. Fueled up: Englander said he ate the banana and washed it down with a shot of 99 Bananas liquor before the show. In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling. Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005. Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.\u2019 A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said:'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.' Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander. Once Englander was removed from the venue, Chappelle resumed his routine but spent the remainer of his set harping on the fruit fracas. \u2018First I'm going to kill him with my comedy then I'm going to kick him in his f***ing face,\u2019 he said, according to an audio recording made by an audience member and shared online. \u2018By the way, these are empty threats.\u2019 He later expressed a desire to hurl a tuna casserole in his assailant's face and to choke the life out of him - but noted that he wouldn't do it because it's against the law. The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket. \u2018Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,\u2019 he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him. \u2018I wish I could be, \u201cI can't believe this is happening,\u201d but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,\u2019 Chappelle told the crowd. \u2018I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.' The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network. \u2018Key and Peele probably did that s***,\u2019 he joked, referring to the banana throw. \u2018Key and Banana Peel.\u2019 Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night"}

One the ISS three crew members remain, and another three will join on 27 March - including two who will become the first to spend a year continuously on the station. Scroll down for video. What a view: Three astronauts have returned from the ISS after a six-month stay aboard the orbiting space station. The Soyuz TMA-14M (shown) took slightly more than three hours to return after leaving the ISS. This stunning image was taken from a helicopter as the capsule parachuted back to the ground by Nasa photographer Bill Ingalls. This landing brought to an end Expedition 42, carrying with it commander Barry Wilmore of Nasa and flight engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Serova was the first Russian female cosmonaut to work on the station in two decades. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft, which brought them back to Earth, departed from the space station at 10.44pm GMT on Wednesday. It took them just over three hours to return. 'We wish you a good flight and a soft landing,' the remaining crew on the ISS said to the departing crew. After a few hours of free flight, the Soyuz burned its engine for four minutes and 41 seconds, reducing its velocity enough for it to plummet through the atmosphere, with the crew module separating from the other superfluous sections. Once through the atmosphere, a parachute deployed and brought the Soyuz to a relatively gentle - but still quite bumpy - landing on the ground. Extracted from the capsule, which was charred on re-entry, the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks, bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures. 'Everything is great, thank you. The guys are great and worked very well,' said a smiling Serova while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure. 'Congratulations on the recent holiday,' a rescue and recovery team officer said to Serova, referring to the International Women's Day marked on 8 March. 'Everything is fine. I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev said with a smile. 'I am glad to be here,' Wilmore said in Russian before the three got into all-terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area.

Although he was technically given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in the heavy crash, the fear of'second-impact syndrome' forced him out of the start of the racing season. The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, he said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' #countdownMalaysia.' Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia. For the Albert Park event his seat will be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007. Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013. Alonso's McLaren is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck after crashing in Barcelona."}

{"abstract": "Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 74.1 per cent of mothers with children under 16 are now participating in the labour market, which is the same rate as women without children. This is a significant change from the mid-1990s when only two thirds of mothers had jobs. The change is attributed to government policies such as increased childcare subsidies and free early education for three to four-year-olds.", "article": "Mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children, figures showed yesterday. The historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed 74.1 per cent of mothers with children under 16, or between 16 and 18 if they are still at school, are regarded as \u2018participating in the labour market\u2019. By comparison, 75 per cent of women without dependent children were either in work or looking for a job last year. Mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children, figures showed yesterday. In the mid-1990s, only two thirds of mothers had jobs, while then, as now, three in four childless women were working. The gap has closed because there are now half a million more women with children under five in work, or looking for jobs, than in 1996. There are also 200,000 more women with children aged between five and ten in the labour market. Mothers were briefly more likely to have jobs than women without families in 2013, the ONS report revealed, but last year more than 350,000 childless women entered the growing labour market. The latest figures will be welcomed by Coalition ministers. Chancellor George Osborne said in his Budget speech on Wednesday that a key element of the Government\u2019s \u2018massive moment\u2019 in job creation, giving Britain its highest-ever employment rate, was \u2018more women in work than ever before\u2019. Ministers have claimed credit for raising state subsidies for childcare from \u00a32billion to \u00a33billion a year since 2010. But critics of the Government\u2019s drive for more mothers to go out to work say many are reluctant to do so and would prefer to stay at home to bring up their children. The historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children (picture posed by models) Author and family commentator Jill Kirby said the figures were a result of government efforts to persuade mothers that \u2018children are better off in childcare\u2019, adding: \u2018Children are losing out \u2013 a string of different childcare workers is no substitute for the love of a mother.\u2019 Imogen Thompson, of the pressure group Mothers at Home Matter, said: \u2018We question whether this is what all women want, or whether many are forced into returning to the labour market before they feel they, or their children, are ready.\u2019 The new estimates are based on the large-scale Labour Force Survey covering women who either have jobs or are unemployed and looking for work. The ONS report said benefit changes that have pressed single parents into looking for work may have influenced the change. It added: \u2018Other government policies, for example to fund 570 hours of free early education childcare a year in England for all three to four-year-olds, will have provided additional incentives to engage with the labour market.\u2019 The biggest change has been among mothers of children under five. In 1996, 1.6million of them were in the labour market, compared with 2.1million last year. This represents a rise from 54.5 per cent of mothers of under-fives in work in 1996 to 65 per cent now. More mothers of older children are also working, but the rise has been much less steep, while the rates for women without dependents have not changed in nearly 20 years. The report said 74.5 per cent of all adult women had jobs in 2014, compared with 71.3 per cent in 1994. The most popular jobs for women are either in teaching and education, or \u2018caring personal services\u2019, including medical work, or in shops."}
{"abstract": "Andy Murray is one win away from achieving 500 career victories, which would make him the first British tennis player to do so. If he beats South African Kevin Anderson in the fourth round of the Miami Open, he could also move up to No 3 in the world rankings. Murray is set to marry long-term partner Kim Sears next week following the tournament in Miami.", "article": "Before getting married next week, there are a couple of things Andy Murray would like to achieve in his last tournament as a single man. The immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories \u2014 he is within one win of doing so after beating Colombia\u2019s Santiago Giraldo 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of the Miami Open. Murray can pass the mark on Tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant South African Kevin Anderson. Andy Murray could become the first British tennis player to win 500 career games if he beats Kevin Anderson. Should Murray survive that encounter, it is possible he could edge ahead of Rafael Nadal and move back up to No 3 in the world rankings, although that also depends on the performances of others here. Going past 500 is something nobody can take away from him, however, and it will stand as testament to his consistency at the top of the game. Since tennis went open in 1968 \u2014 the old barriers between amateurs and professionals torn down to make a unified circuit \u2014 only 45 men have clocked that many wins. Only eight who are currently active have managed it. Murray defeatedSantiago Giraldo of Columbia in their third round match during the Miami Open. No British player in that time has got there, Tim Henman pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark. Murray said: \u2018It\u2019s nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there aren\u2019t loads. \u2018Even if it doesn\u2019t happen here then at some stage I\u2019m sure I will get there. Murray could leap ahead of Rafael Nadal in the rankings if he beats Anderson in the fourth round. \u2018I obviously want to win more and hopefully I still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number. \u2018It\u2019s not easy in this era to win that many matches, so it\u2019s a good sign.\u2019 Of those Murray victories, 24 have come so far at this event, making it his most productive Masters level tournament. Murray and Giraldo shake hands after their match which saw the Scot progress to the next round. Factors like it being a familiar training base for Murray \u2014 he has a home only three miles away from this Key Biscayne island site \u2014 and the tendency for it to be windy during the tournament have all contributed to that. He is one of the best at adapting to such conditions. After two days of unsettled weather that have hardly enhanced South Florida\u2019s reputation for reliable sunshine, it was a regulation glorious morning as he kicked off the programme against Giraldo, one of the steady trickle of decent tennis players who come out of Colombia. The No 27 seed, who beat Murray in their previous meeting on the clay of Madrid last year, is the kind of opponent who illustrates that racking up the wins on the ATP Tour is hardly a straightforward endeavour. Murray's form is improving as the season continues and he looks in good shape for Wimbledon. He gives the ball an almighty biff from the back court but was slowly unpicked by Murray\u2019s clever mix of angles and spins. The Scot definitely looks a better player than he did a year ago, although the tendency towards the odd lapse in concentration is still evident. He let the South American, as usual enjoying good support in this part of the world, creep back from 5-1 down in the second set but then served it out at the second time of asking. Murray is set to marry long-term partner Kim Sears (right) next week following the tournament in Miami."}

A Chicago woman has been charged in the killing of her 7-month-old granddaughter, who had her throat cut with a power saw after being suffocated with a sock and beaten to death. Police have said the baby girl, Rose Herrera, was killed Monday, apparently because she would not stop crying. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office said Tuesday that the baby's 52-year-old grandmother, Manuela Rodriguez, was charged with first-degree murder in baby Rose's death. An autopsy concluded that the baby was already dead when her throat was slashed. It also found that not only was the girl struck in the head with an object, but that she also likely suffocated on a sock that was \u2018placed in her mouth,\u2019 according to a county medical examiner's log that includes the infant's death. Rodriguez, who police say attempted to take her own life after the attack, was taken to a hospital for treatment for injuries that were not considered life threatening. The State's Attorney's Office said Rodriguez is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Police were called at around 9.40am to a multi-family home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with 'visible trauma.' The child was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators said before the suspect took a circular saw to the child's body, she tried to quiet her down by stuffing a sock down her throat. Following the  killing, Manuela Rodriguez reportedly attempted to take her own life. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in a stable condition. Residents of the quiet street in the predominantly Hispanic Little Village neighborhood where Rose was killed said the Rodriguez had some health problems but was always pleasant. Officers found the child, identified by family members as Rosie, after being called Monday morning to a building on the city's West Side (pictured) State child welfare officials said they had no record of ever being called to the brick home. Neighbors said the woman and her family were always polite and did not cause trouble. \u2018She would help everybody and if you needed a glass of milk or something she would give it to you,\u2019 said Maria Gentil, who has known Rodriguez for several years and said she was a doting grandmother. \u2018When my mother died, she went up and down the street asking for money for her funeral.\u2019 Ben Llamas works with the child's father and drove him to the scene. Mr Llamas told the Chicago Tribune the father was upset but did not talk about what happened. His friend had moved in to that house about a year ago with a woman, Llamas said. The couple had a young child. \u2018At first, he was reluctant, but when the baby came, he fell in love,\u2019 Llamas said. \u2018He shows us pictures of that baby every day.\u2019 Neighbors said several people live in the home where the baby was found. \u2018They were really good people,\u2019 Francisco Arreola told the Chicago Tribune in Spanish. \u2018I would always see them and they were very happy.

Jose Mourinho's team led twice in this turbulent encounter but twice allowed PSG to level, with captain Thiago Silva heading the vital second, six minutes from the end of extra-time. Ibrahimovic, dismissed for a tackle on Oscar in the first-half, said: 'I don't know if I have to get angry or start to laugh. For me when I saw the red card I was like \"the guy doesn't know what he's doing\". 'That is not the worst. The worst is when I got the red card all the Chelsea players come around. It felt like I had a lot of babies around me.' Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutchman sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (far right) on 31 minutes. Ibrahimovic heads into a challenge with Chelsea midfielder Oscar (left) in the first-half which saw him sent off. The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar. Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho said he hoped the red card could be overturned but also bemoaned a penalty not given for a trip on Diego Costa and what he thought might be an elbow on Costa by David Luiz. The Chelsea manager also blamed his own players for failing to deal with their numerical advantage, wilting under expectations and conceding twice from set-pieces. 'When a team cannot defend two corners a team doesn't deserve to win,' said Mourinho. 'We couldn't cope with the pressure. For them it was easy, two lines of four, counter-attack, waiting for the right moment. Mentally for them with 10 there is nothing to lose. Chelsea players look dejected after being dumped out of the Champions League at home to PSG. 'Our performance was not good enough. The opponent was stronger than us, they coped better with the pressure of the game. Because they had 10 men we felt more the pressure of winning and they had nothing to lose. 'We couldn't cope with that, we conceded two goals in two set pieces. That is difficult to accept. For me it was a surprise. I am disappointed, but I try always to be pragmatic and honest. The first feeling was that we deserved to lose. We didn't deserve to go through. 'It's not the moment to explain. We will analyse it. We need to react. We have a Premier League to win. I told that to the players. We lost a competition where even if we win today there are other big teams to beat. 'We have the Premier League to win and we are in a good situation. There's no time to cry. Move on, and look forward.' Former Chelsea man David Luiz gestures towards Blues striker Diego Costa during Wednesday's encounter. PSG defender  Luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at Stamford Bridge. Thiago Silva's late header loops over the outstretched arm of Thibaut Courtois to knock Chelsea out. On Ibrahimovic's red card, Mourinho said: 'I spoke to him after the game and when he speaks with me he's always honest. He would tell me if it was a reason for a red card, and he was very disappointed so if that's the case, I hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter-final. If he did nothing wrong, he deserves that. 'But the other situations, it was a clear penalty on Diego Costa and, once more, I think it's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal. If he cannot see a penalty 10 metres when it's completely clear, it's a waste of time and money. 'The David elbow I didn't see, I confess. But when UEFA give him the man of the match, I have to believe there's no elbow. Perhaps they cannot give us the penalty but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend David and take Ibra into the quarter-finals.' Ibrahimovic also suggested Oscar feigned injury. 'I pulled out (of the tackle), because I saw him come in the tackle. 'I don't know if he was acting afterwards. Doesn't matter. We won the game, we went through and let's see what happens.' Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he hopes Ibrahimovic is able to have his red card overturned. It was ill-tempered with Sky Sports pundits Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness very critical of the behaviour by Mourinho's players, especially their attempts to get Ibrahimovic sent off. Carragher called it 'disgraceful' and Souness called it 'pathetic'. Luiz equalised for PSG in the 86th minute, to take the game into extra time after Gary Cahill had volleyed Chelsea ahead.

Now, scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage \u2013 at least when it comes to salaries. A study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Despite working just as hard, they are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked. Researchers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers' productivity and pay. A\u00a0University of Sheffield\u00a0study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Their study found: 'More agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market, but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting.' They defined agreeableness as being compliant, modest, trustworthy and sympathetic. The study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits, perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap. Being agreeable made workers more successful in team work, but had three negative effects on their performance. Friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked, according to the study. 'First, helping others may reduce individual productivity,' the study found. 'Secondly, agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage. Finally, agreeable individuals may enter less stable, lower paid occupations.' The study was presented at the Royal Economic Society's 2015 annual conference in Manchester yesterday by Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of The University of Sheffield, who conducted the research alongside Australian and Spanish academics. They analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the University of New South Wales in laboratory conditions, and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages. It found that, while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money, being too open could harm your career. While openness with colleagues indicated an artistic, curious and imaginative worker, it could make them less likely to obey the rules, which could cause problems at a formal workplace. Neuroticism, which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability, also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self-confidence and were insecure."}

Kirsty Summers, 27, met her husband, Darren Summers, 34, through a cancer support forum. As they chatted, they discovered they only lived three miles away from each other in Lincoln and their mothers both suffered from inflammatory breast cancer. Kirsty and her husband Darren were bought together through a cancer support group and have gone on to have two children together Jack, five and Isabelle, two. As mother's day approaches Kirsty Summers has revealed how hard it will be to spend the day without her mother Carol who died just eight days after her wedding. But while Maureen Summers recovered, Carol Mellars was given just months to live, forcing the couple to bring their wedding forward. Despite being confined to a wheelchair and on oxygen, she managed to watch her daughter walk down the aisle and whisper: 'You look like a princess.' She died just eight days later, aged 50. Now Mrs Summers has paid tribute to her mum for finding her 'perfect man'. The baby sign language teacher said: 'She was so happy the day I got married and I'll always have her to thank for finding my perfect man. 'Mum being diagnosed was the worst thing that happened to me but it ended up leading to the best thing that happened to me.' The couple have had two children together since their wedding in 2008, Jack, five, and Isabelle, two. On Sunday, Mrs Summers will remember the tragic circumstances she met her husband in. She said: 'Mother's Day has become easier to cope with now I have the kids and they can make their own little presents. Sarah was pleased her mother Carol, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2007, got to attend her wedding. Kirsty, pictured with Darren, has paid tribute to her mother for helping her find the perfect man. 'That gives things a nicer focus but it's always bittersweet.' Ms Mellars was first diagnosed with grade-three inflammatory breast cancer in 2007. This meant that the cancer had spread from her breast to her lymph nodes. When she was undergoing her first round of gruelling chemotherapy, devastated Mrs Summers joined an online support forum. 'When Darren and I started messaging, the main topic of conversation was always about our mums,' she said. 'But then we got to talking about other things, like hobbies and how much we had in common. 'It just felt like there was a bit of a connection there.' After 10 days of chatting online, the pair arranged to meet at a coffee shop as friends. She said: 'I was looking forward to the prospect of meeting up with somebody and being able to honestly tell them how I was feeling and know that they were going through the exact same thing.' When Mr and Mrs Summers' relationship deepened, they introduced their mothers. Soon Ms Mellars and Maureen Summers, 67, also became great friends. 'I think their relationship was similar to mine and Darren's, they found someone they could talk to who knew exactly how they felt,' Mrs Summers said. Darren's mother Maureen (left) went on to be great friends with Kirsty's mother and the pair were pictured together at their children's wedding. In March 2008, six months after the couple met, Mr Summers, a graphic designer, proposed in front of Lincoln cathedral. The couple had something else to celebrate a month later when both their mothers were given the all clear. Mrs Summers said: 'We all went out for a meal. We had a lot to look forward to, and it was just brilliant.' But five months later, Ms Mellars developed a cough. 'One day Mum was struggling to breathe so she decided to go to hospital,' her daughter recalled. 'She packed herself a little bag, fed the cat and called herself a taxi. 'Most people would have got themselves an ambulance if they could barely breathe - but that was Mum.' Doctors ran a full body scan and blood tests which revealed the tragic truth \u2013 her cancer had returned. Darren's mother Maureen holds his and Kirsty's daughter Isabelle in a sweet family snap. Mrs Summers said: 'I got a voicemail from Mum asking me and Darren to come round because she wanted to talk to us. 'I just knew. I remember the car journey there - I've never been so hysterical in all of my life. 'We pulled into Mum's street and we hadn't even stopped driving when I jumped out. I just wanted to get to her as soon as I could. Kirsty continued: 'I banged on the door and when she opened it I fell straight into her arms and was just sobbing my heart out. 'She made us a cup of tea, even though I just wanted to sit down and talk about it - the usual good hostess. I said: 'it's back isn't it?' And she said yes and I started crying.' Ms Mellars told her daughter that the cancer had spread to her liver"}
{"abstract": "Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed reports that 18-year-old Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in Iraq on behalf of ISIS. Bilardi had reportedly kept a blog detailing his transition from an atheist school student to a soldier of the Khilafah, and had planned to launch a series of bombings in Melbourne. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described the situation as \"absolutely horrific\" and has warned young Australians not to be lured by the \"brutal terrorist organization\" of ISIS.", "article": "(CNN)Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the government is seeking to confirm reports that an Australian teenager has carried out a suicide attack on behalf of ISIS in Iraq. \"I can confirm that the Australian government is currently seeking to independently verify reports that 18-year-old Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in the Middle East,\" she told reporters. \"If these reports are confirmed, this is another tragic example of a young Australian being lured to a senseless and violent death by a brutal terrorist organization that is intent on imposing suffering and misery not only in Iraq and Syria but beyond.\" On Wednesday, ISIS claimed that \"Abu Abdullah al-Australi,\" along with four other foreign fighters, had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of Ramadi in Iraq. The claim, issued on a Twitter account associated with the Anbar provincial division of ISIS, was accompanied by a series of 20 images, including a photo of a young man who looked like Bilardi. The image appeared to show Bilardi at the wheel of a car with the caption, \"Abu Abdullah al-Australi (may Allah accept him), the attacker on the 8th Brigade.\" The other attackers hailed from Belgium, Syria, Uzbekistan and the Caucasus, the Twitter account claimed. Victoria police said Bilardi first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year. A search of his family's home in the Melbourne suburb of Craigieburn following his disappearance uncovered chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device, police said, although no actual bombs were found. Bishop said Bilardi's passport had been canceled in October on the advice of Australian security agencies. Australian media have reported that Bilardi kept a since-deleted blog, written under his alias Abu Abdullah al-Australi. Entitled \"From Melbourne to Ramadi: My Journey,\" it reportedly detailed his transition from an \"atheist school student in affluent Melbourne to a soldier of the Khilafah preparing to sacrifice my life for Islam.\" The blog reportedly described a plan to attack targets in Melbourne, after an initial attempt to move to Iraq or Syria failed. \"This plan involved launching a string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar,\" he wrote, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Member of Bilardi's family have linked the teen's radicalization to the loss of his mother from cancer. \"He's just a young boy that went looking for something after he lost someone very very dear to him, his mother,\" his aunt, Connie Bilardi, told CNN affiliate Seven on Monday. A former classmate of Bilardi's from Melbourne's Craigieburn Secondary College described the teen on Facebook as a \"shy kid who didn't like to be disturbed\". \"One day, he randomly got angry at me and tried to punch me,\" he posted. \"Always keep an eye out on the quiet ones.\" A former penpal of Bilardi told CNN he cut off communication with the teenager about two years ago, when Bilardi started posting Islamic extremist messages on his Facebook page. The friend, who requested not to be named, said he first met Bilardi on the website interpals.net about seven years ago. They shared a love for soccer -- Bilardi was a supporter of Chelsea Football Club -- and became penpals. Bilardi told him about his mother's death, and confided that he was fighting with his family, because they would not allow him to go overseas to study. The penpal said he started noticing a change in Bilardi's behavior when the teen started posting \"things that supported Osama bin Laden\" on Facebook. \"I got scared,\" the friend said. \"My friends here told me that maybe I should stop talking to him.\" He blocked Bilardi on the social networking site about two years ago. After a while, he said, he got curious about how his old penpal was doing. \"I thought he was my friend. I wanted to make sure he was okay... I sent him an email saying 'Are you well?' but he never wrote back.\" Bishop said that 90 Australian citizens are in Iraq and Syria fighting on the side of ISIS, and that at least 20 Australians have been killed in the conflict. The passports of some 100 Australians had been canceled on national security grounds, she said. Bishop appealed to young Australians \"not to fall victim to this brutal terrorist organization, to not be lured into believing that they're embarking on some adventure or some romantic endeavor.\" \"This is a brutal organization dedicated to creating misery and hardship,\" she said. \"Its activities of beheadings and executions and crucifixions all take us back to the dark ages.\" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott addressed Bilardi's alleged suicide attack in comments to the press Thursday. This is a horrific situation -- an absolutely horrific situation -- and it shows the lure of this death cult to impressionable youngsters,\""}

He sent her 'dark and spiteful' letters and accused her of sleeping her way to the top. He was warned to expect jail when he returns to court for sentencing next month.", "article": "NHS boss Karl Perryman, 52, was warned he faces jail after being found guilty of stalking female colleague Joanne O'Neill. A senior NHS manager who bombarded a female colleague with poison pen letters after she rejected his advances is facing jail. Karl Perryman was head of complaints and legal services at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he sent the 'dark and spiteful' notes to junior colleague Joanne O'Neill. Posing as a Christian woman, he also wrote to her partner, mother, the hospital and human resources manager accusing her of sleeping her way to the top. Perryman recruited Miss O'Neill as his 'prodigy,' but turned on her when she began a relationship with the hospital's deputy director of ICT Michael Brown, who she has since married. The letters had a devastating effect on 39-year-old Miss O'Neill who left her family and friends as she moved more than 200 miles away to escape Perryman. He was caught when officers found part of one of the letters on his computer. Married Perryman was found guilty at King's Lynn Crown Court of one count of stalking and one count of intimidating a witness - Ms O'Neill's mother Margaret Titmarsh. Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital, King's Lynn Crown Court was told. But Perryman  called her afterwards to say he was'so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job'. A couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to 'take her under his wing'. He described her as his 'prodigy' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave. The two shared friendly 'banter' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers Ernest Jones and she refused the gift. The first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in December 2012 and said Mr Brown had been 'bragging' about having sex with Miss O'Neill and another female member of staff. It claimed: 'Both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses\u2026 they are dressing like tarts. This is a hospital, not a knocking shop.' Perryman, 52, was the head of complaints and legal services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk, pictured, when he turned on his 'prodigy' One said: 'She has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians\u2026 one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top.' A few days later Miss O'Neill received a letter which accused her of 'plotting and scheming' for her own advantage. It warned: 'You will reap what you sow\u2026 we will listen to your corridor conversations, when you're in the bathroom, so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you've done.' Miss O'Neill, who is now married to Mr Brown, told the jury\u00a0Perryman, who was her line manager, said he would 'destroy' her if she told anyone about his bullying. She said: 'He made me feel like he got me the job, I had to be loyal and I owed him. 'He said there were women who didn't like the way I looked, his wife wouldn't like me because I was just his type, petite and blonde. The court heard police traced the letters to Perryman and found drafts on his computer. After his arrest he allegedly approached Mrs Titmarsh and threatened 'You don't know what's coming to you' while making a 'thumb across the throat' gesture. Perryman was warned to expect jail when he returns to King's Lynn Crown Court, pictured, for sentence next month. After the guilty verdicts, Judge Nicholas Coleman adjourned sentencing until April 17, but warned Perryman to expect to be jailed. He told him: 'I'm quite sure that you will continue to deny the allegations but I am satisfied the jury are entirely right in their decisions.' He added that the only question relating to Perryman's sentence is how long he will be jailed for. Perryman, of King's Lynn, Cambs., stood emotionless in the dock as the verdict was read to him. He was released on bail with a tag and ordered to obey a night time curfew. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital refused to confirm Perryman's employment status. Director of Human Resources Gerry Dryden said: 'The Trust acknowledges the verdict of the court in respect of its employee Karl Perryman. 'The Trust will now carefully consider the verdict and take such steps as it considers appropriate in the circumstances. 'It would be inappropriate for the Trust to comment further on this case at this time.'"}
{"abstract": "Scientists have discovered that viewing images of overweight or obese people can alter our sense of smell, making the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant. This effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese. Stigma in society against fat people can be a barrier to them changing their lifestyle, making weight problems worse.", "article": "Looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant, scientists have found. Researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free. The scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese. Does looking at this image of an obese man on a bench conjure up a foul odour? You may have an inbuilt prejudice if it does, according to a new study by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles. Surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher BMI themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating. This suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat. Sit ups help tone your stomach, while squats strengthen your legs and bottom - but love handles are particularly difficult to shift. Now scientists believe they have discovered a way to \u2018melt\u2019 the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it \u2018brown\u2019. While white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general, brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat. To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers at the University of Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway. By experimenting on mice, Professor Alexander Pfeifer from the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University Hospital Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine. Adenosine is known to activate brown fat cells, and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor A2A. If adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells, fat burning is significantly stimulated. The researchers transferred A2A receptors from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice and found they started to burn more fat. Dr Ayako Tomiyama, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said: 'You wouldn\u2019t think that not liking someone\u2019s weight could then be seen in a totally different sensory modality. 'It makes us think how else is weight stigma affecting our lives that we don\u2019t even know about? 'This is the first step in proving that the consequences of weight stigma could be very widespread in ways that we don\u2019t even know.' The researchers conducted two studies by showing participants two sets of images of people who were either overweight or normal weight. As they viewed each image, participants were asked to smell a container of lotion tinted with different food colourings and rate the scent. Each container was actually fragrance free and contained the same lotion. The researchers, whose work is published in the International Journal of Obesity, found that when images of overweight or obese people were displayed on the screen, participants gave worse ratings to the scent samples. Images of average sized or thin people produced ratings deemed as more pleasant. Writing in the journal, the researchers, who are also presenting their results at this week's American Psychosomatic Society, said: 'The results showed that the substances were perceived to smell worse when they were paired with images of heavy individuals than when they were paired with images of thin individuals. The researchers say that subconscious disgust at obesity may be manifesting itself in people's sense of smell. 'The effect was most strongly manifested by participants with higher BMIs' The researchers claim the results could be a subconscious signal of disgust. Previous research has shown that there is a connection between feelings of disgust and the perception of foul odours. It could also be associated with widespread assumptions that people who are overweight have problems with body odour. Stigma in society against fat people can be  a barrier to them changing their lifestyle, according to scientists. Angela Incollingo Rodriguez said that while some people are overtly biased against people who are overweight, others may not be aware that they harbour negative feelings. She said that bias within society may actually be making weight problems for those who are obese worse. In the UK around 62 per cent of \u00a0adults are now considered to be overweight or obese while in the US 35 per cent of adults are clinically obese. A previous study by the same team in 2014 showed that girls who were called 'fat' by the age of 10 had a higher chance of being over weight by the time they turned 19 years old. Miss Rodriguez said: 'It undermines people\u2019s motivation to diet and exercise. 'If anything, stigma is a barrier to these lifestyle changes that people commonly use to lose weight. 'By being aware of our deep-seated attitudes regarding weight, we can begin to change our behavior.'"}

Williams has been charged with multiple counts of assault and armed criminal activity, and is being held on a $300,000 cash-only bond. The shots were fired from a hill overlooking the city's police station, and authorities are still trying to determine Williams' intent.", "article": "(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them. Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday. Williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said. He described Williams as a frequent protester in the city -- which some took issue with. Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, said he spoke to Williams on Sunday. \"I asked him why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community,\" Robinson said. \"It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he'd never protested.\" For more than 200 days, protests have taken place in Ferguson since the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted. At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property. The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a.40-caliber handgun, \"which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered\" at the scene of the shooting. Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers. Investigators are not sure they \"buy\" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out. \"It's possible he was firing at someone else,\" he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward. The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time. Officers saw \"muzzle flashes... about 125 yards away,\" Belmar said. \"We could have buried two police officers,\" Belmar told reporters last week. \"I feel very confident that whoever did this... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was.\" Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said. Authorities offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website. McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward. Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, and that the shots came from a grassy hill away from the crowd. \"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people... who have been protesting,\" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said. \"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,\" he said. The department has been criticized since the shooting death of Brown and, more recently, since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday. \"We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting. However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts,\" the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday. While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both men have been treated and released.

Detective Inspector Paul Franklin, of Wiltshire Police, said the suspect approached the twins, who were part of a group which had gathered at a roundabout in the village following a party, before threatening them. Some members of the group then chased the attacker, who police believe was unknown to the teenagers. Mr Franklin said: 'We've been\u00a0told that an unknown man approached the group on the roundabout and threatened them. 'He was chased by several of the teenagers but produced a knife. 'One of the brothers was slashed across the chest and is lucky to be alive because the knife wound was so deep it was close to his heart. He was just a couple of millimetres from death. 'The other brother received cuts to his hands and was treated in hospital in Trowbridge and discharged. 'This was an extremely serious assault with a very sharp blade.'

Throughout history, childbirth has been surrounded by superstition and folklore, and midwives used herbal remedies and birthing chairs to aid in delivery.", "article": "The exact details of the birth of the new royal baby next month will be forever shrouded in mystery. However, one thing is certain, unlike many other queens-in-waiting, the Duchess of Cambridge will have a fleet of medical staff and a range of drug options available to her to ensure the arrival of the new prince or princess is as pain-free as possible. By contrast, when Queen Elizabeth I was born in 1533, giving birth was considered such a dangerous practice, women were encouraged to write their wills. The evolution of childbirth: By the 1940s, men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the NHS in 1948, meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital. This vintage illustration  shows a proud father meeting his newborn twins circa 1952. Retro advertising from the 1950s also shows how attitudes towards pre and post natal care have changed over the years. Men were banished from the delivery room, as were doctors, and midwives - who had learned their trade from their own mothers - were the experts, rubbing ointment on the swollen bellies of their patients to speed up delivery and sprinkling herbs over the floor  to make it smell nice and help the mothers relax. Scottish historian Ashley Cowie, who has appeared on NBC's  Legend Quest, said women were often afraid of giving birth as they feared they would die. He said: 'In the 15th century it was not unusual for girls to be married between the ages of 15 and 19 and the average number of children born to one mother was between five and seven. 'Childbirth was a dangerous time in a woman's life, and most wrote wills when they knew they were pregnant. 'An ancient method of birth control was to extend breastfeeding, which is nature's way of spacing out children.' He added that upper class mothers hired women to feed their babies. 'The hand that rocked the cradle was closer to the truth than you would imagine and among the upper classes it was common to have wet nurses breastfeed so that the mother would soon be pregnant again. A sketch of a woman sitting in a birthing chair in the mid 1500s which were thought to aid nature. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on their wedding day. The couple went on to have nine children, two of them born with the assistance of chloroform. Meanwhile, having babies in the Middle Ages was shrouded in superstition and folklore. He said: 'Several rituals surrounded medieval childbirth, including the burning of the newborn's umbilical cord. Fire was seen as a way of purifying the sinful origins of conception.' Mothers and midwives also used special birthing chairs, which women believed put them in the best position possible to deliver their baby. Leah Astbury, who is studying for a doctorate at Cambridge University and researching maternal and infant health in 17th century England, said: 'Women gave birth at home, assisted by a midwife and a group of female friends, neighbours and family members, called gossips. When her labour began, it was often her husband\u2019s job to fetch them. During the 16th century, even queens (Henry VIII's wives Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr) weren't immune from the lack of understanding about cleanliness, and both died of puerperal fever, a septic infection of the reproductive organs that always resulted in death. 'At the birth, herbal remedies and a drink called caudle, a kind of fortifying alcoholic porridge or eggnog, were commonly drunk to keep her strong during the birth, and possibly dull the pain. 'Seventeenth century women often expressed a complex relationship with the pain of labour. On the one hand, childbirth had the potential to be redemptive. It was part of Eve\u2019s penance. 'In reality, however, families were obviously relieved when women gave birth relatively easily and recovered quickly.' This treated disk was said to determine the sex of an unborn child after it was placed on the tongue. Babies in a maternity unit in the 1950s and 1960s were kept in one room to enable their mothers to rest. Three pregnant women relax in medical'space-suits' in 1965 in an attempt to ease childbirth and raise the intelligence of their offspring. A suction pump next to the chairs lowers pressure inside the suits, while a gauge in front of them gives a constant reading. In 1672, physician Percival Willughby wrote Observations in Midwifery, a book about contemporary labour practices. He wrote: 'Let all midwives bee assured, that it is not their labours, in pulling, and haling their women\u2019s bodies, that causeth deliver. But that it is the work of Dame nature.' Remarking on one case, he wrote: 'Her mother-in-law was a midwife, and had used her very harshly; through her unhandsome doings, her body was much bruised, and, by her pulling the infant by the arme, shee had destroyed"}

The only problem was that Giggs wasn't buying it. Giggs has been at United for two decades and didn't even crack a smile. He knows that football like this will not take his football club where it needs to go. Not in the long run, anyway. Giggs has seen plenty of late winning goals for United over the years. He has been part of teams that have won when they haven't deserved to, who have somehow grabbed something from games that seemingly had nothing to offer.

Young runs over to celebrate in front of the Manchester United fans after his late strike at St James' Park. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Danny Blind are among the United players to celebrate with Young.

This United team, on the other hand, the one with Van Gaal's uncertain hand on the tiller, stumbles its way in to opportunities. Somehow it manages to win despite itself. If it continues like this for another two months then it may yet find itself in the Champions League places come the season's end. At the moment, though, it is hard to see it. This, in many ways, was the modern United at their worst. Facing a home team devoid of purpose, energy and intelligence, United really should have taken hold of this game, won it comfortably and used it as a platform ahead of tougher challenges to come. Instead, they saw Newcastle miss two golden opportunities and wasted their own with inept work in front of goal.

Germany is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims Greece will exit from the euro. Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he is resigned to the possibility of a Greek exit from the calamitous euro experiment. In a TV interview on Thursday evening he was asked if he could envisage it and he replied: 'Yes, because the responsibility, the ability to decide what happens, resides with the Greeks, and because we do not know what the leaders intend to do in Greece, we cannot exclude it.' Chancellor Angela Merkel has also run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in Athens, reports suggested. Their comments represent a tectonic shift from the previous undiluted support Germany offered Greece - a country whose financial mismanagement is loathed by EU lawmakers. And in recent days tensions between Berlin and Athens have spiked even further. The new Tsipras government first threatened to seize German businesses and assets if Germany did not provide billions of pounds of compensation for damages caused during the Nazi occupation during World War II. Greece also made a threat to send refugees - terrorist suspects among them - from its shores to Germany if Berlin did not support it in ongoing debt crisis talks. 'If they deal a blow to Greece, then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to Berlin,' Panos Kammenos told a meeting of his right-wing party Independent Greeks. He also said that if some of the refugees were members of the terrorist group Isis, it would be Europe's fault because of its position on Greece's economic problems. On Thursday the Greek ambassador in Berlin made an official complaint to the foreign ministry about the behaviour of Sch\u00e4uble towards his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis. The Ambassador claimed that Sch\u00e4uble had called Varoufakis na\u00efve, a charge he denies. Sch\u00e4uble said Greece can only get more funds if it sticks to the agreements with its creditors. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (left) threatened to seize German businesses and assets if Germany did not provide billions of pounds of compensation.\u00a0Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) is said to have run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in Athens. He said: 'Europe stands ready to help Greece, but Greece must be prepared to help itself. The problem will not be solved by turning others into scapegoats.' His comments were made as a new poll showed 52 per cent of Germans would be happy for Greece to quit the common currency while 80 per cent believe that Greece is not acting seriously in trying to adhere to its obligations on debt repayments and financial reforms. A Greek exit would plunge Germany's financial institutions into crisis and the impact on other countries - including the UK - could be severe. There would almost certainly be a 'flight to safety' as depositors pull euros out of other potentially vulnerable eurozone members such as Portugal, Spain and Italy to avoid taking a hit. European company share prices would also fall sharply. Experts say Britain would be hit extremely hard. Almost half of British trade is with Europe and a continental slump would translate into lost orders and jobs while the financial chaos would also hit the City."}

It was followed by a 5.7-magnitude aftershock and a 1.5-foot-high tsunami, which was measured in Rabaul's harbor, near the quake's epicenter, said Martin Mose, from the National Disaster Center. But despite the quake - which was likely  felt by people up to a staggering 2,000\u00a0kilometers\u00a0(1,240 miles)\u00a0away - and the subsequent tsunami, no damage nor injuries have been reported, officials said. Quake: This photo, released by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shows a shakemap of the region (white cross) in Papua New Guinea where a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Monday. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had warned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 10 feet in parts of Papua New Guinea, and waves of less than one foot in other Pacific countries. It said 'hazardous tsunami waves were possible for coasts located within 1,000 km of the earthquake epicentre along the coasts of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands'. But the center lifted the warning a few hours later, after reporting a one-inch tsunami wave was measured at a wharf in the Solomon Islands, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the epicenter.

In Rabaul, residents noticed the sea level rose slightly, prompting ocean water to flood the parking lot of a shopping center near the beach, said Mika Tuvi, an employee at the Rabaul Hotel. 'But nothing beyond that - no damage caused,' she said. When the quake struck, guests and workers at the hotel fled outside, fearing the building would collapse, Ms Tuvi said. The tremors, which lasted for about 5 minutes, were frightening in their intensity, but the hotel withstood the shaking, she said. Location: The quake hit about 10am local time Monday and a tsunami warning has been issued in the region. No threat: On Monday, Geoscience Australia said there was no immediate threat to Australia. Officials in the capital, Port Moresby, were working to contact their counterparts in the outer provinces, but hours after the quake, there still had been no reports of damage or injuries. Mr Mose said he was confident the nation had averted a major catastrophe. The quake caused strong shaking and knocked items off shelves in Kokopo, and was felt 500 miles away in Port Moresby, said Chris McKee, assistant director of the Geophysical Observatory.

Amish Kansagra opened a massage parlour with his Polish lover Anna Imporowicz, but he was angry that she attracted interest from other men, including her ex-boyfriend. The couple fell out when a man smiled at Miss Imporowicz in a salsa club - and the next day Kansagra turned up at her home and stabbed her in the throat, saying: 'You will die today.' He was today convicted of attempted murder at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court, after a jury heard he had 'eyes like the devil' during his violent rampage. Attack: Amish Kansagra, left, tried to murder his masseuse girlfriend Anna Imporowicz, right. Judge Susan Tapping said that Kansagra, 28, would face a 'lengthy sentence' for the crime after being found guilty. The couple first started dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Miss Imporowicz, 35, who would give massages to naked customers while she was topless or wearing skimpy underwear. He left his job at a bank and opened a massage parlour with her in Ealing, west London, but their relationship fell apart last June after the incident in a Holborn salsa club. The court heard that the pair went home together that night, but Kansagra shoved Miss Imporowicz against a fridge, destroyed her phone and laptop and posted a picture of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.' The next day, he turned up at her house in nearby Brentford armed with a knife which he had taken from the massage parlour. Victim: Miss Imporowicz met the defendant because he was a massage customer of hers. Prosecutor Julian Jones told the jury: 'She saw Amish with the knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said, \"You've made the wrong decision. You will die today.\" 'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying, \"I love you. Don't do this.\" 'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes like the devil, and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.' Miss Imporowicz tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant, Mr Jones continued. 'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side. 'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.' A retired nurse came to her aid, and as Kansagra fled the scene he told witnesses that Miss Imporowicz had inflicted the horrific injuries on himself. The defendant initially ran away to Manchester, but he later turned himself in to police and claimed not to remember anything thanks to a three-day vodka binge. 'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him,' the prosecutor said. 'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.' Kansagra was convicted by the jury of one count of attempted murder, but was found not guilty of assaulting Miss Imporowicz. Before the trial he pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Kansagra was remanded in custody for sentencing on March 19."}

After the elections, Jonathan urged Nigerians to stay away from violence and follow due process.", "article": "(CNN)Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says. Jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to his countrymen. \"I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,\" he said. The Independent National Electoral Commission is still announcing the final tally in the polls, but early numbers indicate Buhari, now the President-elect, has an overwhelming majority of votes. Buhari ruled Nigeria from late 1983 until August 1985 after ousting his predecessor in a coup. His 20-month rule was known for what he described as a \"war on indiscipline,\" a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses. The 72-year-old  retired major general's experience as a military ruler has variably been viewed as a plus or minus in present-day Nigeria, where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group Boko Haram. His campaign has focused on security and ending corruption in Nigeria. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? Violent protests after elections Saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the United States and Britain against political interference. Demonstrators fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state on Sunday as they marched to protest the elections amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. After the protests in Rivers, Buhari's All Progressives Congress demanded the elections there be canceled. \"There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,\" party spokesman Lai Mohammed said. But the People's Democratic Party disputed the accusation, saying the election was \"credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan.\" Both candidates took to social media to call for calm. \"I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,\" Jonathan said on his Facebook account. \"Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,\" Buhari said on Twitter. Jonathan and  Buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to \"free, fair and credible elections\" after their signing of  the Abuja Accord in January. In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan said; \"I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word.\" He advised anyone upset with the results to follow due process and stay away from further violence. \"As I have always affirmed, nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. The unity, stability and progress of our dear country is more important than anything else,\" he said. Read more: Democracy was the real winner. More than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across Nigeria's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate. Nigeria's vote had been scheduled for February 14, but on February 7, Nigeria's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns, with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. The controversial decision was unpopular among many Nigerians and led to widespread protests. Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists.

Captain Vincent Kompany admitted that City are still a long way behind the very best in Europe. The defeat is another blow to City's morale as they now face a battle to hold onto second place in the Premier League.", "article": "Manchester City got straight back to business after their disappointing Champions League exit as the squad remained in Barcelona overnight and held a session at Espanyol's training ground on Thursday. Manuel Pellegrini's side were dumped out by Barcelona after a 1-0 defeat at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night but were put through their paces ahead of a return to Premier League action. The champions host West Bromwich Albion at the Etihad on Saturday lunchtime as they bid to get their title challenge back on track after a shock defeat by Burnley last weekend. Manchester City players trained in Spain on Thursday following their Champions League exit the night before. The City squad are put through their exercises at Espanyol's training ground in Barcelona. The players were given no time to mull over their European exit after they were taught a lesson over two legs to find themselves on the wrong end a 3-1 aggregate result. After such a commanding performance by the La Liga leaders captain Vincent Kompany was forced to admit that Manchester City are still a long way behind the very best in Europe. 'The reality is they were a better team, there is no shame in admitting that. For me there is a big, big difference. 'I will just mention Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and then there are the rest of the teams, with Real Madrid probably in between. 'Ultimately we have always said our goal is to become as good as them, but it will take some time. They are really good. Goalkeeper Joe Hart and captain Vincent Kompany train ahead of their Premier League return on Saturday. Samir Nasri shares a joke as Manuel Pellegrini's side prepare to face West Brom at the Etihad on Saturday. 'Bayern Munich and Barcelona are not just Champions League-winning teams, they are World Cup-winning teams as well. They have generations that have played together a long time. 'Of course we want to make up the gap but you just have to be true to yourself. We have the ambition to be as good as they are one day, but it is not going to happen overnight.' City's exit meant that England will not have a representative in the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons. 'The gap will eventually get closer,' said Kompany. 'Whether it is Arsenal, Chelsea, (Manchester) United, the gap will become closer and I just hope it is us that gets there the first.' Kompany and Hart, who produced a fine goalkeeping display against Barca, take a break from training. City were outplayed in the first leg at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago but had hoped Hart's late penalty save, which kept the score 2-1, might have proved the tie's turning point. It proved anything but as Barca dominated from the outset, hitting the post within moments through Neymar. Messi was at his inspirational best, setting up Ivan Rakitic's 31st-minute goal and generally running City ragged. It was remarkable the scoreline stayed at 1-0, with Luis Suarez also hitting the woodwork twice and England goalkeeper Hart producing a series of stunning saves in one of the best performances of his career. City might have made the latter stages interesting had Sergio Aguero not had a penalty saved by Marc-Andre ter Stegen but they could complain little about the result. Ivan Rakitic beat Joe Hart with a brilliant lob over the City keeper to give Barcelona a 1-0 win at the Nou Camp. The Croatia midfielder celebrates with his team-mates after opening the scoring the hosts. Asked about Hart's display, centre-back Kompany said: 'It was phenomenal. On that side of the pitch I felt we had all the luck we needed to get a result. 'It was probably just the penalty - if we had scored a goal it could have been a different game. It would have been a great way to get back into the tie and it would have been interesting to see what the last 15 minutes would have been like back at 1-1. 'If you want to win against those teams you need a very special performance and a little bit of luck on your side. Then you can beat them, but every team can lose. There is no shame.' Despite progress always seeming unlikely, the defeat is another blow to City's morale after an indifferent spell in the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO Pellegrini disappointed after Champions League exit. Manchester City's players leave the Nou Camp looking glum after being eliminated. Messi tries to take the ball around the onrushing Manchester City goalkeeper Hart. Having fallen six points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand, it now seems unlikely City can retain their title and their season is in danger of fizzling out. They could even face a battle to hold onto second place as the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United gear up for a strong finish. Kompany is determined to ensure that does not happen. The 28-year-old said: 'Forget about Chelsea. We owe it to"}

Bradley Wright-Phillips is the star man for the New York Red Bulls, having won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games.", "article": "Orlando\u2019s streets have been paved in purple, and gold, as the city embraces football and its newest sports team. Orlando City face Frank Lampard\u2019s future club New York City in a battle of the MLS debutants on Sunday evening in Florida\u2019s Citrus Bowl stadium. But the night before, the city was gripped with football fever as the club created their own festival downtown. Everything was awash with the purple and gold-trimmed Orland kit. Former Everton midfielder Adrian Heath has guided Orlando City to the MLS after four years of hard work. Sunday's match will take place at Florida's Citrus Bowl, which was a venue at the 1994 USA World Cup. A city has warmly welcomed its newest arrival, coming out in their hoards and spending their hard-earned dollars to don the gear and get behind the team. There was even a band brought in to play live to the thronging masses where a whole street was closed off. At one stage, as an item of clothing was thrown amongst the crowd it caught in a light fixing above. 'That's for the soccer Gods,' the lead singer roared and the audience duly erupted in delight (perhaps not the person who lost their jacket). In a country where American Football, basketball and ice hockey already vie for the nations' attention, he could even be forgiven for calling it'soccer.' But they might have to start finding a new name for their beloved NFL if football keeps growing over here at this rate. New York City have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase. David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City. Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City. Orlando\u2019s main other sports team, basketball\u2019s Orlando Magic, are struggling and in these parts a new rival has waltzed in. The entire city was painted purple leading up to the match; signs, posters and banners everywhere. Americans certainly know how to celebrate a sporting occasion. The pre-match partying went well into the early hours, but they did not let sore heads stand in the way of preparing for the game. The fans were out in force again in the hours leading up to kick-off, the smell of barbecues strong in air around the stadium as they set up marquees and settled in for the long haul. Frank Lampard will join the MLS revolution at New York City in the summer when his loan at Man City ends. Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' Lampard and Steven Gerrard are soon to join the league, this summer, but even before then they already have Kaka, once considered the greatest player on the planet, at Orlando City and David Villa at New York City, amongst a growing list of prominent names. Hopefully Saturday night\u2019s celebrations did not keep up the New York City squad staying in a nearby hotel, where just that morning Claudio Reyna, their director of football operations, had sat having a contrastingly quiet and relaxed breakfast with his family. There is a sell-out 63,000-strong stadium to entertain. Kaka - Orlando City SC. The Brazilian won the Ballon d\u2019Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard \u2013 New York City FC. One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard \u2013 LA Galaxy. The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC. Villa became New York City\u2019s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York\u2019s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls. Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term."}

The man says he gave his former partner, with whom he already had a child, the drugs after he found out she was pregnant after they had a one-night stand at a mutual friend's party. The man told Trondheim court, pictured, that he felt like a sh*tbag after giving his ex-girlfriend the smoothie laced with the drugs.

Capturing the whole occasion on camera, the drone\u2019s operator is featured at the start of the video setting up the device and giving an approving thumbs up. As the drone flies off into the air, the video rewinds to the couple\u2019s incoming flight from Minneapolis\u2019 Saint Paul International Airport. Time lapse footage captures the mountains through the clouds from the aeroplane\u2019s window before the flight lands in Jackson Hole Airport. Upon disembarking the plane, the man, Rich Costello, secretly films his soon-to-be fiancee before another time lapse shot appears to capture the couple's apartment. After a few more artistic shots of ski lifts and snowboarders relaxing on a mountain, the footage returns to the moving drone. The drone's operator sets up the device and gives the camera the thumbs up as it takes off from the ground. Rich\u00a0Costello tells his girlfriend he needs more pictures of her and instructs her to perform a yoga pose at the top of the mountain. Focussing on the couple, who stand on a raised part of the mountain, the drone hovers as the man gets down on one knee and presents a ring. The camera then switches to that of the man\u2019s POV and the woman can be seen gasping and laughing in surprise of the gesture before confirming her answer with a hug. According to Mr Costello, his fiancee shares his passion for snowboarding and the couple plan a trip to the snowy location every year. Interrupting her yoga stance, Mr Costello greets his girlfriend and begins talking to her on the mountain.

Hutchinson has said he'll sign the measure, even though he's facing protests from activists who say it could open the door to discrimination against. gays and lesbians. Like Indiana's new law, the Arkansas measure aims to keep the state government from forcing. business owners to act against their religious beliefs, but. critics say it will be a 'license to discriminate' by refusing service to. gays and lesbians. Concerns about wedding vendors who have religious objections to playing a part in same-sex ceremonies have driven most of the controversy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. HOOSIER 2.0: Arkansas will take the religious-liberty-firestorm baton from Indiana as soon as Gov. Asa Hutchinson signs his state's new law. Gov. Hutchinson, a former U.S. congressman who earned his college degree from the evangelical Bob Jones University, says he'll sign the bill. 'This legislation doesn't allow anybody to discriminate against anybody, not here,' Republican state Rep. Bob Ballinger told The Washington Post on Tuesday.\u00a0'The bill does just the opposite.' SURRENDER: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence walked back his state's new religious freedom law on Tuesday, saying he would work with lawmakers to 'fix' it. Ballinger, an attorney in private practice, sponsored the bill. He said the legislation 'focuses on the civil rights of people believing what they want to believe, and not letting the government interfere with that.' But he said he agrees with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who has been fighting a tide of resentment after he signed a similar bill into law, that 'there needs to be some clarity in the perception of the legislation.' 'As it sits right now,' he told the Post, his bill is 'not going to enable a person to discriminate.' Final approval came when the Arkansas House overwhelmingly. concurred with three amendments added by the Senate, which. approved the bill last week. Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola has asked Hutchinson to veto. the bill, saying in a letter on Tuesday the legislation is. unnecessary and could hurt the state's economy. 'Any piece of legislation that is so divisive cannotpossibly be good for the state of Arkansas and its people. Withthese kind of \"wedge\" issues,' no one is a winner on either side,' he said. Supporters said the law does not allow for discrimination. and is needed to protect religious freedoms. The Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce said it is 'bad. for business and bad for Arkansas.' Democrats said it will allow. for bigotry. 'Our history will tell us that when religion is used as a. sword it is often used to attack people of color and women,' said Representative Eddie Armstrong, an African-American and. Democratic floor leader. Arkansas-based retail giant Wal-Mart Stores said the bill sends the 'wrong message' about its home state. The outcry over the Indiana law was so fierce that the. state's governor, Republican Mike Pence, on Tuesday said he. would 'fix' the legislation to make it clear businesses. cannot use it to discriminate against same-sex couples. Earlier in March, a Senate-approved religious freedom bill in Georgia was put. on hold after a House member added anti-discrimination language. On Monday, North Carolina's governor said he would not sign similar language into law because it would allow government. officials to refuse to perform marriages on religious grounds. If enacted, the Arkansas proposal would prohibit state and local governments from infringing on a person's religious beliefs without a 'compelling' reason. But unlike in Indiana, Arkansas lawmakers said they will not modify their measure. SPONSOR: Arkansas GOP state Rep. Bob Ballinger watched the votes come in to support an amended versio nof his religious freedom bill in the state legislature on Tuesday; he says the measure isn't discriminatory. VETO! Hundreds of protesters yelled their demand that the governor turn away the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but Christians in the state House and Senate prevailed and the governor will enact the law. Over the past two days, hundreds of protesters filled Arkansas' Capitol to oppose the measure, holding signs that read 'Discrimination is not a Christian Value' and 'Discrimination is a Disease,' and chanting 'Shame on You' at Ballinger. Sexual orientation and gender identity are not included in Arkansas' anti-discrimination protections. Last month, Hutchinson allowed a measure to go into law that prevented local governments from including such protections in their anti-discrimination ordinances. This time he intends to affix his signature and make it the law of the Razorback State. 'I have said if this bill reaches my desk in similar form as to what has been passed in 20 other states then I will sign it,' the governor said Monday. 'But I am pleased that the legislature is continuing to look at ways to assure balance and fairness in the legislation.'"}
{"abstract": "New research has found that many parents are unable to recognize when their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese, leading to a gap between parental perceptions of child weight status and obesity scales used by medical professionals. This gap could prevent parents from understanding the health risks associated with overweight and increase uptake of healthier lifestyles. The study suggests that measures should be taken to help parents better understand the health risks associated with overweight and obesity.", "article": "Many parents are afflicted by 'weight-blindness', unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese, new research has found. The research discovered that just under a third (31 per cent) of the parents underestimated where their child's body mass index (BMI) was on obesity scale. The scale  classifies children as very overweight (or obese), overweight, a healthy weight, or underweight. Many parents are afflicted by 'weight blindness', and are unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese, according to new research (file picture) Just four parents described their child as being very overweight despite 369 children being officially identified as such (1 per cent) and fewer than 1 per cent overestimated their child's weight status. According to official guidelines, children are classified as overweight at the 85th centile and very overweight (or obese) at the 95th centile. The team estimated that for a child with a BMI at the 98th centile there was an 80 per cent chance that the parent would classify their child as a healthy weight. Tam Fry, spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum and chair of the Child Growth Forum said: \u2018Because there are so many overweight and obese children around, the parents are in denial. 'They say \u201cmy Jonny is no fatter than the child down the road\u201d. 'My advice would be that if any parent is concerned about their child\u2019s weight, they should take the child to the doctor or chemist. \u2018Think of an excuse to go down. Have the doctor or chemist take the BMI. 'When they have the result they can reassure the parent, or give them advice on whether the child\u2019s weight is too high. \u2018BMI is a very good measure, but it needs input from a health professional who can look at the child holistically and judge whether there is a problem or not. \u2018Parents will not be able to measure their child accurately as they won't have the correct measurements for height and for weight bathroom scales are notoriously inaccurate. \u2018They need to be properly measured by a professional who can make a proper judgement and give proper advice. \u2018You cannot tell if a child is overweight or obese on one measure. 'You need to look at the child\u2019s BMI and ideally plot this against their BMI three months ago.' However, they recognised that parents became more likely to classify their child as overweight when the child had a BMI above the 99.7th centile. The study found that parents were more likely to underestimate their child's weight if they were black or south Asian, from more deprived backgrounds, or if the child was male. Researchers suggested that if parents cannot identify when their child is overweight, this throws into question the effectiveness of public health campaigns aiming to address obesity in the home. Recent research found that a third of children in England are now classed as overweight or obese. Parents might underestimate their children's weight due to be fear of being judged, unwillingness to label a child as overweight, and shifting perceptions of normal weight because of increases in body weight in general. They said evidence suggests that parents who recognise their child's weight on the BMI chart are more likely to perceive potential health risks. The study was led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and UCL Institute of Child Health. It involved questioning the parents of 2,976 children in five primary care trusts: Redbridge, Islington, West Essex, Bath and North East Somerset, and Sandwell. The team said the research could help evaluate how effective public health interventions for obesity in children are likely to be in different groups of the population. Senior author Dr Sanjay Kinra, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'If parents are unable to accurately classify their own child's weight, they may not be willing or motivated to enact the changes to the child's environment that promote healthy weight maintenance.' Co-author Professor Russell Viner, of the UCL institute of Child Health, said: 'Measures that decrease the gap between parental perceptions of child weight status and obesity scales used by medical professionals may now be needed in order to help parents better understand the health risks associated with overweight and increase uptake of healthier lifestyles.' Graph, from the US' Centres for Disease Control and Prevention,\u00a0shows how an a 10 year old boy would be considered healthy, underweight, healthy, overweight or obese depending on which percentile they are in on the BMI chart. A 10 year old with a BMI of 23 would be in the obese category (95th percentile or greater) The study was published in the British Journal of General Practice. Amanda McLean, director of the World Cancer Research Fund, said: \u2018By encouraging children to eat healthily, maintain a healthy weight, and be regularly physically active, parents can help children develop healthy habits and protect against health problems later in life. \u2018We know that obesity is linked to a range of health risks later in life \u2013 including increased cancer risk \u2013 so it"}

Tracey Desmond, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wanted to surprise her husband Jason when he returned from a tour of the Falkland Islands this month. The 35-year-old dropped three stone in just two months - going from a size 22 to a svelte size 12/14 and kept her impressive 38lb weight loss a secret from her partner of four years. Tracey Desmond, 35, surprised her husband of four years, Jason, by shedding almost three stone in two months while he was away on tour. Husband Jason compared his wife's look to TV character Ugly Betty (right) before her weight loss (left) Tracey said she was determined to beat the bulge before Jason - a Corporal in the Royal Logistics Corp - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis. She said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure Jason couldn't see her when the pair would video chat while Jay was serving abroad with the army. She said: 'I decided after Christmas that I needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous. The weight just seemed to creep up on me and I couldn't believe that I was a size 20. 'I wanted to keep the whole surprise factor and do a big reveal so I would make sure Jay couldn't see me when we Skyped. 'I was just googling weight loss and Easy Loss came up - I had heard of people doing hypnosis to stop smoking so I thought I would give it a go. 'I started at the beginning of January and the weight just seemed to drop off - I've lost 38 pounds in just two months. 'I even went out and bought a new dress, in a size 12, and got dressed up for the occasion. 'And when Jay walked through the door and saw me there was this look of shock on his face.' Jason, 42, said: 'It was a massive shock - I felt like I had left behind Ugly Betty and came home to Cinderella. Before the weight loss: Tracey had started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort-ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy. 'Nothing Tracey has tried before has ever really worked so I was shocked that this worked so well. And it was lovely to see her in a dress for a change. 'I have had to learn to feed myself too as she only eats when she's hungry - so it has probably done me some good too. 'When I get back from tour I have promised her I am going to take her shopping and treat her to some new clothes for our holiday.' The HR and Training Coordinator can now fit her whole body in one leg of her former size 22 trousers. Tracey started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy. But the determined HR and Training Coordinator has now set herself the task of shedding the final two stone by the time Jay's tour comes to an end in 10 weeks time. And she is spurred on by a luxury holiday the pair have booked to the Dominican Republic - with her final goal being to flaunt her new bikini body in a size 12 tankini. The ultimate goal is for Tracey to wear a size 12 tankini on the beach on holiday in the Dominican Republic. Tracey said: 'We always book a holiday for when Jason is off so that we have something to look forward to. 'My goal now is to be able to wear a tankini on the beach - that's what I am pushing towards. And I don't want all the women looking at him while we are away. 'I feel such a huge difference in myself since I started Easy Loss and it is just so easy. It's not a diet and I can still eat whatever I want, whenever I want - but I just eat when I'm hungry. 'It's a way of life and I can't ever see myself going back to how I was before now. I have learned how to listen to my body, and only eat when I am hungry.' Tracey's incredible weight loss story received 900 likes on the hypnosis app's Facebook support group. Sue Peckham, co-founder of the Easy Loss Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast App, said: 'Tracey is an absolute inspiration. She has been brilliant and followed the instructions of the app to the letter. She has really done so well. 'And it is such a lovely story that she did it to surprise her husband, it brought a tear to my eye when I spoke to them and he said that he was so shocked when he came home and saw her. They are such a sweet couple. 'Her story got an incredible 900 likes from our Easyloss Facebook Support Group members-one of the"}

Her mother, Lynn Groesbeck, was found dead in the wreckage, and Lily's father, Deven Trafny, is mourning her loss while rejoicing in his daughter's survival. Police are investigating the cause of the crash, and have found a bag of marijuana, a bottle of pills, and an opened syringe in the car.", "article": "The father of an 18-month-old girl who was rescued from a wrecked car 14 hours after it plunged into a frigid Utah river has revealed her incredible progress in a video taken from hospital. Lily Groesbeck was released from Primary Children's Hospital on Wednesday, four days after her mother's wrecked car was spotted overturned and partially submerged in a river in Spanish Fork. Lily's mother, 25-year-old Lynn Groesbeck, was killed in the crash but emergency responders found that the little girl was miraculously alive. 'I'm blessed,' Lily's father, 34-year-old Deven Trafny, told KUTV. I'm counting all my blessings right now...\u00a0She should be gone. She shouldn't be here right now. I'm overwhelmed with joy right now.' Scroll down for video. Safe: Dad Deven Trafny smiles as he looks at his daughter,\u00a0Lily Groesbeck, in a video taken in hospital and released by the family. Lily has now left the hospital after surviving for 14 hours in a car wreck. On the mend: Trafny is seen playing with his daughter, who is back to her normal self, he has said. He also shared a video of Lily waving shyly at the camera in hospital as he holds her in his arms. He said the toddler has been watching cartoons and laughing with her family members, and remembers everything she knew before the crash. While caring for little Lily, Trafny is trying to comprehend losing the 'love of my life', his fianc\u00e9e Lynn. 'That's kind of a hard situation for me right now,' he said. 'I haven't really wrapped my head around that. She was the love of my life and I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that.' A fisherman spotted the car on Saturday, the day after it hit a cement barrier on a bridge and careened into the river in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. According to the Deseret News, the angler called a non-emergency line and said: 'Are you guys aware there's a car in the river on the south end of Spanish Fork, Main Street, over the bridge? I didn't see anybody when I came in here and I can't see in the car.' Emotional: He said he is overjoyed and shocked that Lily survived the crash but that he is mourning 'the love of my life' - Lily's mother, Lynn Groesbeck, who was found dead in the wreckage. Then four minutes later, the same caller dialed 911 directly and said: 'There's a car in the river. It's upside down off of Main Street and there is a person inside. I can see a hand.' Rescuers found the unconscious baby girl strapped into her car seat, where she had been hanging upside down for 14 hours as icy water flowed through the car. In a bizarre twist, emergency responders said they had heard desperate pleas from the mother inside the car, even though she had likely been killed on impact. They reported hearing cries of: 'Help me! Help me!' Rescuers have said they are trying to figure out how they had heard the mother's voice. Family: The couple pose for a picture with their baby daughter, who has now left the hospital with just bruises. Mystery: Emergency responders said they arrived on the scene and heard Lynn calling out for help - but later realized she had died on impact. They said they are trying to fathom how they heard her voice. Officer Tyler Beddoes said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. It was extra motivation.' Beddoes said he and officers formed a line in the river and handed the cold girl to one another until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms. They rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR. It is still unclear how she managed to survive with no food or water, but a doctor told\u00a0CNN that when someone suffers from\u00a0hypothermia, their metabolism slows and their oxygen intake reduces, becoming 'neuro-protective'. Jill Sanderson, Lynn's sister, said her sister was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life. When Lily was retreived from the car, police officers handed the cold girl to one another until she reached the shore and emergency workers could rush her to the hospital. Police were investigating what caused the crash but say Lynn Groesbeck could have been distracted or drowsy. Spanish Fork police Lieutenant Matt Johnson told\u00a0KUTV that investigators found a bag of what looks marijuana in the car, along with a bottle of 16 pills they think are pain medications and an opened syringe. He said they won't know if drugs contributed to the crash until toxicology reports came back in several weeks."}
{"abstract": "Richard White, 63, was shot by Lt Heather Slyve of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's department after he charged at Carol Richel with a machete at a security checkpoint in New Orleans airport. White was carrying a bag of six Molotov cocktails and was shot in the chest, thigh and face. He died in hospital Saturday afternoon, and Richel hailed Lt Slyve as her 'hero' for saving her life.", "article": "Slasher: Richard White, 63, died in hospital Saturday afternoon, the night after he was gunned down while trying to hack a TSA worker to death. The machete-wielding maniac who was gunned down as he tried to hack a TSA worker to death has died in hospital. Richard White, 63, charged at Carol Richel at a security checkpoint inside New Orleans airport Friday evening - but was stopped in his tracks by a female cop. He was carrying a sack of six Molotov cocktails during the attack, but was not able to detonate them. Lt Heather Slyve, of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's department, shot White in the chest, the thigh and the face as he lunged at Richel. He was rushed to hospital Friday evening and went into surgery, but died of his wounds around 4pm Saturday, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Earlier that day Richel had hailed Lt Slyve as her 'hero', saying she would certainly be dead if it weren't for her fatal intervention. Speaking at a press conference, Richel said: 'Officer Slyve is my hero. She saved my life. 'The man was within inches of whacking me with the machete and she did save my life, and saved probably a lot of others.' When he was shot, White was carrying a bag loaded with six Molotov cocktails - Mason jars with cloth wicks soaked in gasoline - Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said. There was also reportedly a barbeque lighter and a letter opener in his bag, while smoke bombs and tanks of acetelyne (an explosive), Freon (an aerosol) and oxygen were discovered in the trunk of White's parked car. Scroll down for video. Saved: TSA employee Carol Richel, above, was inches from being slash by White. She today paid tribute to Lt Heather Slyve, the cop who saved her from the attack at New Orleans's Louis Armstrong International Airport. Dead: White is pictured above last night being wheeled out of the airport. He was in surgery last night but died 4pm Saturday of his wounds. Gunned down: White is pictured above where he fell, not far from the machete. But despite his stash of weapons, he only managed to spray several people with the insecticide, and swing his machete without hitting anybody before he was shot. In the struggle Richel herself was hit by one of Lt Slyve's shots. She later explained that she and her colleagues are trained for such situations, saying: 'It was second nature'. She explained: 'We want to make sure the passengers are safe, so we tell them \"run, run, you've got to get out of here, run\". And with that, we know they're leaving,' according to CNN. However, Richel said that because TSA officials do not carry guns, she was forced to rely on police to save her life, saying: 'They're the ones there with the weapons to be able to protect us.' 'Second nature': During the press conference, Richel (pictured front) said she and her colleagues had been trained how to react in such a situation, saying: 'It was second nature'. She said passenger safety came first. Injured: White was in possession of a bag loaded with six Molotov cocktails when he launched the attack, Sheriff Newell Normand said. Above, Richel is pictured being transported to an ambulance via stretcher. 'Senseless act of violence': This statement was posted on the TSA's Twitter page on Saturday afternoon. After White attacked two security officials and a number of passersby with the wasp spray at the airport's security checkpoint, he drew his machete from the waistband of his pants. He then started swinging the weapon, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggage as White ran through a metal detector, Normand said earlier on Saturday. Seconds later, White began chasing Richel, prompting Lt Slyve to fire three rounds at him, striking him the face, chest and leg. White was then rushed to hospital, where he had surgery. According to authorities, residue from smoke bombs was  found near White's body at the security checkpoint. Hurt: An injured man - possibly a passenger who was hurt while fleeing the scene - is pictured at the airport. On guard: Police clear out the area around Concourse B of Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday evening. Emergency response: Police poured into the airport \u00a0and ushered everybody away from the area where the shooting took place. The sheriff suggested that White has had'mental health' issues. He is a Jehovah's Witness and has refused 'certain types of medical care,' Normand said. His family is cooperating with investigators. 'Fortunately, he didn't seriously injure anybody,' Normand said. Richel, a Supervisory Security Officer for the Transportation Security Administration, was struck in the arm by one of Lt Slyve's rounds while running from White. Her wound was quickly deemed non-life"}
