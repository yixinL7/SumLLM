{"article": "When nurse Faye Gregson decided to share an intimate moment with her boyfriend, privacy wasn\u2019t exactly utmost in her mind. Not only did her romantic liaison take place in the front seat of her Audi, but she was also parked in the middle of a zebra crossing. And to top it all off, she left her hazard lights flashing. Faye Gregson, 26, from Preston, was arrested by police after they found her car parked at an angle on a zebra crossing on Christmas Eve while she was straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat. The 26-year-old, who was nearly twice the drink-drive limit, was arrested after police caught her straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat. Yesterday, she was fined \u00a3300 and begged a judge not to take her licence, saying: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u2019 A court heard she had stopped in the middle of the road in Blackpool at around 2.30am on Christmas Eve before clambering on top of her boyfriend. Gregson, whose favourite books include Fifty Shades of Grey, had parked her black Audi at an angle on the crossing but put her hazard lights on to warn other drivers. The keen netball player at first denied she had been drinking and tried to get out of a breathalyser test by claiming that she had a cold, Blackpool Magistrates Court heard. But officers carried out the test anyway, describing her as \u2018smelling of alcohol\u2019 and having glazed eyes. Prosecutor Alison Quanbrough told the court they had spotted her because of her flashing hazard lights. Gregson initially denied being drunk, saying she had just finished a 15-hour shift at Preston hospital. She refused a breath test, saying she had a cold, but a urine test showed she was twice the drink-drive limit. \u2018She was straddling a male in the passenger seat,\u2019 said Mrs Quanbrough. \u2018When she saw the police she got off the male. She then got into the driver\u2019s seat and put on the seatbelt.\u2019 Officers asked Gregson to step out of the car and found she was unsteady on her feet. But she said she had not been drinking, and claimed to have just finished a 15-hour shift at the Royal Preston Hospital, where she works. Gregson was taken to a police station where she refused to be breathalysed and was given a urine test instead. It showed she had 205 milligrammes of alcohol in her body. The maximum allowed by law is 107. Gregson, who had no previous convictions, later admitted being in charge of the car while over the limit. She apologised and pleaded with the court to let her keep her licence, saying: \u2018I need my car to get to work at hospital as I work shifts.\u2019 Magistrates agreed and instead ordered ten points to be added to her licence. Gregson, from Preston, was also told to pay \u00a385 costs and a \u00a330 victims\u2019 surcharge. On her Facebook profile she lists Fifty Shades of Grey as one of her favourite books alongside What I Wish I Knew About Nursing. Pictures taken on Christmas Eve show her partying with her friends. Drivers can be prosecuted for being \u2018in charge\u2019 of a vehicle while over the alcohol limit. The offence is used when drunk people are caught either getting into or having just stopped their cars. They can be charged even if they are in the passenger seat if police think they were recently driving, as in Gregson\u2019s case.", "abstract": "A nurse named Faye Gregson was arrested on Christmas Eve for being nearly twice the drink-drive limit while parked at an angle on a zebra crossing in Blackpool.

{"article": "David Cameron today joked he had doubled the security around Larry the Downing Street cat after the'murder' of a dog at Crufts. The Prime Minister attacked the 'unbelievable awful' killing of the award-winning Irish setter Jagger, who was killed by poisoned meat allegedly fed to him at the dog show. He said he could not understand how anyone could poison a family dog and quipped that he would ramp up security around Number 10's resident cat. Prime Minister David Cameron today joked he had doubled the security around Larry the Downing Street. Mr Cameron, speaking to Heart radio, insisted he was not overly concerned about the safety of Larry. He said: 'He doesn't get up and get out much. I think he's probably pretty safe sitting on the chair of the hallway watching the world go by.' But he added: 'I'll double the security around him and make sure he's okay.' Mr Cameron's remarks come after the grief-stricken owners of Jagger said his death had left their nine-year-old son devastated, as they shared a series of heart-breaking photographs of the dog. The PM said: 'I can understand as a dog and cat lover myself, my heart goes out to a family who sees that happen. 'I remember listening to the owner on the radio talking about the toxicology report and how they had found lumps of meat which had poison in, you think who would go to such a length, who would do that? It's an unbelievably awful thing to do.' The Prime Minister attacked the 'unbelievable awful' killing of the award-winning Irish setter Jagger. Irish setter Jagger died 24 hours after returning from Crufts, the world's most prestigious dog show. A second dog  is reported to have died after appearing at Crufts, amid fears that at least six of the animals were deliberately poisoned at the world famous show. The shih tzu is believed to have died over the weekend, just hours after the'murder' of Irish setter Jagger. The three-year-old died on Friday after eating meat which his owners say was laced with poison. Today, Jagger's bereft co-owners are preparing to cremate the prize-winning dog at his rural home in Belgium, before scattering his ashes across a field where he used to love walking. It comes as the show's organisers, the Kennel Club, warned that anyone found putting the dogs' lives at risk could be prosecuted - a crime which can lead to 51 weeks in jail or a \u00a320,000 fine. Jagger's Belgian owner Aleksandra Lauwers said she will join her husband and 'devastated' son, Jeremy, today in scattering the ashes of her second 'beautiful child.' Jagger (pictured) is one of six dogs who are believed to have been poisoned at the world-famous show. Jagger's owners are convinced the dog was the victim of meat poisoning. Pictured: Jeremy, now nine, runs Jagger round a competition field. Mrs Lauwers shook with emotion yesterday as she told the Mail 'To the person who has done this I would say: I hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed my beautiful child. 'He was our love, our family member and the very best friend to our son. We are still in a state of shock. 'My son is devastated. He does not know how somebody could be so cruel and do this to an innocent and helpless animal. Why would anyone want to cause Jagger such a slow and painful death?' She realised something was very wrong when Jagger's jaw dropped and he started to tremble after they returned from Crufts to their large detached family home in the quiet village of Lauw in east Belgium on Friday evening. Just 24 hours after Jagger and death a vet found cubes of meat laced with a slow-acting toxin in his stomach and the family contacted local police. Toxology tests will be completed by the end of the week which should determine the cause of death, amid suggestions they could be rat poison or slug repellents. Before then Jagger will be cremated.", "abstract": "David Cameron has doubled the security around Larry the Downing Street cat after the alleged poisoning of a dog at Crufts.

Sgt. William Mudd and Capt. Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday. It is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report\u00a0released Wednesday by the DOJ \u00a0accusing the department of illegal practices targeting African-Americans. Twitty is seen in an undated photograph smiling as Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who gunned down Michael Brown, an unarmed, \u00a0African-American teen, has his arm around her. The two are seen appearing joyful among colleagues and friends, including Ferguson Mayor James Knowles. Scroll down for video. Sgt. William Mudd (left) and Capt.

Friends: Here, Twitty is seen among friends and colleagues, standing next to Darren Wilson (center), the Ferguson officer who killed an unarmed black teen, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles appears in the photo as well (back left, wearing a green shirt) However, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u00a0reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job for four years.' Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless, appearingly tribal, women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.' The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DOJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week. In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails, instead, the emails were forwarded along to others. *The list above is highlighted emails found in the DOJ's 102-page report on the Ferguson Police Department. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. Officials say that at least one of the email recipients was among city leaders who met with DOJ officials to discuss the investigation, the Dispatch reports. The report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case.' The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after Wilson fatally shot the unarmed black teen on Aug. 9, an action that sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light. A grand jury did not indict Wilson for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown. Though the Justice Department found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, the case did spark suspicions into the department's practices. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report'searing,' saying the investigation found the Ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents.' 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports. The mayor said the city has been carrying a surplus of nearly $5 million to handle expenses related to the reform.

Knowles said that while the DOJ did highlight many things in the report that must be addressed, there are also things that are an 'over reach.' Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down, Reuters reports, amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders. The report highlighted the department's practices saying the city's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department's approach to law enforcement and the role of Ferguson's municipal court.

Helps explain why Internet slowness is even more s***ty than usual.' But iiNet chief David Buckingham said any slow speeds customers were experiencing were due to issues with Telstra's copper network. 'We are having countless mass service disruptions on the Telstra copper network right now, so it might be people caught up in those who are commenting,' Mr Buckingham told the Herald.

'We have put it up in the foyer in a low key fashion. It's caused quite a few comments. So many people have relatives or ancestors with a connection in the Second World War.

{"article": "A 17-year-old who was caught attempting to flee Australia to join jihadi militants in the Middle East had also been stopped by police just one day earlier during a first escape attempt. Wearing a lime green cap and carrying a black backpack, the teen was removed from a plane at Sydney Airport on March 12 and interviewed by counter-terrorism officers, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed on Wednesday. However this was already the second effort the boy had made to escape the country after he had attempted to hop on a flight to Abu Dhabi - allegedly on his way to Syria - on March 11 before first being stopped, News Corp reports. The third teenager to be caught by authorities trying to join Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East, was stopped from leaving the country by federal police two days in a row. 'His name triggered the system and his passport was \u00adcancelled. He then turned up the next day and tried to board the same flight,' a senior source told News Corp. Police then intercepted the teen during his second attempt, detaining and interviewing him before releasing him to his parents. It comes after two teenage brothers were also discovered trying to travel to the Middle East earlier this month. The first incident occured on March 11 and the second on March 12. The boy is the third teenager government officials have intercepted and amongst about 200 people stopped from heading overseas to become foreign fighters with terrorist groups. He has since returned to his family again, with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO investigating the matter. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that while it was hard to believe people who had grown up in Australia's free and open society could be susceptible to brain washing by extremist groups such as Islamic State, it was clearly happening. 'It is very dangerous for you. It is very dangerous for others,' he told reporters in Canberra. It follows two brothers who were detained for doing the same earlier this month (pictured above) The siblings aged 16 and 17 were questioned by counter-terrorism officers before they were sent home to their mother in Sydney's south-west. There are fears that more teenagers could end up like\u00a0Abdullah Elmir (pictured) who has been dubbed the 'Ginger Jihadist' Elmir (front centre) has appeared in propaganda videos since he arrived in the Middle East (above) 'We will do everything we can to stop you if you do try.' The two brothers who were stopped earlier this month were aged 16 and 17. The siblings were south-west Sydney and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained. Authorities' suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage was searched. The latest teenager to be caught were trying to fly to the Middle East like notorious extremists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Mohamed Elomar (above) has caused a stir on social media after posting photos of him with weapons and severed heads. Meanwhile Khaled Sharrouf made international headlines after he posted photos of his children posing with guns. The above photograph is Sharrouf posing with his children in front of an Islamic State flag and rifles. They were stopped on the night of March 6, Mr Dutton said at the time of the revelation. Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State.

England captain Reece Oxford battles for the ball with Norway's Andreas Helmersen. The personal duel between Oxford, who plays for West Ham, and Helmersen was a feature of the game. England coach John Peacock is hoping to lead his team to the European Championship finals in Bulgaria. With home advantage in this final batch of qualifiers, England started as strong favourites to overcome Norway, Slovenia and Romania in their mini-group and reach the finals in Bulgaria. And they had the perfect start here when Sunderland man Wright smashed the ball home from six yards after Norway goalkeeper Kjetil Haug could only palm Nathan Holland's cross into his path. Their lead, however, lasted just seven minutes. The England defence switched off and Andreas Helmersen broke away down the left before squaring for striker Risa Birk to tap in. The remainder of the first-half was an open affair, but the hosts created the better chances. Leicester man Ndukwu twice struck the crossbar and Chelsea forward Ike Ugbo was denied by the Norway keeper when clean through. Ike Ugbo, of Chelsea, tries to win the ball off Norway's Joakim Barstad during the match at Burton. England forward Layton Ndukwu and John Saeter of Norway compete for the ball. England deserved a goal and it duly arrived on 57 minutes when captain Reece Oxford headed down a corner and Collinge, who plays for Stuttgart in Germany, spin to fire home from five yards. And victory was secured five minutes later when Ndukwu collected the ball wide left, advanced towards goal and finished from a tight angle. With one win under their belts, England now head to Chesterfield to play Slovenia on Monday night before rounding off the Elite Round qualifiers against Romania at Burton on Thursday. Peacock urged his team to build on this positive performance and kick on: 'I thought we were really good. They had a game plan, and I don\u2019t think there were any real surprises from the Norwegians, we expected them to play like that and we\u2019ve worked hard on that in training. England's Chris Willock tries to shield the ball from Norway's John Saeter. Marcus Edwards jumps for the ball under pressure from Tord Salte of Norway. 'We got off to a great start, then had a bit of a blip when we conceded, but in terms of the reaction it was really positive. 'I thought we played really well. The way we passed it about and controlled possession, not forcing things, it was good to see and we produced good football at times.

The study, carried out by LV= home insurance, found that a third of homeowners are stuck in homes that are too small for them, but are unable to upsize. Almost a quarter said they could not raise the deposit for a bigger home, while a sixth said they were waiting for prices to drop before even contemplating a move.

{"article": "Swansea manager Garry Monk believes the only way is up for Tim Sherwood as the two coaching course mates prepare to cross tactical swords at Villa Park. Monk and new Aston Villa boss Sherwood got to know each other on the same Football Association of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on Saturday with three Barclays Premier League points at stake. Sherwood got his break in management at Tottenham first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to Monk - and the former England midfielder has revived Villa's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the Premier League danger zone and into the semi-final of the FA Cup. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate Garry Monk. Sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the Villa Park managerial hot-seat. 'He's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group,' Monk said at his pre-match press conference. 'You need results to do that but they've got very good players there who obviously weren't playing to their full potential before Tim took over. 'But he's had an instant impact. He's a very honest guy, black and white, and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game. Garry Monk believes himself and Sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities. 'They're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us. 'We've got our own agenda, we want to achieve our best total of 47 points, and I think you've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against Tottenham and Liverpool. 'The actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at Villa.' The pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright, young British managers, even if the 46-year-old Sherwood is actually 10 years older than Monk who celebrated his first anniversary as Swansea boss last month. Swansea manager Monk observes his players during the training session at the Fairwood Training Centre. But Monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences. 'When Tim came in at Spurs he was already within the club at that time, albeit within a different coaching role,' Monk said. 'I came from a playing background into it and I wouldn't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that. 'But we've got the same desire, commitment and principles and are clear in what we want. 'I'm on the same coaching course as Tim and his views on football are very interesting. Monk believes the former Tottenham Hotspur boss will certainly take Aston Villa forward in the future.

But Sinclair has thrived under Sherwood with three goals in five games and Monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career. 'Scotty has been searching for regular football and it is good to see him playing,' Monk said. 'He did tremendously well for us and we will never forget what he did here.

{"article": "Cockroaches might not be the most beloved of all critters - but is it ethical to control their movement with mind-control technology? That\u2019s a debate engineers at Texas A&M University are stirring with their latest \u2018robo-roach\u2019 device, which can control the path a cockroach takes with wireless technology. They have created little backpacks for the bugs and implanted electrodes into their nervous system to control their movement. Scroll down for video. Texas engineers have developed a method to control cockroach movement. Their backpack stimulates the nervous system in the bugs' brains (image provided by Dr Hong Liang). Doing so allows the direction of their movement to be altered. It is different to previous technologies that stimulated antennae. This is not the first technology to turn cockroaches into controllable insects - others have even released products you can buy to create your own remote-controlled roach. But previous attempts to manipulate the movements of cockroaches relied on stimulating their antennae, tricking them into avoiding objects. The technology developed by Texas A&M University, meanwhile, works by stimulating nerves in the cockroach\u2019s brain to allow for greater control. The paper, published in the Journal of the\u00a0Royal Society Interface, details how the team built a small micro-controller, wireless receiver and a rechargeable lithium battery. These were packaged together in a \u2018backpack\u2019 weighing 0.007lbs (3g) that was attached to the cockroach. Next, they inserted electrodes into the body of a cockroach to stimulate its nervous system. By stimulating either left or right side, the team then found they could control the bug, although it only responded correctly about 60 per cent of the time. In tests, the researchers were able to control the movement of the cockroaches around obstacles (shown). While they can only control their direction for now, the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control, such as making it walk, run and stop on command. Speaking to The Guardian, lead researcher Dr Hong Liang said the benefits of such technology could include attaching cameras or sensors to cockroaches, and having them explore areas humans cannot - such as disaster zones. \u2018Insects can do things a robot cannot,\u2019 she said. \u2018They can go into small places, sense the environment, and if there\u2019s movement, from a predator say, they can escape much better than a system designed by a human. \u2018We wanted to find ways to work with them.\u2019 While they can only control their direction for now, the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control, such as making it walk, run and stop on command. In November 2014 researchers from North Carolina fitted the hardy creatures with electrical backpacks complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds. The idea is that cyborg cockroaches, or \u2018biobots\u2019, could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes, for example, and help emergency workers find survivors. \u2018In a collapsed building, sound is the best way to find survivors,\u2019 said Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at North Carolina State University. \u2018The goal is to use the biobots with high-resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that don't matter - like a leaking pipe. \u2018Once we've identified sounds that matter, we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero-in on where those sounds are coming from.\u2019", "abstract": "Engineers at Texas A&M University have developed a 'robo-roach' device that can control the path a cockroach takes with wireless technology.

Jane Revell, 53, who worked part-time at\u00a0Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, was found dead in a the jacuzzi in her back garden on December 18 last year. An inquest into her death  heard prior to her death she had been\u00a0'upset and worried' about appearing at a hearing to answer questions about the referral of a patient. Cancer nurse\u00a0Jane Revell, 53, (pictured) drowned herself in a hot tub four days before she was due to face disciplinary proceedings, the inquest into her death heard. Mrs Revell worked part-time\u00a0at Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, and had been due to  answer questions about the referral of a patient. The allegation was said to be 'of a minor nature' and not one which could lead to her dismissal, the hearing at Cannock Coroner's Court was told. The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's \u00a3270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub. She was\u00a0fully clothed except for her shoes. Earlier in the day, the mother-of-two and school governor had written a suicide note which she had put in a Christmas card and left in the kitchen. She had also sent a text message to her daughter Hannah, telling her to go to a neighbour's house after school. The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's \u00a3270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub in the back garden. Before her death, Mrs Revell had sent a text to her daughter Hannah telling her to go to a neighbour's house, instead of the family home (pictured) 'When Hannah and the neighbour arrived at the house at around 5pm they found the front door unlocked and Mrs Revell's car in the drive,'\u00a0Detective Constable Mark Bailey told the hearing. 'Mr Revell arrived home from work soon after and searched the garden before finding his wife's body in the hot tub. 'A farewell message was later found inside a Christmas card in the kitchen.' A post mortem examination revealed that she had drowned, and there was no trace of alcohol or drugs in her body. The inquest heard she was in good health and had no history of mental health problems. South Staffordshire Coroner Andy Haigh concluded Mrs Revell had committed suicide 'while stressed.' He said: 'She was a lady who was committed to her family, her community and her career. 'She did have some recent problems at work. 'These appear to have been of a minor nature, but with the benefit of hindsight they were not minor matters for Jane and are a major reason for her death. 'I fully accept that no-one in the family expected Jane to have done this, and I am very sorry that she should have done.' Speaking after the inquest, Dr Richard Soulsby, chief executive of Katharine House Hospice, paid tribute to Mrs Revell. 'Jane's contribution to the hospice over the last 12 years has been immeasurable and her death has been a huge shock to her friends, colleagues, and patients,' he said. 'She was a vibrant and greatly valued member of our team.'", "abstract": "A cancer nurse at a hospice in Stafford drowned herself in a hot tub four days before she was due to face disciplinary proceedings.

{"article": "There's a new true detective in town. A Texas police department has hilariously spoofed Matthew McConaughey's Lincoln car commercials, adding their own spin to reflect a night on the squad. McConaughey's ads are famous for the Academy Award-winning actor staring pensively through his window, contemplating life's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car. Sgt. Larry Wise of the Cedar Hill Police Department in Texas hilariously spoofed Matthew McConaughey's Lincoln Car ads, adding his own spin to reflect a night on the squad. McConaughey's ads are famous for the Academy Award-winning actor staring pensively through his window, contemplating life's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car. 'Sometimes you gotta go back to actually move forward, and I don't mean go back and reminisce or chase ghosts,' he says in twisty dialogue that would make his True Detective character Rust Cohle proud. Cedar Hill Police put Sgt. Larry Wise behind the wheel of a cop van for the parody, and at first Wise repeats McConaughey's dialogue word for word, in the same pensive deadpan voice. But things soon veer off from their original course. While McConaughey wonders about 'going back to where you came from', Wise talks about taking 'a big step back,' like 'from winning rookie of the year to getting a couple of reflection days off'. Wise pretends to nod off for a second as he wonders 'Who am I? Why am I still on duty? What is this on my fingers and why won't it come off?\u00a0Is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy I searched?' A prisoner makes a guest starring appearance, asking Wise if he's okay because he's only going five miles an hour. Wise's response? 'That's pretty good for an Explorer' 'You don't get into police work because it makes sense,' Wise then says. 'You do it cause you thought it really looked cool on TV, or cause med school was out of the question.' As McConaughey drives under the bright city lights, its gas stations and flashing sirens that reflect in Wise's window as he ponders yet another night on the job. 'I like being in here,' he says in the video. 'Driving around all night long contemplating the important questions in life like \"Who am I? Why am I still on duty? What is this on my fingers and why won't it come off?\"' 'Is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy I searched?' And, in the spoof, a prisoner makes a guest starring appearance, asking Wise if he's okay because he's only going five miles an hour. Wise's response? 'That's pretty good for an Explorer'. The video was posted on the Cedar Hill Police Department's Facebook page to celebrate hitting 4,000 Facebook likes. Lt. Colin Chenault told Daily Mail Online that he, Wise and fellow officer Kaleb Hazard came up with the idea after watching Jim Carrey's spoof of the ads on Saturday Night Live. The video has more than half a million views and has been shared over 12,000 times. Chenault attributes the success to the fact that the video humanizes police officers. 'I think people want to laugh at us and see us as real people,' he said. 'We want people to remember this video, it sheds a light not just on our city but on other officers as well, and remember that police officers are normal people like you and me.' 'We laugh at the same things and we want people to see us as they are - we just do a different job.' Both Chenault and Wise said they are happy they've created a something that is much more positive and comedic than the recent controversial videos featuring policemen around the country. 'Police officers don't like to be stereotyped either,' said Wise. 'So when something bad happens in another city, you're always going to have that percentage of the public, no matter what, think we're all corrupt and can't do anything right.' He added that to be able to put something out to humanize policemen and prove they're 'not all the same', and get such a response from the public, was 'outstanding'.

On Tuesday night, he scored twice against Mackay\u2019s Wigan for the second time this season to send Watford top of the Championship and a step nearer the Premier League. It was the sixth game in a row that Deeney has been on the scoresheet, muscling in to beat Ali Al-Habsi with a header nine minutes into the second half and then converting a penalty in stoppage time. For Wigan and his old manager, however, the threat of relegation to League One looms large two years after the club dropped out of the top-flight.

That\u2019s why I bought him (for Watford) in the first place. He\u2019s blossomed and he\u2019s by far and away the best centre-forward in the division in my opinion.\u2019 Despite the poor home form, Wigan had won their last four away games to give themselves a chance of survival and they had several chances to take the lead. Tommy Hoban had to throw his body in the way of Leon Clarke\u2019s goalbound effort, Sheyi Ojo blasted over when unmarked in a good position and Marc-Antoine Fortune had two opportunities. Deeney beats the challenge of Wigan's Gaetan Bong to score his side's opening goal at the DW Stadium. Boyce fells Watford's\u00a0Fernando Forestieri in the box to give away a penalty on a bad night for the hosts. But the promotion chasers went ahead in the 54th minute with a goal that was the product of classy build-up play and a brutal finish. Substitute Fernando Forestieri\u2019s clever pass gave Adlene Guedioura the opportunity to swing a cross to the far post where Deeney was charging in like an express train. The Watford skipper powered through Jason Pearce to meet the ball and head the ball emphatically past Al Habsi. Guedioura and Matej Vydra both went close with shots after that, and Guedioura thought he had doubled Watford\u2019s lead when his deflected effort beat Al Habsi but Emmerson Boyce hooked the ball away to safety from under his own crossbar. Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi is rooted to the spot as Deeney sends his second goal past him with a penalty. However Deeney made sure of victory in stoppage time, scoring from the penalty spot after Boyce had brought down Forestieri.

{"article": "Holiday death: Andrew Smyth, 32, from Surrey, is feared to have been a \u2018honeytrap\u2019 victim in Turkey. A British holidaymaker was killed and his bank account plundered after being lured by a woman he met on holiday in Turkey in a 'honeytrap', his parents insisted today. The body of Andrew Smyth, 32, was found dumped in undergrowth four miles away from a nightclub where he had been, and his bank account cleared out through a cash machine. But a coroner in Surrey recorded an open verdict - saying that he understood how the family concluded foul play, but could take the case no further after a four-year investigation. However, Mr Smyth\u2019s family believe his drink was spiked at the nightclub, before he was followed, robbed and murdered. His fully-clothed body was found face down in woodland. He had traces of heroin in his body - possibly from the spiked drink, toxicology tests showed. An inquest at Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told that the athletic electrician had flown to Antalya a week earlier for a fortnight\u2019s break at his father and stepmother\u2019s holiday home. His friend flew home after a week but Mr Smyth stayed, going out drinking on a Friday night with a woman he had met at the resort. However, at 3am the following morning, CCTV footage showed him leaving the club - shortly before a series of withdrawals were made from a cash machine, emptying his bank account. Hours later his body was spotted in a forest with no cash in his pockets other than small change. A post-mortem examination found a heroin metabolite, 6-MAM, in Mr Smyth\u2019s body - indicating that the Class A drug had been consumed before his death, in September 2010. Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, who carried out an autopsy at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford once Mr Smyth\u2019s body had been repatriated, could find no evidence of a fight or any injuries.\u00a0The original post-mortem examination was not carried out for five days. 'What we expected': Mr Smyth pictured with his mother, Celia Armstrong, who said she was 'disappointed' after a coroner returned an open verdict at an inquest into his death. He said the presence of 6-MAM showed that heroin specifically had been present, rather than any other opiates, and he had found water on the lungs - which was consistent with heroin toxicity. Toxicology tests showed he was below the drink-driving limit, with just 55mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, 35mg off the 80mg UK maximum. However the pathologist added that although the signs pointed towards opiate toxicity, given the state of decomposition, he felt unable to establish a cause of death. Dr Fegan-Earl added: \u2018An unusual fact is the location of Andrew\u2019s body, which seems to be at odds with what he was doing, enjoying himself in a club.\u2019 Mr Smyth grew up in Surrey and trained to be an electrician, before relocating to Swindon in Wiltshire, where he took on a new job and dated a number of women. He had flown to Turkey in September 2010 for two weeks with a woman he had met on dating website Plenty of Fish. Amanda Miles told the hearing that the pair had only met a few months earlier, kissed once and decided afterwards that they were better off as friends. They pair stayed at an apartment in Side owned by his father and his partner, then Lynne Cannon. Electrician: Mr Smyth had flown out for a fortnight\u2019s break at his father and stepmother\u2019s holiday home. Mr Smyth\u2019s father told the inquest that he had received regular phone calls and texts from his son while he was away, which was unusual - but he had been having trouble with Miss Miles. She conceded they had had a volatile friendship, and that they had argued over \u2018silly\u2019 things because Mr Smyth was often in a bad mood - which led to a row in the holiday resort one night. During the first week of the holiday, they decided Miss Miles would leave early and, after changing flights, she left Turkey on the Friday. That night Mr Smyth went out drinking at a bar called the Light House, but never came home. His decomposing body was later found dumped in a remote area of woodland by passer-by Adam Yesilova, who was collecting beer cans. Barman Soner Korkmaz told the hearing that Mr Smyth had gone to the club with a woman and the pair had dinner and drinks together. His companion, Emilya Agayeva, insisted he had vanished, forcing her to pawn her earrings for a taxi fare home after running out of money.

No, not the enormity of the money. This is a fortune which just keeps on growing and will carry on doing so all the way to the desert night of May 2 \u2013 and beyond as the pay-TV returns pour in. This is the latest picture Floyd Mayweather posted on shots.com as he trains for the Manny Pacquiao fight. And Pacquiao has also updated his Instagram account with this picture from Monday. Las Vegas was the only realistic option for the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao mega-fight. The $300million fight will be held at the MGM Grand which has hosted Mayweather's last 10 bouts. The latest dose of reality comes from promoter Bob Arum as he explains why, despite all the speculation to the contrary, Floyd Mayweather Jnr vs Manny Pacquiao was never going anywhere except Las Vegas. Not to New York, the preceding spiritual home of boxing. Not to the Philippines, where the national adoration of Pacquiao could have generated a second Thrilla in Manilla to follow in the immortal footsteps of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Not to the space odyssey of a stadium which is the new home of the Dallas Cowboys, even though it would have accommodated more than five times the number of spectators lucky and wealthy enough to acquire tickets at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Arum was glibly cited as the proponent of alternative venues. Not least because he took his PacMan to the house which Cowboys owner Jerry Jones built in Dallas for two fights each of which pulled in 50,000 plus crowds. Pacquiao's promoter was cited\u00a0as the proponent of alternative venues including Dallas and New York. Arum hosted two of Pacquaio's fights to the Dallas Cowboy's stadium in front of 50,000 fans. \u2018Not me,\u2019 said Arum as soon as Mayweather put pen to contract and he no longer had to muzzle himself for fear of jeopardising what may well become The Half-Billion-Dollar boxing match. \u2018Don\u2019t forget that I live here. \u2018All the workers in the entertainment and gaming industries, every restaurant and bar owner and all their waiters, every hotel executive and their employees, all the cab drivers and every maintenance man... they\u2019re all my neighbours. \u2018Ask yourselves. Am I going to let them down? Am I going to disappoint or upset the folks next door? \u2018That would have made life very difficult for me. But on top of that, this fight truly belongs in Las Vegas.\u2019 That is not just sentiment. Arum is a man who deals in hard economic reality. NFL star Tim Tebow visits Manny Pacquiao at training camp at the Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles. Pacquiao talks to trainer Freddie Roach as he continues his training at the Wild Card. He sees the numbers outside the arena \u2013 where 16,000 seats priced from $1,500 to $7,500 will treble boxing\u2019s gate record in Nevada to $60 million. He see past the pay-per-view TV returns which alone could generate upwards of $400 million. He sees this single event completing the recovery of the place where he lives from the economic recession which at one point threatened the future of the gaming as well as the boxing capital of the world. Las Vegas has still not managed to attract a US major league sports franchise but Arum says: \u2018This fight is three Super Bowls rolled in one.\u2019 He knows it is not only jobs in the short term which the richest fight of all time can secure but the medium term future of the entire city.

{"article": "An Australian wildlife warrior has gone where most people would not dare by filming himself swimming alongside deadly saltwater crocodiles. Beau Greaves has tried to show off the'sensitive side' of the predators and released extraordinary footage of him up close and personal with the reptile on his\u00a0YouTube channel. The 24-year-old crayfish diver took a dip in the Great Barrier Reef, in Queensland's far north, to capture hours of video, exploring the wildlife it had to offer - including stingrays and wobbegongs, commonly known as the carpet shark. Scroll down for video. Beau Greaves has always had a fascination with wildlife and in a new video he swims dangerously close to saltwater crocodiles. Mr Greaves spends nine months of the year on a trawler working as a crayfish diver near Cape York. On his YouTube page, Mr Greaves said he was a thrill seeker who never did things in halves. His sister, Ebony, told Daily Mail Australia this had always been the case. 'Beau is a very extreme person, as a little kid we grew up at\u00a0Lake Cooroibah [north of Queensland's Sunshine Coast],' she said. 'Ever since I could remember he would go out for hours by himself, and trawl up and down the lake and catch all kinds of snakes, spiders and eels and other exotic wildlife. 'One time he came home with a crab attached to his finger when he was five years old.' Ms Greaves said her brother had an unexplained connection with wildlife, which helped him swim unnoticed by animals. When asked if she and her family even feared for Mr Greaves' safety, his sister answered: 'Absolutely.' The 24-year-old is seen swimming alongside crocodiles in the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's far north. At no point in the video does the crocodile appear to behave aggressively towards the Sunshine Coast man. He said he had 'absolutely no fear' but he respected crocodiles and does not touch them with hands. 'To be honest, he's an extreme person. When he's not catching wildlife, he's into surfing and into extreme motocross riding,' she said. 'He always finds the extreme in everything he does. 'No matter how worried our family is... he loves what he is doing. 'I can't ever imagine him being an office person, he loves the wildlife.' Mr Greaves told\u00a0The Sunday Mail it was 'unbelievable' to be able to swim so closely with the crocodiles, an act which wildlife experts warned was detrimental to his safety. 'They're just a big old dinosaur, and they've got big teeth too,' the wildlife warrior said. This is a carpet shark, also known as a wobbegong, which Mr Greaves also dares to interact with. Here he is seen swimming with his head resting underneath the carpet shark, which looks to be unfazed with this. Mr Greaves also dares to give the shark a pat as he continues to explore the Great Barrier Reef. Mr Greaves is also a reptile carer on the Sunshine Coast and works for nine months of the year diving the coral reefs in remote Cape York for crayfish on a trawler. He uses his time living in the area to film his wildlife videos and gives him an opportunity to learn about dugongs, snakes, turtles, dolphins and whales. Mr Greaves believes he had a 'primal connection' with the dangerous beasts, which he helps them remain calm around him. 'I just gauge their mood, and if they're relaxed, it's all cool. I jump in and swim around with them,' he said. 'I love crocs. I've got absolutely no fear. But I do respect them. And I've learnt my lesson not to touch them.' At one point in the video, the 24-year-old is seen swimming near a stingray with its tail facing the diver. In a terrifying moment, he reaches out and prods the back of the animal with a rod close to its barb. A barb through the chest was what killed Mr Greaves' idol, Steve Irwin, who was known as 'The Crocodile Hunter'. The 24-year-old also dares to swim close to stingrays - which killed crocodile hunter Steve Irwin. He daringly reaches out and prods the stingray's tail with a rod in a terrifying moment. But Professor Grahame Webb, from wildlife sanctuary Crocodylus Park, said Mr Greaves was reducing his life expectancy by swimming so closely with crocodiles. 'Unless he is Doctor Dolittle and can talk to the animals, he's a croc snack waiting to happen,' Prof Webb told News Corp. 'Wow. He's got big kahunas. But that's really asking for it.' For those who think crocodiles that live in open water or reefs are not as deadly, Prof Webb said this was simply not the case.

World-record signing Bale had not scored in the nine games preceding the clash with Levante and had been the target of plenty of boos and whistles around the Santiago Bernabeu stadium; and following his opening goal on 18 minutes, the winger made a point of venting his frustration, covering his ears and kicking the corner flag.

{"article": "(CNN)The reported kidnapping of a Vallejo, California, woman for ransom this week was nothing but a hoax, police said. Vallejo police Lt. Kenny Park went as far as to call it a \"wild goose chase\" that wasted department resources. Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who reported the kidnapping Monday, are no longer cooperating with police, Park said. Huskins was found safe on Wednesday, more than 400 miles away in Huntington Beach. Officers from the Huntington Beach Police Department talked with Huskins, 29, at her father's apartment complex, department spokeswoman Jennifer Marlatt told reporters. The case has authorities scratching their heads. Huskins initially indicated she would be happy to talk with Vallejo police and provide details of what happened, according to Park. Anxious to talk with her, Vallejo police and the FBI sent a jet to Huntington Beach to fly her back to the Bay Area. When it was time to go, Huskins was a no show. \"As of right now, we have not heard from Miss Huskins and we are no longer in contact with any of the family members,\" Park said late Wednesday.  The family has retained an attorney. Like Huskins, Quinn isn't talking. Charges are possible in the case, Park said, but those will be decided by the district attorney once the investigation is complete. The quickly changing developments left authorities frustrated. Quinn called on Monday afternoon to report that his girlfriend had been kidnapped several hours earlier from his home. At the time, Park said that the case was being treated as a kidnap for ransom. Huskins' father, Michael, made an emotional appeal through CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco directed at the kidnappers: \"Don't hurt her, please don't hurt her.\" \"The biggest fear is the horror she might be going through... that's my biggest fear. The horror, she doesn't deserve that, not from anybody.\" \"It's like a nightmare that I can't wake up from,\" her father told the affiliate. \"This is not supposed to happen.\" Then, the San Franciso Chronicle posted an audio clip.  On it, a woman who identified herself as Denise Huskins says she has been abducted. \"My name is Denise Huskins. I am kidnapped, otherwise I'm fine,\" the voice says. \"Earlier today there was a plane crash in Alps and 158 people died. And one thing that people know about me is that I went to my first concert, me and my mom, to Blink 182 (last word is inaudible).\" The editor in chief of the Chronicle, Audrey Cooper, said the newspaper received a link to the audio file in an email. The Chronicle reported the anonymous email said Huskins would be \"returned safely (Wednesday). We will send a link to her location after she has been dropped off. She will be in good health and safe while she waits. Any advance on us or our associates will create a dangerous situation for Denise. Wait until she is recovered and then proceed how you will. We will be ready.\" Then came Wednesday. The Chronicle reported that Huskins' father said he received a voice mail from his daughter saying she had been dropped off at his apartment. He called police to ask that the authorities pick her up and make sure she was safe, he told the newspaper. \"I almost had a heart attack,\" he said, according to the Chronicle. \"I tried to get authorities to pick her up, but they kept asking me a bunch of questions. I said, 'Send a squad car.' I was hyperventilating.\" Authorities are unclear what exactly is going on. Or, if they know, they're not saying. Police said the requested ransom amount was $8,500.  The FBI is investigating the Huskins' financial records. About 40 detectives from various agencies and 100 support personnel \"worked around the clock\" on the case, leaving the community on edge, Park said. \"I can tell you that our investigation has concluded that none of the claims has been substantiated,\" he said. \"And I can go one step further to say this:  That this was not a random act and that the members of our community are safe and that they have nothing to fear.\" \"It's disappointing. It's disheartening,\" he said. CNN's Dan Simon, Tony Marco, Faith Karimi, Ashley Fantz, Elan Bird, Michael Martinez, Stella Chan, Rosalina Nieves and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.", "abstract": "The reported kidnapping of Denise Huskins in Vallejo, California, for ransom was a hoax, according to police.

James Mort has told of the terrifying moment he was buried alive in an avalanche while skiing. The Sydney man penned a blog post about his experience, saying he wanted to raise more awareness of the dangers of an avalanche. On his Tumblr, the Australian wrote he had tried to outrun it by skiing over the top of a frozen creek, but was unsuccessful. 'I looked up just in time to watch the avalanche envelope me,' Mr Mort said. 'The last thing I managed to do before I was completely buried was to reach as high as I could above the snow with my left arm and ski pole.' It was this decision that saved Mr Mort's life and helped his friends locate him. Mr Mort was with his two friends, Daniel O'Sullivan (left) and Andrew Sebesfi (right), at the time. Mr Mort's friends started to dig him out from under the metres of snow after the avalanche. He wrote on his blog he found the whole experience terrifying, saying he thought he was going to die.

Since the turn of the year, Liverpool - led by the form of Philippe Coutinho - have picked up 20 points from eight games at a remarkable two and a half points per game. Arsenal, with 18 points from eight games, and Chelsea, who have 14 from seven, have been the next best in the Premier League this calendar year, but Liverpool's quest for Champions League football has outstripped all their rivals. Liverpool, with the help of some stunning goals from Philippe Coutinho, are one of Europe's form sides. Brendan Rodgers' team have climbed to fifth in the Premier League table, just two points behind Man United. Arsenal have also begun 2015 well in the league, with 18 points from eight games since New Year's Day. In the top five leagues in Europe only Wolfsburg, who have won five and drawn one of their six games this year, have picked up points at a better rate. The German side have narrowed the gap to Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich since the beginning of January, but still trail the champions by eight points. With striker Bas Dost in remarkable form - with 13 goals in his eight games since January 1 - and former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings behind him, Wolfsburg now look nailed on for a Champions League spot. In fact, qualification for Europe's biggest competition links all of the top form teams, with few of 2015's best performers actually challenging for the title in the top leagues around the continent. Brendan Rodgers celebrates Liverpool's win against Manchester City which continued their great form. In Spain, Valencia's excellent run of just one defeat and one draw in nine games this year has lifted them to within a point of Atletico Madrid in third place, though they are still eight points short of Real Madrid at the top of the table. The most remarkable upsurge in form comes from Caen, who have picked up 19 points from eight games, having only earned 15 from their  19 matches in the first half of the season. The run has seen them earn a 2-2 draw against PSG and beat Marseille 3-2 having trailed 2-0 in both games. Wolfsburg striker Bas Dost is Europe's sharpest marksman in 2015, with 13 goals in his last eight games. The Dutch striker has been a revelation in 2015, having only scored once before the turn of the year. Emiliano Sala scored against Marseille as Caen came back from two goals down. Remy Vercoutre, the Caen keeper, salutes the fans after his side's remarkable run continued in Marseille. On-loan Argentine foward Emiliano Sala, signed from Bordeaux at the end of January, has scored four times in the last three games as Caen have climbed from bottom of the league on New Year's Day to a comfortable mid-table spot, five points above the drop zone. Only in Italy have the team top of the league started 2015 with the best form. Juventus have earned 19 points from nine games - the same number as city-rivals Torino - to stretch their lead over Roma at the top of Serie A to nine points.

It was meant as a way to celebrate National Foreign Languages Week--each day, the announcements and pledge at Pine Bush High School would be recited in a different tongue. However, the outrage it caused in some students and parents quickly forced administrators to issue an apology and a promise to henceforth only recite the Pledge of Allegiance in English. Now, lines have been drawn in Pine Bush (pop. 1,600) as some students and teachers are outraged that an apology was issued at all while others applaud the decision and say the pledge should never have been recited in a language other than English. Scroll down for video. Outrage: Pine Bush High School in Upstate New York celebrated National Foreign Languages Week by reading the pledge in different tongues and caused outrage Wednesday by reading it in Arabic. School\u00a0Superintendent Joan Carbone told the Times Herald-Record the controversy has 'divided the school in half.' 'Something that was supposed to be good but turned out not to be,' Carbone admitted. The attempt at teaching a lesson in multiculturalism caused a backlash almost immediately. The Herald-Record reports that the broadcast by\u00a0student assembly president Andrew Zink was 'greeted by catcalls and angry denunciations in classrooms throughout the school.' By Wednesday afternoon, Principal Aaron Hopmayer had apologized in a schoolwide announcement. The school would also soon post an apology to its website. 'The intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than English still pledge to salute this great country,' the statement read. 'We sincerely apologize to any /students, staff or community members who found this activity offensive. In our school District the Pledge of Allegiance will only be recited in English as recommended by the Commissioner of Education.'

Students came out both against the reading and against the backlash as\u00a0Superintendent Joan Carbone said the controversy had 'divided the school in half' Though he didn't make the decision to make the day's announcements in Arabic himself, according to TWC News, Zink says he was perfectly okay with reading the Arabic script for the day, though he knew it would be controversial. 'I knew exactly what would happen,' he told the Herald-Record. 'I knew many wouldn't support it.' That includes many of the student politician's constituents at Pine Bush. 'Here's my issue. You made the decision to turn the school against itself, a move you knew would make Pine Bush look bad,' student Alan Bavolar tweeted to Zink. Student Alex Krug also opposed the recitation. 'It's the Pledge of Allegiance, we're saying it to the American flag. I think it should be said in English. It is foreign language week but we don't even offer Arabic in Pine Bush High School,' he said. Others supported Zink's decision and were appalled by the backlash, like senior Miranda Monroe, who tweeted:.

The man arrested by police yesterday on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence has been released on bail, police say. A spokesman for\u00a0North Yorkshire Police said the man, who is a 59-year-old married father-of-two from the York area, was released on bail 'to allow detectives time to follow up lines of inquiry'. Searches at a linked property were completed last night, police said. Yesterday, officers could be seen searching a semi-detached house in a quiet cul-de-sac in York. A spokesman said yesterday that Miss Lawrence, who was 35 when she went missing, had not been found. Claudia's family have been informed about today's developments. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, repeated his plea for people not to identify the suspect. He said: 'I am very grateful to the media and the public for supporting my request that this individual should under no circumstances be identified, either in traditional media or on social media platforms. 'That is because identification is an issue and publishing this man's identity could cause serious harm to my investigation. 'This continues to be the case, even though the man has been released on bail, and I must ask that the media and public continue to support me and make no attempt to identify him, his place of work or his home address.' Her parents, Peter and Joan, were told about the arrest shortly before it was made public and are being supported by trained officers. Officers from\u00a0North Yorkshire Police were yesterday pictured searching a property in a quiet cul-de-sac in York. Another property was searched overnight, and the man was bailed earlier today. A spokesman for the North Yorkshire force said the man had been released\u00a0'to allow detectives time to follow up lines of inquiry' (pictured, an officer searches a house in York yesterday) The father-of-two drank in the same pub as the missing university chef and lives within half a mile of her home in York. Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at work in March 2009. North Yorkshire Police began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of the city, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said he was 'actively pursuing new leads' and that his team had made'significant progress' since the force began reviewing the case in 2013. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef. The family of Claudia Lawrence have been informed of today's developments, it has been reported. Yesterday her father, Peter, said the news of an arrest was 'encouraging' The arrest came days after police released previously unseen CCTV of a mystery man caught on camera walking towards the back of her terraced house on the evening she was last known to be alive. The footage, released to mark the anniversary of Miss Lawrence's disappearance, was taken at around 7.15pm on March 18 showing a man walking towards the rear of the missing chef;s house. The camera picks him up returning about one minute later and he appears to be carrying a bag over his shoulder. As he walks back to the main road he is seen to stop briefly as another man walks in front of him.

The moon is pelted with cosmic debris all the time, but this relatively recent crater was created by an object the size of a small boulder. Scientists watched the object explode as it hit the surface in Mare Imbrium creating a flash of light 10 times as bright as anything ever recorded on the moon before. Scroll down for video. Incredible before (left) and after (right) images reveal a fresh lunar scar created by the biggest ever explosion recorded on the moon surface. Slide the middle bar to see how the moon's surface changed after impact. When a meteoroid strikes the moon, a large portion of the impact energy goes into heat and excavating a crater. However, part of it also goes into generating visible light, which results in a brilliant flash at the point of impact. The images reveal intricate details of the resulting impact crater and could help scientists learn more about how craters form. The brightest flash occurred on March 17, 2013 with coordinates 20.6\u00b0N, 336.1\u00b0E. The team predicted the crater's size based on the energy, and then eagerly awaited Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera;s next pass over the location to confirm their calculations. Being able to get observations before, during and after the impact is a valuable opportunity to understand impact events better. Four different mages of a crater formed on the moon, March 17, 2013; each scene is 1837ft (560 metres) wide.\u00a0The brightest flash occurred on March 17, 2013 with coordinates 20.6\u00b0N, 336.1\u00b0E. Comparing the actual size of the crater to the brightness of the flash helps validate impact models. The crater itself is small, measuring 61.7ft (18.8 metres) in diameter, but its influence is large; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres. More than 200 related surface changes up to 19 miles (30km) away were noted. Scientists could be closer to finding water on the moon - a discovery that could help create rocket fuel and breathable air for future colonies. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool, Nasa scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon craggy deposits. And they've found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area; the slopes of craters in the moon's southern hemisphere facing the South Pole. These slopes could be mankind's best hope finding drinkable water on the lunar surface, they claim. Hydrogen could be found as either hydroxol - which is a single atom bound with a single oxygen atom - or it may be two hydrogen atoms bound with oxygen. Scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking or its components \u2013 hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 may be used to manufacture rocket fuel or even breathable air. Not only did the LROC images reveal intricate details of ejecta distribution, but they also offered a valuable opportunity to study the structure of the top meter of the regolith. Regolith is a term that refers to a soil that is lacking organic material. The soil on the moon is formed slowly over time as micrometeorites impact the surface and slowly grind rocks into a fine powder. As the fresh soil grains sit on the surface, they are exposed to radiation and slowly become darker and redder. This is largely caused by a reduction of iron in minerals to iron metal \u2013 reverse of rusting that happens on Earth. This slow change in reflectance and colour is generally referred to as space weathering; fresh soil is referred to as immature, and weathered soil is mature. Several surprises were revealed in the before and after image pairs around the new crater. Conventional thought predicted that the new crater should be surrounded by a high reflectance ejecta with some patchy debris spreading out two or three diameters. 'The high reflectance was there, but three other zones were discovered,' said Mark Robinson, a professor in ASU's School of Earth and Space Exploration and LROC's principal investigator. 'At the edge of the high reflectance ejecta was a low reflectance zone, then, beyond that, another high reflectance zone, and beyond that, another low reflectance zone.' It's not easy to find new impact craters because most of them are very small. The only way to really do this is to have a before image and an after image to compare. With the help of the automated tool, the team has identified 225 new impact craters ranging in size from 4.9ft to 140ft (91.5 meters to 43 metres) and over 25,000 small changes known as'splotches'. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool (artist's impression pictured), Nasa scientists discovered the crater itself is small, measuring 61.7ft (18.8 metres) in diameter, but its influence is large; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres.", "abstract": "Scientists have discovered a fresh lunar scar created by the biggest explosion ever recorded on the moon's surface.

{"article": "A DIFFERENT KIND OF WEATHER. by William Waldegrave. (Constable \u00a320) At the start of the Falklands War in 1982, William Waldegrave, then a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government, was standing in the division lobby of the House of Commons when he saw Thatcher and her entourage of \u2018toadies\u2019 marching towards him. He felt compelled to say something, so, with the U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig at the time trying to broker a British \u2018sell-out\u2019 to the Argentinians, he asked: \u2018Where do the Americans stand, Prime Minister?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know, William,\u2019 came the immediate reply. \u2018But I know where they are going to stand.\u2019 Would that David Cameron could deal so unequivocally with the White House, but then none of Thatcher\u2019s successors have, least of all the pusillanimous Tony Blair, whom Waldegrave compares with Ted Heath. Margaret Thatcher (right) is once said to have fought off\u00a0Norman Tebbit (left) with a snarling remark in\u00a0Waldegrave's defence. This is surprising, for Waldegrave was a passionate Heath loyalist before transferring his allegiance to Thatcher. But he is surely right when he asserts that Heath\u2019s great disappointment in life was that the patriotic, liberal Conservative Party in which he believed so fervently \u2014 \u2018he and it were family\u2019 \u2014 did not return his devotion. And in that respect Waldegrave is reminded of Blair, who \u2018genuinely thought \u2014 and thinks \u2014 that he created a family called New Labour which loved him\u2019. In fact it was success that New Labour loved, not Blair. This absorbing memoir contains some choice gossip as a counter-balance to Waldegrave\u2019s insightful political analysis. Getting back to Heath, he recalls one of the old curmudgeon\u2019s dinner parties \u2014 \u2018not occasions of much merriment\u2019 \u2014 at which Emma Soames gamely tried to enliven proceedings with an anecdote about her brother Nicholas, who had just been selected to contest a tough seat in Glasgow. At a raucous selection meeting, very unlike anything in the Home Counties, the prospective MP had been grasped by the lapels and asked, \u2018Are ye married?\u2019 Around Heath\u2019s table, the diners waited expectantly for the end of an amusing story, but Soames suddenly and mystifyingly stopped speaking. Driving her home later, Waldegrave asked if she\u2019d forgotten the punchline? \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018I was on autopilot and got that far without remembering that after Nicholas admitted to being unmarried, the response was: \u201cOch, not another Tory poofter!\u201d \u2019 She hadn\u2019t wanted to offend her illustrious host, whose sexuality was always the subject of speculation \u2014 though Waldegrave adds that in relation to the Scotsman\u2019s allegation, it was not \u2018as far as anyone I ever knew could discover, true\u2019. Waldegrave\u2019s own background differs markedly from those of two of his Tory heroes, Heath and Thatcher, if rather less from that of another, the grouse-shooting enthusiast Harold Macmillan, whom he recalls silencing another dinner party, this time at Waldegrave\u2019s own house, by turning to his neighbour and declaring: \u2018Such a pity they abolished the gold sovereign, you know. What does one tip one\u2019s loader?\u2019 Waldegrave's privileged background was very different to that of his Tory hero, Margaret Thatcher (pictured) The seventh and youngest child of an earl, directly descended from King James II, Waldegrave is himself the very definition of a toff. And he grew up privileged not just socially and materially but also intellectually. His parents\u2019 friends included the philosopher Isaiah Berlin. He was educated at Eton, Oxford and Harvard. His accent alone opened doors, as he made his way in the world in the Sixties. As a scruffy, long-haired student, he once tried to check in for the night at the Great Western Hotel at Paddington, admitting that he had no money on him but would pay once they sent him the bill. The cut-glass vowels, and his explanation that there had once been a locomotive on the Great Western line named after his family \u2014 The Earl Waldegrave \u2014 secured him the room. For those of us who do not come from such lofty beginnings, there is something beguiling yet also appalling about the upper-class milieu Waldegrave describes so well. After his engagement to Victoria Rothschild ended \u2014 her father, the political power-broker Victor Rothschild, had made a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of him \u2014 he found a letter to his own father from a fellow Wy", "abstract": "William Waldegrave's memoir, \"A Different Kind of Weather,\" offers political analysis and juicy gossip from his time as a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher's government. Waldegrave compares Tony Blair to Ted Heath and discusses Heath's disappointment that the Conservative Party did not return his devotion. The memoir also delves into Waldegrave's privileged background and the upper-class milieu he navigated."}

As the Boeing 777 was in airspace over Scotland, the pilot reportedly found a problem with the oxygen supply in the cabin, and declared their intent to return to its airport of origin. After the plane took a detour over the Irish Sea to 'dump fuel' it returned to London safely with all 218 passengers and 14 crew unharmed. The plane bound for Seattle was snapped over Coventry during its return to London Heathrow. The plane was given priority to land at Heathrow forcing other incoming flights into a holding pattern during one of the airport's busiest periods. A spokesperson for British Airways told MailOnline Travel that the aircraft returned to Heathrow 'as a precaution due to a suspected technical problem.' 'Our pilots are highly trained to deal with these scenarios,' said the spokesperson. The plane was around an hour into the flight to Seattle when it declared an emergency over Scotland. A diversion then took place over the Irish Sea as the plane was forced to dump fuel. With regards to being forced to dump fuel, BA added: 'This is standard procedure. The aircraft has to dump fuel before landing to make sure it is not too heavy.' One Twitter user spoke of how he had picked up on his radio scanner that 'the crew were on oxygen masks while another report claimed the pilot was wearing a mask.

The 37-year-old Leeds prop forward is currently completing a masters degree in sports management and will start his new job when he brings his illustrious career to a close at the end of the season. Peacock's new role will see him responsible for, amongst other things, contract negotiations, club strategy, recruitment and pre-season training camps. Jamie Peacock (centre right) has been named the new football manager of Super League club Hull KR. Friday's announcement ends any lingering speculation about the former Bradford skipper playing on beyond his 38th birthday in December. Hull KR chairman Neil Hudgell said: 'We are delighted to have secured Jamie to the full-time position of football manager for the next two years. 'He is a proven champion at the highest level in our sport and we look forward to working with him, drawing on his experiences and contacts and generally raising the profile and performance of the club in key areas. 'I'm sure he will have a big role to play in helping to attract young English talent to Hull Kingston Rovers and in helping to develop a winning culture on and off the field.' Peacock has won a record eight Super League Grand Finals as well as making over 500 appearances for Leeds, Bradford, Yorkshire, England and Great Britain. The Leeds prop will retire from playing at the end of the season and take up his new role at the club. He was named Man of Steel in 2003 and stepped down as England captain in 2012 to concentrate on his club career and will complete a 10th and final campaign with his home-town club. He was awarded the MBE three years ago for services to the sport. Leeds say Peacock was offered an off-field role at Headingley but wanted a fresh challenge. Peacock said: 'I have had a great time at Leeds and learnt so much about how the club is run from top to bottom. 'The Rhinos are a blueprint for a successful sporting business and the challenge for me now is to take those lessons and try and implement my own thoughts in a new environment. 'Hull KR are a club with huge potential within a city that is rugby league mad and having invested wisely in their facilities in recent years. I know a number of people over there already and I am looking forward to working with Chris Chester, Willie Poching, Mike Smith and Neil Hudgell in my new role. Peacock was England captain a few years ago but is excited about his new off-field role. 'Whenever we have gone over there to play, it is clear Rovers have a fanatical supporter base. I think it is vital that you have a hard core of good people who want the club to succeed to be able to build and plan for development in the future. 'Now that I have the next chapter of my career finalised, I am fully focused on finishing my time with Leeds as strongly as possible and leaving my home-town club in the best possible position.' Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington said: 'I think this is an inspired appointment by Hull KR and I know Jamie will be very good at what will be a very different challenge. 'He has been at the heart of all our success over the past decade and his performances and influence at the club cannot be overestimated. He will leave a lasting legacy and all our best wishes will be with him when he swaps his training kit for a new suit at the end of the season.'", "abstract": "Former England rugby captain Jamie Peacock will become Hull KR's football manager at the end of the year.

Known as Blood Falls, the dramatic colour comes from the two million-year-old iron-heavy brine trapped under the ice. Now, for the first time, scientists have taken uncontaminated samples from deep beneath the glacier in the hope of finding microbial life. In the vast, white expanse of Antarctica, one glacier bleeds a shocking red. Known as Blood Falls, the dramatic colour comes from the two million-year-old iron-heavy seawater trapped under the ice. They believe that 'extremophiles' possibly living under the surface could be unique in their ability to survive \u2013 and they may even help in the search for alien life on other planets. Scientists recently sent a probe into the ice of Taylor Glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red-stained feature. 'This is going to be an exciting sample to play with,' Jill Mikucki, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Tennessee told The Antarctic Sun. She explained that Blood Falls' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron-rich, brine liquid. Its chemistry is changed by bacteria, which transforms sulphur and iron compounds in order to survive. Pictured is the\u00a0drill camp on top of Taylor Glacier.\u00a0Blood Falls' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron-rich, brine liquid.Its chemistry is changed by bacteria, which transforms sulphur and iron in order to survive. The Midge (Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration) project, led by Professor Mikucki has developed a unique probe, dubbed EnEx-IceMole. Pictured is the\u00a0IceMole poised for action. When the liquid oxidises at the surface, it creates a blood-red colour. But to learn more about the bacteria, scientists needed samples that were oxidised. The Midge (Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration) project, led by Professor Mikucki developed a unique probe, dubbed EnEx-IceMole. It looks like a rectangular metal box with a copper head and ice screw that can melt through ice,. 'It can drive curved trajectories through bulk ice. It can go sideways, up and down. If you want to reach any point, you can go there,' Dirk Heinen, a German physicist told The Antarctic Sun. To help the probe navigate, scientists sent acoustic pulses from the surface into the ice. This is similar to a GPS but uses different kinds of waves that use sound to track the position of the IceMole. Cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment can cause snow to appear red. Snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it. Anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light, which looks white. Other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple, for instance, reflects only mostly the green wavelength. But, as reported by JSTOR, when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue.\u00a0The reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) \u2018As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,\u2019 the NSIDC explains. While most of the light is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue. When you see just the surface of a pack of snow, the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice. But if you look into a significant amount of snow, about 3.3ft (one metre) or so, more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end. When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason.\u00a0This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment. Also known as \u2018watermelon snow\u2019, it is \u2018most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions\u2019. The team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at Blood Falls. They also used seismometers to image the ice and bedrock below, and GPS units to track glacial movement. The team are now in the process of analysing the samples. 'It offers us a portal, or window, to the subglacial world \u2026 a sample of material from that ice-covered interior,' said Professor Mikucki. Scientists say the results could reveal how life could exist on moons like Saturn's Enceladus and Jupiter's Europa. Both moons are believed to have liquid oceans beneath icy crusts.

'If you love dogs like I do, the please never buy or wear leather, whether it comes from a dog, a cow or any other animal.' In December, PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk said: 'PETA is sure that Britain, Australia and the U.S. are not exempt from the dog leather trade. 'Many British high-street retailers are importing cheap leather from China, so products made from dog skin are almost certainly on the shelves and in people's wardrobes. 'Skin looks the same, whoever it comes from, and Chinese dog killers are not likely to advertise their skins honestly, so it's impossible to tell if those leather gloves or wallets are made out of dog, cow, pig, or goat skin. 'PETA is calling on British shoppers to consider the terror that dogs and other animals endure when they're mercilessly slaughtered and make the safe, vegan choice in clothing and accessories for the holidays and every day.' Without conducting expensive DNA tests, it is virtually impossible to know exactly what kind of animal   leather is made from.

{"article": "You've heard of wedding crashers. Joey DiJulio is a bachelor party crasher - of sorts. For weeks, the father-of-one from the Seattle suburbs found himself getting emails from people he didn't know about a bachelor party 2,800 miles away in Philadelphia and a groom he's never met. He saw names of the city's landmarks like Reading Terminal Market thrown around in the emails but couldn't put his finger on where they were located until he searched the names online. The wrong guest: Joey DiJulio of Burien, Washington, started receiving emails from people he had never met about a bachelor party. He then came clean about the mistake, but the groom decided to invite him anyway. 'I had no idea what any of these places are,' said DiJulio, 31, who's never been to the Northeast. 'After Googling them, everything was pointing to Philadelphia.' It turns out DiJulio, an information technology worker and a married father of one in Burien, Washington, had been mistaken for a friend of the groom with a similar last name. He sat as a 'fly on the wall' for much of the email chain until Monday, when he broke the news after the groom's brother wanted a headcount of people attending the party. But it didn't end there. Groom Jeff Minetti, 34, figured: Why not still invite him? The Philadelphia real estate agent asked him to attend both the bachelor party March 28 and his wedding May 2 in New Jersey. 'This is the city of brotherly love,' Minetti said, even telling DiJulio he could be his best man. 'Any and all are welcome.' The groom: When those who were invited to the bachelor party saw a picture of Joey DiJulio they said he could actually be related to the groom - Jeff Minetti. DiJulio went online and set up a GoFundMe\u00a0page to tell his story and raise money to cover his travel. In less than a week, he's already hit his goal of a little more than $1,200 and is putting any more money raised toward Minetti's honeymoon. The groom promises the bachelor party will be a low-key affair at some bars, maybe a casino, to watch March Madness unfold. And while he won't actually get to be the best man \u2014 that's reserved for Minetti's 11-year-old cousin \u2014 DiJulio has his plane ticket ready to go for next weekend to see a city he's never been to and hang out with a group of guys he's never met. He set up a GoFundMe page when he learned he was invited, and has since raised more than $2,000. From the groom Jeff Minetti:. People,. Has anyone else noticed now that Jeff has been rocking the beard for a while - he looks like a middle aged Pavarotti? At times, he also has ventured into a bit of hipster phase. In addition to publicly questioning his fashion choices, his bachelor party will be a good time for us to celebrate him leading up to his wedding. Joe DiJulio finally comes clean:. Hi All,. So, I have no idea who any of you guys are, but I have been enjoying being a fly on the wall hearing about the plans for this bachelor party over the last few months. I'm assuming my E-Mail address was added to the list by mistake (perhaps a typo of someone else?). I live out in Seattle, WA and although for a moment I thought it might be funny to just show up and be that guy nobody knows but everyone wonders \"who is that guy?\", buying a plane ticket for a cross-country flight just to crash a bachelor's party might be a bit over the top (although it would be epic!). Nonetheless, I do hope you guys have a great time and I'd like to take a moment to wish the best of luck in life to the groom! Cheers! Joey DiJulio. Seattle, WA. Members of the party start to reply. I say everyone forks up an extra $20 and we get Joey a plane ticket to Philly! and. I just facebooked Joey DiJulio in WA, and if this is you - you actually look like you could be related to groom. MIND BLOWN. Mr DiJuio replies about the picture on Facebook. Haha... Yes, that is indeed me with my (now 2-year old, she was about 3-months there) daughter, Kaylee. Speaking of bachelor parties, weddings, and the like, that shot was actually taken at a wedding for a buddy of mine who also, coincidentally, happens to now live out on the east coast (Boston). Small world! Indeed, I think I recall seeing a picture of the groom over the last few months, and noticed this as well. I'm of course glad to know he's a studly guy - His soon-to-be-wife is a lucky woman!

{"article": "Harrison Ford's flying ability was called into question in an official report following his first aviation crash, Daily Mail Online can reveal. The Hollywood star, who was rushed to hospital after crashing a vintage plane in Venice, California on Thursday, also slammed a helicopter into a riverbed back in 1999. It is not believed that Ford, 72, is to blame for his latest - and what is his third - aviation incident at Penmar Golf Course near Santa Monica Municipal Airport, with early reports suggesting engine failure is at fault. But an official report into Ford's October 1999 accident, obtained by Daily Mail Online, reveals it was caused by 'the pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery'. Ford had flown the helicopter from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles 45 miles northwest towards Santa Clarita when he hit trouble. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Full recovery: Ford was rushed from the scene bleeding heavily from a head wound, his injuries were described only as'moderate' and he is expected to recover fully. Pictured, an aerial view of the crash. Rescue: Harrison Ford is treated at the scene of his crash in Venice, California, yesterday. The pilot was practicing autorotations to a power-on recovery. When he attempted to recover the power, the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter landed hard, hitting on the rear heels of both skids. The flight instructor said that when he saw the pilot was late adding power, he attempted to correct the situation but was unsuccessful. The surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand. The left skid heel contacted a log that was embedded in the sand and the helicopter pitched forward onto the skid toes and rolled over onto its left side. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows:. The pilot's delay in adding power during a power-on recovery from an autorotation, which resulted in a hard landing and rollover. The flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight was also causal. Source: NTSB. Ford was practicing 'auto rotations' - an emergency landing technique that simulates engine failure. He had completed one 'auto-rotation' but on his second he was 'late bringing in the power', according to the documents. As a result, when Ford attempted to recover, the helicopter engine did not respond quickly enough and the aircraft began plummeting to the ground. The unidentified flying instructor who was aboard with the actor was forced to take over the controls and try to level the helicopter but he was unable to do so and the aircraft came crashing down into the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita and flipped over. Luckily Ford, and the unnamed instructor, were unharmed in the crash but the helicopter was'substantially damaged', according to the document. Coincidentally the helicopter was registered to MG Aviation \u2013 the same firm to which the 1942 vintage plane involved in Ford's latest crash is registered to. The official report, which does not name Ford or his instructor, states: 'On October 23, 1999, at 1115 hours Pacific daylight time, a Bell 206-L4, N36R, landed hard and rolled over in the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California. 'The helicopter, operated by MG Aviation, Teterboro, New Jersey, under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, was substantially damaged.' The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) document goes on to say that the pilot reported that he'successfully completed one practice autorotation and entered a second approximately 600 feet agl.' It adds: 'When he attempted to recover power, the engine did not respond as quickly as anticipated and the helicopter settled hard into the soft creek bed.' The certified flying instructor (CFI) flying with the Star Wars legend, reported that, 'the pilot had been late bringing in the power and he had gotten on the controls during the flare to help the pilot and level the helicopter. 'The pilot reported that when he realized there was a lack of power, he tried to push the nose over. 'Both the pilot and CFI applied full collective, and reported that there was not sufficient rotor rpm to effectively cushion the landing, causing the helicopter to land on the heels of both skids. 'The surface of the dry riverbed was mostly soft sand; the aft end of the left skid contacted a 12-inch-diameter log that was embedded within the riverbed. Experienced: Harrison Ford at the controls of his helicopter in February last year. 'The tip of the left skid nosed into the sand and the helicopter rolled over onto its left side.' Tests carried out on the helicopter following the crash found 'no abnormalities' in the cockpit controls, engine or other parts of the aircraft.

That's the finding of a new study that has shown how neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called 'nonsense' words. During tests, brain scans revealed the new words appear as shapes rather than a group of letters in what researchers behind the study have dubbed a 'visual dictionary.' When we learn how to write, our brain doesn't learn individual letters, instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole, according to new research. Brain scans revealed neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called 'nonsense' words in what's been dubbed 'visual dictionary' The study, carried out at Georgetown University Medical Centre, suggests brain is 'holistically tuned' to recognise complete words, according to the researchers. Lead author Dr Maximilian Riesenhuber from the Laboratory for Computational Cognitive Neuroscience\u00a0said: 'We are not recognising words by quickly spelling them out or identifying parts of words, as some researchers have suggested. 'Instead, neurons in a small brain area remember how the whole word looks - using what could be called a visual dictionary.' The small area in the brain called the visual word form area is found in the left side of the visual cortex, opposite the fusiform face area on the right side, which remembers how faces look. The study published in the Journal of Neuroscience looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words. For the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), before and after participants learnt the new words. Using the fMRI-rapid adaptation, the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words. Before learning the words, neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words. However over time, the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words. The researchers said this shows the brain is 'holistically tuned' to recognise complete words, and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities. Dr Riesenhuber added: 'One area is selective for a whole face, allowing us to quickly recognise people, and the other is selective for a whole word, which helps us read quickly.' The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words. For the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Images of the brain were taken before and after participants learnt the new words. From this, the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the 'nonsense' words. Before learning the words, neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words. But over time, the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words. Co-author Dr Laurie Glezer said: 'This study is the first of its kind to show how neurons change their tuning with learning words, demonstrating the brain's plasticity.' The researchers said the study shows how the brain processes words, but may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities. Dr Riesenhuber said: 'For people who cannot learn words by phonetically spelling them out - which is the usual method for teaching reading - learning the whole word as a visual object may be a good strategy.' In particular, the team found the visual word form area in the fusiform gyrus (shown in purple) changed as the participants learned the 'nonsense' words. The neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense, but over time, these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words. Following a previous study carried out by the team published in 2009, the researchers were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties, all saying that learning word as visual objects had helped a great deal. That study showed the existence of a neural representation for whole written real words - also known as an orthographic lexicon. The latest research now shows how novel words can become incorporated after learning into this lexicon. Dr Riesenhuber said: 'The visual word form area does not care how the word sounds, just how the letters of the word look together. 'The fact that this kind of learning only happens in one very small part of the brain is a nice example of selective plasticity in the brain.'", "abstract": "A new study has found that when we learn how to write, our brain remembers how the word appears as a whole, rather than the individual lettering of words.

The 21-year-old broke an error-prone Vandeweghe once in the opening set and twice in the second to complete a one-sided victory in just over an hour on the showpiece stadium court at a sun-bathed Indian Wells. Bouchard, who reached the last four in Australia and France as well as the Wimbledon final in 2014, hit 13 winners against her hard-hitting opponent and appropriately ended the match with a crunching forehand winner down the line. Eugenie Bouchard  demolished Coco Vandeweghe 6-3, 6-2 in the third round of the BNP Paribas Open. The Canadian was no match for her opponent as she cruised through in just over an hour. 'I felt very solid today, and I think that's important against a player who can have big weapons,' the Canadian world No 7 said. 'I kind of told myself to be ready for anything. 'She had some great serves and some great forehands. I was just ready for that. I was going to try and neutralise that and take my chances when I had them. So I'm happy I was able to step in and attack whenever she let up a little bit. 'My serve was a bit more consistent today. I'm always working to try and get it better. It definitely gives me confidence knowing that I was holding serve pretty easily.' Bouchard, who celebrated her 21st birthday last month, will next face Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tsurenko. Big-hiitting Ameican Vandeweghe's erratic game was littered with 24 mistakes. Though Bouchard made 16 unforced errors, most of them with aggressive forehands that flew long, Vandeweghe's much more erratic game was littered with 24 mistakes. The big-serving American, who blasted three aces at close to 120mph, was broken in the eighth game of the match, and again in the third and fifth games of the second set as she repeatedly blasted groundstrokes beyond the baseline. Bouchard, who celebrated her 21st birthday last month, will next face Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tsurenko, who beat Frenchwoman Alize Cornet 7-5, 1-6, 6-2 on Monday after upsetting ninth-seeded German Andrea Petkovic in the previous round.", "abstract": "Eugenie Bouchard defeated Coco Vandeweghe 6-3, 6-2 in the third round of the BNP Paribas Open.

{"article": "A Sydney hospital employee who alleged a colleague sexually harassed her with repeated references to his 'anaconda' has had her claim dismissed. But the claim has shone a light on a culture of vexatious complaints and counter-complaints among health staff. Melanie Nacu, a sterilising technician at St Vincent's Private Hospital, told the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal that another technician approached her at work in February 2013 and told her: 'My anaconda, it's really big and alive'. A sterilising at St Vincent's Private Hospital claimed another technician approached her and repeatedly sexually harassed her. Ms Nacu told the tribunal she initially believed her colleague, Isagani Alano, was talking about a pet snake. She alleged that Mr Alano then pointed to his penis and said: 'This one'. On another occasion he discussed his penis with her and offered to show it to her. She also said Mr Alano frequently slapped her on the back despite her requests that he stop. In a decision handed down on Tuesday, the tribunal rejected Ms Nacu's version of events, noting that if the harassment had occurred it would likely have come to the attention of her supervisors. 'The charge of repeated sexual harassment in the workplace is a very serious allegation which must be decided in that light,' the tribunal stated. 'In the face of the respondent's denials and the absence of any evidence... we are not satisfied that the applicant has proved her allegations on the balance of probabilities.' The man allegedly pointed to his penis and said:'my anaconda, it's really big and alive' One witness - Vincent Cox, who was a nursing manager of Sterilising Services at the time of the alleged harassment - testified to a 'culture of vexatious complaints' within the department. '(Mr Cox) pointed out that they were not all made by the applicant,' the tribunal's judgment read. Other staff members made complaints which were dismissed. He could not recall whether he became concerned at the level of complaints. Under questioning, Ms Nacu agreed that other staff members had successfully made complaints about her, including about her swearing at colleagues, and that her counter-complaints had been dismissed on several occasions.", "abstract": "A sterilizing technician at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Sydney claimed that a colleague sexually harassed her by repeatedly referring to his 'anaconda', but her claim was dismissed by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

{"article": "Professor Michael Kelly, pictured, was one of 43 Fellows of the Royal Society who wrote to the president to warn that it was in danger of violating its founding principle. Five years ago, I was one of 43 Fellows of the Royal Society \u2013 the first and arguably still the most prestigious scientific organisation in the world \u2013 who wrote to our then-president about its approach to climate change. We warned that the Society was in danger of violating its founding principle, summed up in its famous motto \u2018Nullius in verba\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018Don\u2019t take another\u2019s word for it; check it out for yourself\u2019. The reason for our warning was a Society document which stated breezily: \u2018If you don\u2019t believe in climate change you are using one of the following [eight] misleading arguments.\u2019 The implication was clear: the Society seemed to be saying there was no longer room for meaningful debate about the claim that the world is warming dangerously because of human activity, because the science behind this was \u2018settled\u2019. We hoped we would persuade the Society to rethink this position. That document was revised so that the uncertainty involved in trying to model the climate was admitted. But since then the Society has become more, not less dogmatic \u2013 despite the fact that since we sent that letter, it has become evident that there is even more uncertainty than previously thought. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have continued to rise, but since 1998 there has been no statistically significant rise in global temperatures at all. This flies in the face of the confident predictions made by nearly all the climate computer models that the temperature would continue to rise as it did from 1975 to 1998. More than 60 different explanations have been proposed to explain why this \u2018pause\u2019 or \u2018hiatus\u2019 has happened, and their sheer number is the clearest evidence that the system that climate scientists are seeking to model is irreducibly complex. Human-sourced carbon dioxide is at best one of many factors in causing climate change, and humility in front of this complexity is the appropriate stance. Yet the Society continues to produce a stream of reports which reveal little sign of this. The latest example is the pre-Christmas booklet A Short Guide To Climate Science. Last year also saw the joint publication with the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of Climate Change: Evidence And Causes, and a report called Resilience. Through these documents, the Society has lent its name to claims \u2013 such as trends towards increasing extreme weather and climate casualties \u2013 that simply do not match real-world facts. Both the joint report with the NAS and the Short Guide answer 20 questions on temperatures, sea-level rises and ocean acidification. But a report today by the academic council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which includes several Society Fellows and other eminent scientists, states the Society has \u2018left out\u2019 parts of the science, so the answers to many of the questions ought to be different. I have personal experience of this selectivity. Last year, at the request of the president, I produced a paper that urged the Society\u2019s council to distance itself from the levels of certainty being expressed about future warming. I said it ought at least to have a \u2018plan B\u2019 if the pause should last much longer, so calling the models into still more serious question. I got a polite brush-off. Prof Kelly said the Royal Society, pictured, \u00a0was founded on the principle\u00a0\u2018Nullius in verba\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018Don\u2019t take another\u2019s word for it; check it out for yourself' Professor Kelly fears the Royal Society has become more dogmatic when considering climate change. The great 20th Century physicist, Richard Feynman, wrote in his autobiography: \u2018Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can \u2013 if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong \u2013 to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it.\u2019 This the Royal Society has failed to do. The reason for this lack of nuance seems to be that policymakers say they want \u2018scientific certainty\u2019. As an engineer, I find that amazing: we remain legally liable for what we say professionally, so will always qualify our statements. But the misleading lack of qualification in the statements made by the Royal Society and others is creating policy nonsense. The Climate Change Act requires the UK to cut its CO2 emissions by 80 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050 \u2013 at mind-boggling cost. Generating electricity from windmills has contributed to electricity prices increasing by twice the level of inflation over the last decade, with further huge rises to fund renewable energy to come. Aluminium production is highly sensitive to energy prices, and most of the UK", "abstract": "The Royal Society, the world's most prestigious scientific organisation, has been accused of becoming dogmatic in its approach to climate change.

The company is a leading manufacturer of both unmanned aircraft, military radars and surveillance systems. Speaking anonymously, the American official would not say whether it was shot down deliberately but the Pentagon is trying to determine why operators lost control of the drone.

Saturday is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653. Pi day!: Students from the Maurice J. Tobin School makes a human Pi symbol at the school in Boston during a celebration of Pi Day in 2007. The best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds, morning and evening. The next time that happens is in March 2115. 'It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics,' said University of California Berkeley mathematician and author Edward Frenkel. 'Pi is special.' Pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics. It 'is kind of a basic atomic building block\" for math, said Temple University mathematician and author John Paulos, who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m. In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie. eat your numbers: To celebrate Pi day (the math constant and March 14 or 3-14), Wanda's Pie in the Sky, owned by Wanda Beaver made these pies in 2011. 'It's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm,' said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University math professor, who called it a time for people to'remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school.' Kaplan acknowledged that most people don't really recall math as fun, blaming that on how it's taught: 'There's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world.' One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns. Yet in 1897, a bill before the Indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2. It fell flat. 'We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time,' Frenkel said. 'How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?'

The wall Street Journal reports that Dana Emanuel and Byron Clarke decided to hold their wedding on the special day. The date won't come around again for 100 years, so the couple decided \u00a0to send circular wedding invitations to  family and friends. The nuptials are even in unison which their engagement date on June 28 last year \u2014 6.28, or two pi. 'The guests are really getting into and are able to laugh about it,' said Clarke. 'It kind of plays into our personalities and humor will hopefully be a big part of the day.'

The arch comments will be seen as the latest stage in Mr Farron\u2019s undeclared bid for leadership of the party should it suffer a catastrophe on 7 May. The Lib Dems won 57 seats at the 2010 election, meaning that when they went into Coalition with the Conservatives, they were able to argue for five Cabinet places. But the polls are so bad now \u2013 one even put the Lib Dems on 5 per cent \u2013 that the party is projected to lose half his seats in May. Some even expect Mr Clegg to lose his Sheffield Hallam seat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Farron said the Lib Dems should \u2018actively consider\u2019 something short of a full coalition if the general election results in a hung parliament. He told the paper that he believed the party would hang on to well over half of the 57 seats they won in 2010. But he said he was already preparing to pick up the pieces. \u2018What I\u2019m absolutely ready for \u2014 you may as well be excited by it \u2014 is the thrill of rebuilding,\u2019 he said. If Mr Clegg goes after the election, Mr Farron is seen as the front-runner to succeed him. Potential rivals such as Vince Cable, the business secretary, care minister Norman Lamb, and Ed Davey, the energy secretary, are seen as less likely to win.

While he said the party deserves \u2018eight out of 10\u2019 for the way it handled the coalition negotiations in 2010, he suggested that Mr Clegg should have been more robust with the Tories in government. \u2018You\u2019re not going to bring the government down on something like the NHS reforms if you say no, it\u2019s not happening,\u2019 he said. Mr Farron gave the party a score of just \u2018two out of 10\u2019 for how it had handled its time in coalition.

His cousin Logan Crespan told DailyMail.com: 'He said he was going to the beach when he left the party but the closest beach was 15 miles away.' Eloi's mother, Wendy Margolin, said that at around 2.20am her son called a friend, Aurora, Cardenas, and told her he was'screwed' and that he did not know where he was. 'He pretty much said, \"I need you to come over here, I need help.\" I asked him, \"Where are you?\" and he told me that he was in LA and that he didn\u2019t know where he was at and that he was lost,' Cardenas told NBC Bay Area. 'The second time he called it just clicked. I didn\u2019t know if his phone died, or if he hung up.' Addressing the media Sunday, Ms Margolin said her son is very responsible and dedicated to his studies, and that it was it out of character for him not to contact his family and friends. The 19-year-old's parents drove to Los Angeles from Northern California Saturday to join the search for their son. Margolin was planning to scour doughnut and candy shops that are open late in the area of the frat house. Last contact: Wendy Margolin (left), Eloi's mother, said a friend of her son's, Aurora Cardenas (right), got a call from him at around 2.20am Saturday telling her he was'screwed' and lost. Meanwhile, his friends have been visiting lifeguard towers in Santa Monica and Venice Beach. A missing poster describes Vasquez as a six-foot, 175lb Hispanic man with dark hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a white and red t-shirt, white plimsolls, and gray chinos at the party on the  600 block of W 28th Street, a fraternity hub known locally as 'Greek Row'. Vasquez is not a member of a fraternity. Relatives told police he did not have any money or identification with him at the time. He did have a cell phone on him, but it appears to have died. Cal Athletics released a statement Sunday addressing Vasquez's disappearance. 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,' the press release said.

Above, two of the suspects, currently jailed: Jeremiah Gaver, 28 (left), and Nathaniel Gaver, 27 (right) Fighting cops: Police say the shootout was sparked by one of the Gavers pushing a Walmart store employee while trying to use the building's restroom. Above, suspects Ruth and Peter Gaver, 52 and 55. Fatal: One member of the Gaver family was killed in the shootout, now identified as Enoch Gaver. When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS. On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized. The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked Saturday when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. The shots killed Enoch Gaver and injured relative David Gaver and Sgt Jeremy Daniels. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle.

{"article": "In his autobiography published late last year, Andrew Cuomo described himself as the victim in his bitter divorce from Kerry Kennedy - saying he learned about the break-up from a reporter who called him for comment. But a new biography of the New York governor says he had a larger part in the unraveling of the marriage, which briefly united two political dynasties. Vanity Fair's Michael Shnayerson alleges in 'The Contender' that the couple started talking 'not if but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. However, Cuomo dragged out the break-up for years - possibly to use his wife's political clout to fuel his failed 2002 gubernatorial run, the book alleges. Doomed: A new biography of  Andrew Cuomo details the bitter divorce between the current New York Governor and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F Kennedy. The former couple pictured above on their wedding day in 1990. The New York Daily News, which previewed the book, cited Shnayerson's sources who said the couple learned they were incompatible fairly early on in their relationship. Shnayerson did not interview Cuomo himself. Shnayerson quotes a Douglas Kennedy - Kerry's 46-year-old younger brother - \u00a0who says that while Cuomo treasured the connection to the Kennedy family, he loathed participating in reunions at the family's estate in Hyannis, Massachusetts and eventually stopped going altogether. Douglas Kennedy said on one occasion, when the Kennedys spent a night partying and singing, Cuomo stood by 'looking disgusted'.\u00a0Douglas also described Cuomo as a 'bully' who thought many member's of his wife's family as weak or 'political'. Not if, but when: Author Michael Shnayerson says in 'The Contender' that Cuomo and Kennedy started talking not if 'but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. The couple pictured above with twins Cara Ethel and Mariah Matila, with father Andrew holding baby Michaela. Staying together for the campaign: Kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor. According to the book, the couple agreed to break-up after the campaign, but Cuomo kept putting it off. The Contender, written by Vanity Fair writer Michael Shnayerson, is due out March 31. Perhaps one of the most painful digs at the Kennedy family was the Manhattan party that acted as the informal launch for Cuomo's 2002 campaign for governor. At the party, the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil' was played at high-volume - a song which deals with the assassinations of both President John F Kennedy and Kerry father's Robert F Kennedy. The Kennedy's who were in the room for the party were aghast, but it's unclear if Cuomo was behind the decision to play the song. Disdain for the in-laws wasn't the only issue between the political couple. Kerry Kennedy and Cuomo harbored ill-feelings about the little things too, the book claims. When she first started dating Cuomo, Kennedy allegedly 'rolled her eyes a bit' when she saw the plastic covers he kept on his furniture. And a friend close to one side of the former couple told Shnayerson that Cuomo wasn't dazzled by his wife's cooking, cleaning or even the 'dowdy' way she dressed. By the time Cuomo started planning his 2002 run for governor, his wife agreed to stay with him through the campaign. But when the campaign failed, Cuomo allegedly asked her to stay together for just a little longer. The breaking point for Kennedy, according to Shnayerson, came when Cuomo confronted her for having an extra-marital affair with polo player Bruce Colley. A 'closer observer' told Shnayerson that Kennedy told Cuomo to mind his own business, break the news to the kids and move out of their home. 'After 13 years of marriage, and truly stressful times, I knew the ties that bound us together had frayed,' Cuomo wrote in his autobiography All Things Possible, published late last year. 'But I had hoped we could work through what I saw was a difficult time, not an end. Obviously, I was in denial.' 'Even though Kerry had told me she wanted a divorce I thought I could fix it, I couldn\u2019t accept it \u2014 it only became real when a reporter called and said she filed the papers.' Breaking point: The couple officially divorced in 2005. Cuomo eventually won the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee.

The couple started talking about divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter in 1997, but Kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor."}

Scroll down for video. Roaring success: James Corden's debut on The Late Late Show with Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks. \u2018James has shown that he\u2019s funny, can sing and dance, puts celebrities at their ease, and doesn\u2019t dismiss stars with snark. \u2018If he maintains this trajectory, he could find himself hosting the Globes \u2013 and that would really cement his position in Hollywood.\u2019 Corden, 36, who made his name as co-writer and star of cult television sitcom Gavin and Stacey, has already proved his ability to host a major awards show by fronting the Brits for four years. If he took on the Globes, he would be following in the footsteps of fellow comedy actor Ricky Gervais, who hosted the ceremony from 2010 to 2012. Since Gervais stepped down, the awards have been co-hosted by American TV comedy stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

Celebrities lined up for future shows include X Factor tycoon Simon Cowell, footballer David Beckham, chef Gordon Ramsay and actors Michael Douglas, Courteney Cox and Claire Danes. But not everyone might welcome Corden as the Globes host.

The 37-year-old is due to retire from the 50-over game following the World Cup, but proved on Wednesday that he is still an elite performer at the top level with his 124 against Scotland following on from tons against Australia, England and Bangladesh. Sangakkara's sublime knock helped his side hammer the minnows by 148 runs. He was instrumental in making 363-9 before the Scots were bowled out for 215. Kumar Sangakkara celebrates after scoring a century for the fourth consecutive World Cup game. Sangakkara hit\u00a0124 from 95 balls against Scotland, the highest innings of the tournament so far. Freddie Coleman offered some resistance for Scotland but they were eventually soundly beaten. Calum MacLeod was bowled all ends up as Scotland could only muster 215 in response to Sri Lanka. Next week's quarter-final could therefore be his final ODI outing but, despite his prolific form, Sangakkara insists he will not play on after the tournament Down Under. 'It is never about whether you can play or not,' he told the BBC's Test Match Special. 'Retirement is not about form, it is about time and place and whether it feels right.' The wicketkeeper admitted in the post-match presentations following the 148-run win against the Scots that his body was finding it harder and harder to cope with the demands of modern cricket. 'It becomes hard, of course, now that I'm 37,' he said. 'I get a bit slower, the joints start creaking and aching. 'I'm pretty happy that I'm still playing, I consider myself pretty lucky to be part of such a good side. 'When everything is going well, things look bright.' Sangakkara has scored 14,189 runs in 403 one-day internationals, adding 12,203 in 130 Test matches in a near 15-year international career. After beginning steadily, Sangakkara accelerated as Scotland struggled to contain him. He cleared the ropes four times and added 13 fours, reaching his ton with a prod through third man. He eventually fell edging Josh Davey to wicket-keeper Matthew Cross. Angelo Mathews plundered 51 from 21 balls down the innings, including sixes from each of the four deliveries he faced immediately before being dismissed when going for another maximum - caught just inside the ropes by Freddie Coleman off the final ball of Matt Machan's costly fourth and final over. The 37-year-old also hit 100 against Bangladesh, Australia and England earlier in the tournament.

The girl's mother is suing her travel agency in China over the attack, which occurred during a six-day trip to Thailand that was a reward for the girl's good grades in school. Chen Ting, 36, said daughter Chen Yin had seemed unusually quiet during the trip, and on the final day as they waited at the airport before flying home, the girl began crying and complaining that her arm and stomach were hurting. Injury: The girl's mother holds up a picture of the alleged bitemark on her daughter's arm. Mrs Chen then found bite marks on her daughter, and discovered that Chinese tour guide Zhou Fang was allegedly responsible. 'At the time I clearly saw some teeth marks on my daughter's left arm, the skin in the area was abraded, the same with her belly,' she told People's Daily Online. When Ms Chen complained to the guide, she claimed he refused to apologise and simply walked away. Once she returned to China she complained to the travel agency, and an investigation in Thailand allegedly found that another tourist saw the the guide ask the little girl for a kiss. In her complaint letter, the mother said: 'When I saw my daughter in tears and listened to her story, I checked and found obvious bite marks in places where she couldn't have done it herself. 'She said the guide had bitten her after telling her: \"You are very pretty. You're leaving soon and it's hard to see you go. Come here and let me give you a kiss\".' When she refused, he had grabbed her anyway and then bit her on the stomach. She managed to break free and run behind some luggage where he grabbed her again, and this time bit her on the arm. The girl's mother has had her daughter tested in case she was infected with any diseases by the bites. Other passengers questioned in the investigation confirmed that they had often seen the guide pestering little girl when he thought her mother was not looking. She added: 'I was particularly worried that he might have some disease and my kid would be infected. 'My child is introvert. She has hidden in her bed and cried [because of the bites].' She added that the girl even said she regretted getting good grades at school \u2013 because without them she would not have gone on the trip and met the man. The daughter also mentioned she 'never wanted to travel with groups anymore.'

The Liverpool striker talks about his upbringing, his club team-mates and why he doesn't blame Roy Hodgson for his five-month injury lay-off. Daniel Sturridge describes himself as a'very closed-off person' but here in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail he opens up about his life on-and-off the field. As the Reds prepare for Monday's Premier League trip to Swansea, the 25-year-old striker talks about his upbringing, his club team-mates and why he doesn't blame Roy Hodgson for his five-month injury lay-off. Here,\u00a0Sportsmail gathers the best 10 quotes from our Sturridge interview. Daniel Sturridge tells Sportsmail his thoughts on Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard and his injury problems. Sturridge on Mario Balotelli. 'In football you meet people who are cool guys and he is one of those guys. He is a young guy who just wants to live his life. Anyone at the age of 24, if you put a microscope on them for a few months and see how they are living, it would probably be far worse than Mario. He is a normal guy. Footballers are put on a pedestal of not being human but we are just normal people. I am a normal dude.' Mario Balotelli (left) has been described as a 'cool guy' by Sturridge, despite a difficult start at his new club. Sturridge on Steven Gerrard. 'This guy is a living legend. Words can't describe what he has done not just for the club but for the players as well. He helps players settle in, young players. He takes them under his wing. We will never be able to repay him for that. His stature and his demeanour will be very difficult to replace but we have to. It will take time. That guy will always be a legend in my eyes. I am in awe of him now.' Sturridge (right) has hailed departing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) as a 'living legend' of the club. Sturridge on strikers. 'Why am I watching someone else's glories and achievements? It doesn't matter to me who comes around or what players are about. It means nothing to me. When you watch other people, you don't get anywhere in life because you are at war with yourself. Well done to Harry Kane and what he has achieved, but I am not watching what he is doing. I just believe in me.' Harry Kane has had a scintillating  season at Tottenham scoring 26 goals in all competitions so far. Sturridge on England injury. 'Regardless of what happened in the past, I love playing for England,\u2019 says Sturridge. \u2018That situation occurred and it\u2019s in the past. I don\u2019t want to dwell on it. People pick injuries up and they are unfortunate. It just so happened I got injured that day. It\u2019s life. People get injured sometimes. It is what it is.' Sturridge's five-month injury lay-off began when he damaged thigh muscles while on England duty last year. Sturridge on Roy Hodgson. \u2018My relationship with the England manager is top class. No worries at all. We speak via text. We speak to each other. We keep in touch. Throughout my injury, he kept in touch. I would never blame him for this. Never. Or any of the staff - it was just an unfortunate incident. I have got so much respect and admiration for him and his set-up. The relationship is very, very good.' Despite the injury, Sturridge (right) says his relationship with England manager Roy Hodgson as 'top class' Sturridge on his personal life. 'I'm a very closed-off person,' says Sturridge. 'I can count my friends on one hand. Everyone has acquaintances, workmates and so on, but apart from that, I just have my family and a close-knit group of people around me. 'Why closed-off? I think it is down to childhood. When you grow up in certain environments, you can't be too loud or too open because you can be exposed to things you don't want to be exposed to. Where I grew up there was crime and there were other things.' Despite his extrovert celebration, the 25-year-old striker describes himself as a'very closed-off person' Sturridge on Birmingham gang culture. 'There was a gang culture when I was growing up in Birmingham. It was easy to stay away from it because the football was there but that\u2019s the reason why I have never been open. 'It becomes second nature to be like that. I had to be wary. At all times. 'The gang stuff wasn\u2019t based on colours - it was more about areas. You might be a family friend of someone who was involved with something.", "abstract": "In an interview with Sportsmail, Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge talks about his life on and off the field, including his upbringing, his club teammates, and his injury problems.

The UEFA president, who was on the pitch for Juventus at the European Cup final in Brussels 30 years ago when 39 people - mainly from the Italian club - died after rioting Liverpool fans charged Juve supporters causing a wall to collapse. Platini has called for tougher stadium bans and a European-wide sports police force. Speaking at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, Platini said: 'Europe is seeing a rise in nationalism and extremism the like of which we have not witnessed for a very long time. Michel Platini wants to see a European sports police force introduced to prevent football hooliganism. 'This insidious trend can also be observed in our stadiums, as football is a reflection of society. Given its popularity, our sport is a barometer for the ills of our continent. And that barometer is pointing to some worrying developments. 'I therefore renew my call for greater awareness of this issue among the public authorities, so that we can avoid reliving the dark days of a not-so-distant past - a past where hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots in certain European stadiums. 'In recent months, we have all been struck by certain images that I thought were a thing of the past. Some of us experienced that past at first hand. In my case, it was exactly 30 years ago... Nobody wants a repeat of such events. The Heysel disaster took place in 1985 during European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool. 39 fans were killed when they were crushed to death when Liverpool fans breached the neutral area. Most of the fatalities were Juventus fans and Platini wants to avoid any future incidents like this. 'We need tougher stadium bans at European level and - I will say it again - the creation of a European sports police force.' Platini also appeared to have a veiled dig at Sepp Blatter for deciding to run for a fifth term as FIFA president despite having said at the UEFA Congress four years ago that his fourth term would be his last. Blatter then described himself as the 'captain of the ship in troubled waters bringing in back on the right route'. The Italian, who is himself being re-elected unopposed for a third term, told UEFA delegates: 'I regard myself as a simple team-mate - at most your captain. But not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm.' Dynamo Kiev fans clash with riot police during mass fighting in the Olympiyski Stadium in the Europa League.

Platini's printed speech included the words 'clinging to the helm for dear life' but he dropped that line when he delivered the speech, saying only: 'No. I am simply the captain of a winning team - one that wins because it boasts 54 talented presidents and general secretaries who are prepared to play for each other.' In his speech to the Congress on Tuesday, Blatter made no reference to standing again for FIFA president but once again urged football to resist calls to boycott to the 2018 World Cup in Russia due to its involvement in the civil war in Ukraine. Blatter said: 'Football shall be united, sport shall be united when it comes to boycotts because boycott has never given any results. We have to pay attention to political interference's.

{"article": "This is the moment a pair of skydivers dramatically set fire to their petrol-soaked parachute canopies sending them plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour. Alex Aimard and his friend Petter Jonsson leapt from a plane over Eloy in Arizona armed with a parachute doused in kerosene, a flare gun and a Go Pro camera. And after deploying their parachutes, the pair then pull out the guns during their descent to set fire to their canopies. Alex Aimard aims his flare gun at his petrol-soaked parachute after jumping out of a plane over the Arizona. The fire from the gun causes the parachute to ignite and causes a blaze in the Mr Aimard's canopy. With just seconds to react and release the now flaming parachutes before the fire travelled down cords to their bodies, the pair free themselves. But luckily they also have an emergency parachute, meaning they then glide safely to the ground. The pair, who are both experienced professional skydivers and BASE jumpers, had meticulously planned the dangerous stunt, which took place earlier this year. Mr Jonsson, from Sweden, said: 'I was so focused on my task that I didn't have time to be scared or think about what could have gone wrong.' The fire then takes hold and starts to travel down the cords to their bodies meaning Mr Aimard has to quickly free themselves. After being freed, Mr Aimard then deploys his emergency parachute so he can glide safely back to the ground. While Mr Aimard, from France, added: 'Petter jumped first so when I exited the plane I saw something that I will never forget - a big cloud of smoke made by the explosion of his chute. 'It was like being part of a Rambo movie for real.' The duo had been taking part in a two-week online project called Living the Dream, when they travelled to Utah and Arizona to perform the sky dives. The potentially deadly fire stunt took place on the last day of their trip. Mr Aimard explained: 'We struggled with the weather conditions and the project was on hold for a few days due to a strong wind, which gave us plenty of time for preparation. 'When the wind finally slowed down, everything happened in a couple of hours. Petter Jonsson then attempts the stunt and shoots the kerosene soaked parachute with the flare gun. With the parachute in flames, \u00a0Mr Jonsson then starts plummeting to earth at more than 120mph. But despite the dangerous stunt Mr Jonsson makes it safely back down to the ground thanks to his emergency parachute. 'Skydiving itself is not without danger and flying in a plane with two big buckets full of gas and two flare guns doesn't decrease the risk. 'You can imagine a lot of things going wrong but with fine tuned preparation there was no room for doubt or uncontrolled fear.' But despite the stunt receiving praise from fellow skydiving professionals, there was some online criticism. But Mr Aimard explained: 'Globally the response was very positive, but we got a couple of messages complaining about the pollution and how immature it was to do that. 'And I kind of agree, I guess this is why it was so much fun.'", "abstract": "Two experienced skydivers, Alex Aimard and Petter Jonsson, set fire to their petrol-soaked parachute canopies during a dangerous stunt in Arizona.

{"article": "They were worlds apart in life. Heath Ledger, a Hollywood actor. Simon Millington, a qualified auto-electrician and the son of duck farmers from country Victoria. But both men, the doting fathers of little girls, died just years apart from the same phenomenon - the abuse of prescription drugs, described as an epidemic in Australia by anti-drug abuse groups. Now Kim Ledger, the late Academy Award winner's father, has joined an effort to fight prescription drug abuse after he was moved by a 'heartwrenching' letter from Simon's mother, Margaret. The letter said Simon 'wanted to stay well for Maddie', his young daughter, 'but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back up again' and he died of a pain medication overdose in 2010. 'His life mattered,' Margaret wrote, 'and that is why I do what I do for others in similar circumstances.' Scroll down for video. Rest in peace: Heath Ledger, pictured, died after consuming six pharmaceutical medications in August 2008. 'His life mattered': Simon Millington, pictured here with his young daughter Maddie, died in 2010 after a sixteen year fight with prescription drugs which he became addicted to after being caught in a car accident in August 1994. Accomplished actor: Heath Ledger 'immersed' himself in the role of the Joker, his father has said, in preparation for his role in The Dark Knight (pictured). He was posthumously awarded an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor after the performance and his death. Kim Ledger, Heath's father, has been involved in efforts to increase awareness about the dangers of prescription drug abuse since his son's death in August 2008. His latest position is as Patron of the not-for-profit Scriptwise. Mr Ledger's own son accidentally died around two years earlier after he consumed a lethal cocktail of six prescription medications. The 28-year-old actor was found dead in his Manhattan apartment, shortly after completing filming for The Dark Knight, where he starred as The Joker. 'He was just desperately trying to get to sleep,' Mr Ledger said. After receiving the emotional letter from Margaret and John Millington from Nhill, Victoria, and hosting a follow-up meeting with them last year, Mr Ledger today announced he will be the patron of the new not-for-profit Scriptwise, which will raise awareness about the dangers and solutions to prescription drug abuse. 'I met Margaret and John Millington last year... Margaret had reached out to me about maybe a year earlier or so with a little note, a letter really, a lovely letter that was quite compelling,' he said. 'It was explaining what they had to go through (with Simon). It was really quite heartwrenching.' In a statement, Mr Ledger said his son's profile was probably 'a little higher than many other loved ones' who had experienced tragic deaths from prescription drug abuse. 'If something positive can come from (Heath's) passing such as raising awareness of the problem and moving towards some form of live monitoring for prescription medication, then my job is done.' Margaret and John have lobbied the government in favour of measures to crack down on prescription drug abuse since Simon's death. Simon had grappled with an addiction to pain medication for some sixteen years, Mrs Millington told Daily Mail Australia, following a devastating car accident in August 1994, when he was just 18-years-old. Heath Ledger was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the film The Dark Knight, following his stellar performance. Simon Millington was caught in a car accident in 1994. As a result of his accident and his recovery, Mr Millington became addicted to pain killers and other medications, including 'benzos and opiates', his mother said. Mr Ledger said: 'They've done a great job - others around them have too - but those people who were the ones who influenced me enough to get involved in the project.' Mrs Millington told Daily Mail Australia she was touched by the praise from Mr Ledger. 'We caught up with him in Perth late last year,' Mrs Millington said. 'We've spent a lot of time sharing our stories about our sons... 'There's often times only the people who have been through it understand what we've been going through.' Heath Ledger died of an overdose in August 2008 after consuming a lethal cocktail of six different prescription medications. Mr and Mrs Millington have worked hard to raise awareness about prescription drug abuse in regional Victoria. They are lobbying for a mandatory national Real Time Monitoring System to help stem the epidemic. Scriptwise said pharmaceutical drugs were linked to 82 per cent of overdose deaths in Victoria in 2013 alone. For the past three years I have been a volunteer on the Wimmera Drug Action Task Force, the subcommittee I am on is the 'Problematic Use & Misuse of Prescription Medications' (see terms of reference attached).

{"article": "A Ohio grandmother will spend the rest of her life in jail after being found guilty of the rape of her own grandchildren. Edwina Louis, 53, will spend the rest of her life behind bars after she was sentenced to four consecutive life terms without parole. The judge in the case, William T. Marshall, said in all his 19 years experience on the bench, he had never seen anyone more evil. The jury also had no doubt of her guilt, convicting after less than six hours of deliberation. Jailed: A jury spent less than six hours deliberating whether Edwina Louis raped, tortured and abused her four grandchildren who were all under-12. The three girls and one boy spoke of how they were staved and beaten. Along with four counts of rape, she was also found guilty of a number of other serious charges including child endangerment and kidnapping. 'This woman, who never shed a tear or showed even an ounce of remorse, will never get out of prison,' Scioto County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Pat Apel said. 'That's the right thing.' The trial took almost a week as stories of rape, torture and abuse of the three girls and one boy were laid bare before the courtroom. The children described being tied up for long periods of time, even weeks, being untied only long enough to attend online classes and to go to the bathroom. They said they were rarely fed and medical authorities told the court they were underweight. The fridge and the freezer in the house had locks on them with only the adults wearing the keys around their necks. Monster: Edwina Louis of Wheelersburg, Ohio, will never be a free woman. She was found guilty of abusing her four grandchildren, tying them to their beds with ropes and chains and beating them with belts and paddles. Both girls said they were made to stand against the wall with their arms outstretched for hours and if they let their hands down they were beaten and slapped. Along with the stories images of the kids scarred and skinny bodies were presented for the jury to view. Suspicions were aroused after a nine-year-old girl sent a message to her teacher that she and her brothers and sisters were being beaten and had been tied up. The teacher immediately called the police along with child protective services. When police arrived those in the house scrambled to cut the ropes from the children and threw the chains into a plastic bag and then into a garbage can. All four children who were under 12 were removed from the house by emergency court order six days later. Edwin Louis, and the children's biological mother, Bobbi Sue Pack along with her boyfriend Juan Sanchez, were all arrested several days later. Pack and Sanchez have faced the same charges and have now been sentenced to 10 years to life and 25 years to life, respectively. Authorities had their suspicions that the children were being mistreated for years however complaints were never followup with any home visits. Brutal: Juan Carlos Sanchez was given a 25 year sentence after pleading guilty to rape and child abuse of his girlfriend\u2019s  children, who  were kept chained to their beds and starved in the family\u2019s Ohio home. Depraved:\u00a0Bobbi Sue Pack, the four children's biological mother plead guilty to abusing children. Police found out about the children\u2019s horrifying living conditions after they emailed a teacher at their online school. On at least four separate occasions throughout much of 2012 and early 2013, complaints were made to Children Services. On one occasion there was evidence of bruises and scratches on the children's bodies. Another time, the kids said that they had been kept locked up without food. Other complaints of physical and emotional abuse were also made including savage beatings with a belt. Time and again, Children Services of Scioto County failed to follow up the calls and make the necessary checks. When the children first were interviewed by detectives, they were unsocial, terrified and the two middle children could barely speak. When the children were finally questioned, the only boy in the group of four was \u00a0violent and angry. For weeks he would only say 'I hate you!' to anyone who came near. During the trial, the two girls, now 10 and 12 testified from an adjacent room and told horror stories of being raped by Sanchez and being tied up in both ropes and chains and being beaten by Louis. The children are now with a new foster family who is able to give them the love and attention they require and deserve. 'If there is a bright spot in all of this, it is the transformation we have seen from the kids,' Apel said. 'Maybe now, they have a chance.'", "abstract": "Edwina Louis, a grandmother from Ohio, has been sentenced to four consecutive life terms without parole for raping and torturing her four grandchildren, who were all under 12.

{"article": "It is sometimes necessary for men wanting to attract the opposite sex to come out of their shell. Yet it seems that by often choosing the bolder males, women may be missing out on the best possible mate. Researchers have found that the shyest males actually have the most to offer a potential lover - at least in the world of hermit crabs. Hermit crabs, like the ones above, borrow the shells from other creatures to keep them safe and new research has shown that those crabs that stay in their shells more often tend to be a better mate for female crabs. Professor Mark Briffa, a marine animal behaviour researcher at Plymouth University, and his colleagues have found that the most timid crabs tend to more high quality sperm - making them a better option for females looking for a mate. This, they say, is because the crabs that spend more time hiding from the world inside their shells, also have invested the most resources in becoming reproductively fit. Males of a species of hairy chested crab, which has been given a nickname David Hasselhoff, spend their lives largely separate from the females, according to new research. In a study looking at the private life of the deep-sea crab known as the 'Hoff' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near Antarctica. This, according to the British research, is because of the conflicting demands of feeding and raising young among the sexes. In 2010, a British expedition revealed a 'lost world' of deep-sea animals including the crab named after the Baywatch star thriving on the ocean floor near Antarctica. Using a deep-diving remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to examine the distribution, size and sex of these crabs at the vents, Dr Leigh Marsh and colleagues from the University of Southampton have now pieced together their private lives. The researchers found that large male Hoff crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep-sea vents, closest to the hot fluids that jet from them. Smaller males tend to mingle with the females at the base of the mineral spires. It is an unusual approach in the animal kingdom, where the boldest, bravest and strongest usually win the right to mate. Indeed, in many species males have to prove their physical fitness with bold and dramatic displays - like in peacocks and birds of paradise - and even mortal combat in some cases. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Professor Briffa and his colleagues said: 'It appears that in hermit crabs, high-quality individuals that have invested heavily in reproduction, by making large spermatophores, are the most risk averse. 'Although we did not measure metabolic rate, a key process for the pace of life syndrome, this result seems counter to the idea that the most productive individuals should also be the boldest.' The researchers examined the 'personality' of 100 hermit crabs collected from Mount Batten and Hannafore Point in Plymouth. They did this by testing the'startle response' of each crab by removing it from its tank, inverting the crab for five seconds, which caused it to withdraw into its shell, and then returning it back into the tank upright. The boldest crabs would then poke their heads back out of their shells far faster than the more timid crabs. On average most crabs emerged within 16 seconds. The researchers then measured the levels of a protein called haemocyanin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen around the crabs bodies. They found crabs that stayed in their shells longer after being startled tended to have higher levels of this protein. Hermit crabs, like the one pictured above, hide in their shells when startled, but it also helps them become better mates. This is because when inside their shell, the crabs are unable to access the oxygen rich sea water around them and so higher levels of this protein helps use the oxygen already in their bodies more efficiently. Next the researchers examined the crustacean's gonads and measured the size of the tube shaped bundles of sperm there, called spermatophores. Again they found in the timid crabs, those that were slower to reemerge from their shells after being frightened, had larger spermatophores and so more high quality sperm stored. As they grow, hermit crabs like the one above, 'upgrade' their shells by seeking out larger ones as finding the right home can offer them protection from danger but also give them a way of growing better stores of sperm. Professor Briffa and his colleagues said that hiding in the shell when threatened may allow the crabs to conserve their energy for building up greater sperm reserves. It also reduces the risk of losing a shell in a fight with another crab, something that can increase the amount of stress a crab is exposed to. They said that in hermit crabs less reproductively fit individuals may develop boldness to help them compete with the shier more fertile crabs. They said: 'Low-quality males may emerge more quickly in an attempt to maximize their chance of mating, or", "abstract": "Shy male hermit crabs are better mates for females, according to research by Professor Mark Briffa and his colleagues at Plymouth University.

{"article": "Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers' Despite leaving the White House more than a month ago, official confirmation of the chief floral designer's unexpected departure has only just emerged. Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations for events such as official state dinners for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers'. Dowling 'was escorted from the building' on February 13, reports The Washington Post. In the wake of the Post's revelation and coming almost six weeks after Dowling's departure, the White House released a statement on Tuesday in which it praised her 'lively and colorful' creations, which reflected the 'historic rooms which they graced.' 'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements,' read a statement issued by Michelle Obama's office on Tuesday.

'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.' Within an hour of the first lady's official confirmation, Dowling also felt compelled to release a statement about her sudden departure weeks before. 'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' said Dowling in a statement issued by heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin. The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before. 'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' But Dowling's unexpected departure and the sudden release of two statements more than a month later has prompted speculation that all was not well between Dowling and the first lady. Several unnamed floral designers who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told the Post that Dowling left because her 'fussy style' wasn't in keeping with the first lady's desire for a modern and clean aesthetic. When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look,' but now that seems to have fallen out of favor at the White House. Just days before the florist's departure, the Old Family Dining Room had been re-opened after being refurbished by the First Lady to showcase modern art and design, according to the White House website. Dowling's predecessor, Nancy Clarke, had lasted through six presidential administrations. During her tenure as First Lady, Mrs Obama has taken a greater interest in gardening than most of her predecessors - but the focus has been herbs and vegetables rather than floral.

{"article": "(CNN)With majorities in both chambers of Congress, it is time for Republicans to begin rolling back six years of failed Obama administration policies. Our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the Obama administration. Regrettably, military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military adventurism. A strong, robust defense is seen not to deter aggression, but to provoke it. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt: our entitlement programs. As expected, almost four years after the passage of the Budget Control Act, virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs, while essential defense programs have been sacrificed. Political leaders in Washington need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government. Instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels, the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us, listing the programs and capabilities we'll need to protect our people and interests around the world, and then funding those efforts. Even though we've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade, the threats to Americans at home and abroad are growing.  From the rise of the Islamic State and the spread of Islamic terrorism, to Russia's aggression in Europe, to Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea, the threats to American security are growing. Yet, even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty, the United States has been steadily reducing our spending on defense. Even before sequestration, President Obama made defense cuts of $487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs. This was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration, which, when combined with Obama's prior cuts, will total $1 trillion over the coming decade. All of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership. The results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies. The slight increase in President Obama's proposed 2016 budget won't significantly change that. At the end of this process, our military will be significantly smaller, dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place. The Army is on the path to be reduced to pre-World War II levels. The Navy is at pre-WWI levels. And our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. Our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies. They have presented not just a crisis of readiness for America, but also a perilous strategic weakness. Our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence. History has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend, it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability, and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize. We think we are saving money, but in the long run, we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty. We can afford the military we need, but we must make it a priority. For this reason, we introduced an amendment to the Senate budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces. We believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by (former) Defense Secretary Robert Gates in his FY12 budget, the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats. It is the budget that the bipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel stated was \"the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing.\" Now that Republicans control both house of Congress, it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live, not the world the way we wish it was. Until now, our approach as a country and a party since the Budget Control Act has not been one of American strength. Continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness. We need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform.  In the end, it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade. As members of Congress, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions. Despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military, they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain. It's time", "abstract": "Republicans in Congress are calling for an increase in defense spending to reverse the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the Obama administration.

Not to play well and not win. \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing recently, and we\u2019ve got to stop that. We\u2019ve got to make sure the most important thing for Saturday is to gain a victory.

{"article": "Six months ago Kobane was a city in panic as the Kurds were desperately fleeing ISIS forces as they bared down on the border town, fearful that they would be slaughtered like the Yazidis before them if the settlement was overrun by the fanatical jihadis. Now the terrorists have gone, beaten back into the desert by Kurdish forces and coalition airstrikes, and the residents can return to their'saved' city. But, as these images show, not a lot of the home they remember is still standing. Tanks rust in the streets, buildings reduced to mere shells after bombings serve as temporary shelter for those who survived, while a little girl is reduced to lighting a fire underneath a piece of rubble in the street to keep warm. A sign which once proudly displayed the town's name now stands riddled with bullet holes, like the few buildings left standing around it. The battle for Kobane was the fiercest and most bloody battle of the war against ISIS to date, and represented the group's first major defeat after months of virtually unopposed victories which saw them take swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. At one point things looked so bad that Turkish President Recep Erdogan declared the city was only hours away from completely falling into ISIS' bloodstained hands. Victory was secured at the end of January after the last ISIS fighters were forced from the city's suburbs and into their strongholds along the Euphrates River. Civilians forced to flee across the border into Turkey are now returning home. Scroll down for video. Shell: The rusting remains of a tank sit along the side of a street in the border town of Kobane, just over a month after ISIS fighters were forced out of the city after months of fighting with Kurdish ground forces and bombing runs by coalition warplanes. Ruined: Virtually none of the buildings in the city were left untouched by the battle, which raged for six months, and marks the bloodiest and fiercest fight in the war against ISIS to date. The residents who survived or have returned are now faced with living in conditions like this. Pride: A Syrian Kurdish woman sweeps rubble out of what is left of her home after ISIS fighters fled the city of Kobane. The fighting here lasted for four months, and has left the city in ruins. Making the most of it: Just six months ago this Kurdish boy, along with thousands of other Kurds, were desperately fleeing Kobane, fearful they would be slaughtered if the city was overrun. Now they can return, but little of their previous home remains. Desperate: With little or no access to water and electricity, this young girl is forced to light a fire underneath rubble in the street to keep warm and cook her food. Shattered: A Kobane sign riddled with bullets and shrapnel marks mirrors the condition of the few building that are left standing around it. Homecoming: After four months of fierce fighting the Kurds, who were facing near extinction at the hands of ISIS, are able to return to what is left of their home town and begin rebuilding it. Flattened: A girl rides in a trailer being towed into Kobane by tractor as rows of levelled houses can be seen in the background. The city was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during six months of fighting in order to dislodge ISIS troops taking cover there. All gone: A Kurdish man looks out over the destroyed city of Kobane from the balcony of his bullet-riddled home, just over a month after the last ISIS fighters fled for their strongholds along the Euphrates River. Littered: A woman stands among the ruins of her old home, as the streets around her are scattered with rubble, clothes, and ruined cars. Destroyed: The remains of another tank are testament to the ferocity of the fighting in Kobane. Against all the odds, Kurdish forces which were at one point pinned in the centre of the city, managed to fight their way out and claim victory. Nothing left: A man holding a rolled up cigarette and clutching a glass of drink stands among the ruins of his house. At one point the situation here was so dire the Turkish Prime Minister warned the city was hours from falling into ISIS hands. All he has left: A Kurdish man walks back into his home after six months spent hiding from ISIS across the border in Turkey. On his back he carries everything he owns wrapped into a rug. Back to business: A baker goes back to work amid the shattered remain of Kobane as residents go about trying to rebuild their previous lives. What remains: A Kurdish boy walks down the stairwell of his home in Kobane, littered with rubble and a keyboard.

{"article": "It's not all in the stars for guests when it comes to comparing the best hotels around Europe. While five stars seems like a fairly straight-forward measurement, hotel and resort ratings aren't all created equal as there is  no uniform ratings system to keep it simple for tourists. According to research by\u00a0Hotels4u.com, 71 per cent of us don't realise that a five-star hotel in Spain can differ significantly to one in Great Britain, Turkey or Italy. The exclusive Goring Hotel must live up to demanding standards of service to be a British five-star hotel. France's ratings system was put together by the tourism  department and enforced by the Government, and five-star hotels such as Marseille's Le Petit Nice Passedat must live up to specific exacting standards. At British five-stars, guests being welcomed on arrival is among their many criteria for qualification. Each country has its own way to rank hotels from one-star to five and beyond, all with their own set of priorities and standards established by a range of authorities from local tourism bodies to government. In Great Britain, star ratings focus heavily on customer service, with a hotel not qualifying as a five-star without a greeting at the entrance and multilingual staff, along with a high quality food and wine menu and many other factors. While British standards are agreed by the AA (Automobile Association), VisitBritain, VisitScotland and VisitWales, France's exacting standards on what makes a five-star hotel - based on rooms, lobbies, services and amenities \u00a0- were decided by their tourism authority and are enforced by the French Government. A long list of criteria for a five-star hotel in France, such as the Hotel du Louvre in Paris, includes staff speaking English and one other foreign language, valet parking, multiple pools and kids clubs. Standards for Spanish hotels, such as the\u00a0Hotel Gran Melia Volcan lanzarote, are regulated regionally. Along with opulent interiors, Spain's Hotel Alfonso XIII must have a 24-hour concierge service to be five-star. IN SPAIN. Must offer the highest luxury. Specially adapted rooms for wheelchair users and will often provide extra facilities. 24-hour reception and\u00a024-hour concierge. Award-winning on-site dining facilities.

For the Italians, cleanliness is next to godliness for five-star hotels in their uniform star-rating system established in 2009 - a one-star hotel need only change bed sheets once a week but five-star, you'll be pleased to know, have to change them daily. Most hotels in Turkey are inspected by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism while a similar system in compulsory in Portugal and regulated Ministry of Economy and Innovation. Italy's hotel ratings system, established in 2009, is judged heavily on its standards of cleanliness.

Jimmy Thoronka, 20, disappeared at the end of the Games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country. Already orphaned by the war in Sierra Leone, he claims that his entire adopted family have been wiped out by the disease while he has been in the UK. Thoronka, who said that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK so he could fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete, now faces deportation. An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 57,000 signatures and\u00a0well wishers have donated more than \u00a324,000 to help the young athlete. Jimmy Thoronka carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone. He has been arrested for overstaying his visa and claims all his immediate family are dead from Ebola so he cannot return home. An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 57,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than \u00a324,000 to help the young athlete. Among the high profile names to support his plight are supermodel Lily Cole, and comedian Russell Brand. The Guardian said it had interviewed Thoronka before he was detained for overstaying his visa. He claimed there were no flights to Sierra Leone immediately after the Games and his team-mates all scattered, some staying with relatives and friends until they could return home. But he said his own bag - \u00a0containing his money and passport \u00a0- were stolen. His visa expired last September and after a brief stint with friends, he has been sleeping on the streets in parks and on buses ever since. He today told the BBC's Sarah Montague that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK so he could fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete. \u00a0Asylum is only granted to those who are in fear of persecution in their home country. He said of Sierra Leone: 'Nobody persecute me or anything, my problem is I don't have a family there to stay with. The person who would help me has passed by Ebola. If I go back i will not make it and I will kill myself, because i cannot pursue my dream. I want to be the fastest sprinter in the world.' When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for \u00a31 from passers-by to buy chips. 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.' Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games. He was arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He has since applied for asylum and has been released into Home Office accommodation. The newspaper said hundreds of people have since been in touch to offer support, and a petition has been set up on change.org to support him. It calls for the Government to 'let Jimmy stay here on compassionate grounds, so that he can find a sponsor to help him to continue his athletics career' and has received almost 58,000 signatures. It says: 'With our support, and the opportunities we have in the UK, Jimmy can have a new start and realise his huge potential as a sprinting star.'

But at that time transcripts of tape recordings made in the police control box where the match commander was stationed showed a subordinate officer calling for police dogs.

Mr Duckenfield said he had 'no idea' other than he wanted to create a'secure area' for the rescue operation. Mr Menon asked: 'So dogs requested, ambulances yet to be requested. Correct?' The witness replied: 'It would appear so.' At 3.06pm Mr Duckenfield called for operational support, a request for all available officers in the force area to go to the stadium. Mr Menon asked: 'Why more manpower?', to which\u00a0Duckenfield replied: 'To help the rescue.' The QC representing the families said responded: 'What rescue? You have yet to call for ambulances or fire crews.' The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers. On the day of the disaster, police became overwhelmed by fans at the turnstiles as kick-off approached and Mr Duckenfield gave the order at 2.52pm to open gates to let them in. Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C, many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them. But Mr Duckenfield, as match commander, had not ordered this to be closed, which was a 'blunder of the first magnitude', the inquest jury heard. The tunnel led directly to the already-full central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace. Some 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace. Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C (pictured), many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them, which had not been closed off by police. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the ensuing crush minutes later on the terraces of Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off. Mr Menon said police records did not record Duckenfield\u00a0declaring a major incident, which would have triggered a disaster rescue plan by emergency services. Mr Duckenfield insisted he had done so and there was an 'omission' in the records. Jurors were also told that an officer at the scene of the disaster made a call at 3.13pm for fire crews equipped with cutting gear to attend the scene. Mr Menon pointed out to Mr Duckenfield that the request for fire service assistance came up to eight minutes after the semi-final was halted. Mr Duckenfield agreed that the eight minutes represented a'serious amount of time' lost in the effort to save lives but said he was making decisions in a'very critical' situation. During the closing minutes of his questioning of the retired officer, Mr Menon asked him if he felt it necessary to be present on the pitch. Mr Duckenfield replied: 'Not at all. The incident commander remains in the control room because if I am not in the control room I can't make decisions.' The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers. Accusing Mr Duckenfield of showing little, if any, organisation or control while in the control box, Mr Menon asked the witness: 'Your leadership and co-ordination and emergency response was woefully inadequate from start to finish?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'I disagree, sir.' Rejecting claims that he was involved in 'building' South Yorkshire Police's case that drunken fans caused the disaster, the former policeman said: 'After the disaster I was marginalised and I took no part in anything like that at all.' Mr Menon then asserted: 'Your mistake (in failing to foresee where fans would go or close the tunnel) was the most terrifyingly bad mistake that fell", "abstract": "David Duckenfield, the police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster, has admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death. He denied his mindset was focused on hooliganism rather than safety at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989. Duckenfield has already made a series of admissions about 'mistakes' he made, confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised 'unreservedly' to fans' families."}
{"article": "A mother-of-five murdered her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper before hiding her body in a suitcase, a court has heard. Portugese national Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having kept the pregnancy a secret for nine months. Bristol Crown Court heard after she allegedly pushed the tissue in the infant's mouth, she wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it was found three days later. Claudia Martins, 33, gave birth alone in the bath at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol, having allegedly kept the pregnancy a secret. She is on trial at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) accused of murdering the baby girl. Paramedics were called to the property after friends and family members found 'a lot of blood' in the bath and Martins was taken to hospital. The court heard Martins repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant. During her hospital stay, Martins' sister noticed a smell coming from the suitcase and called police after she opened it and saw blood. Police  found the body of a newborn baby inside a small black suitcase. Martins, who was described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted that she had given birth, but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. Martins, who denies a single charge of murder on September 12 last year, wept during the opening of her trial at Bristol Crown Court today. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said two police officers were called to the flat Martins shared with her sister on September 15 last year. 'They were shown to the bathroom of the flat, where they saw and opened a suitcase,' he said. 'Inside, wrapped in towels and in a black plastic bag, they found the body of a newborn baby girl. Martins was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) but repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant - she was later arrested after her sister discovered the baby's body in a suitcase. 'The baby had been born three days earlier to the defendant, Claudia Martins. 'It is the prosecution's case that she killed the baby as soon as it was born and that she hid the body in the suitcase. 'It is the defence case that she never knew she was pregnant and when she gave birth it was stillborn and that she hid it in the suitcase out of a mixture of shock and panic.' The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011. She lived in a two-bedroom flat with her sister, Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children, which was 'difficult and pressurised', Mr Vaitilingam said. In late 2013 Martins became pregnant and the father of the baby was later identified by DNA analysis as Polish man Jacob Kucmus. 'The baby was full term when born on September 12 2014,' Mr Vaitilingam said. 'We don't know when she first realised, because she never told anyone that she was pregnant nor - as far as we are able to say - consulted with a doctor.' Friends and family suspected that Martins was pregnant but she denied this and refused to go to a doctor, it is alleged. Martins' sister, Vilma, was pregnant with a baby girl at the same time and gave birth a week before Martins did. A naming ceremony was held at the flat on September 12 but Martins went upstairs to the bathroom at 7pm complaining of a bad back. Friends at the party later went to check on Martins and found her bleeding, with 'a lot of blood' in the bath, Mr Vaitilingam said. They called an ambulance and paramedics arrived at 8.54 to find Martins in a sarong, with a 'heavily bloodstained towel' between her legs. The paramedics persuaded Martins to leave with them at 10.40pm and headed to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. 'Before she left, Claudia went to a suitcase that was in the far corner of the room and rummaged around in it,' Mr Vaitilingam told the court. 'It looked to the paramedics as though she was rearranging items within the suitcase, and she then shut it and placed items on top of it before leaving with them for the hospital.' Dr Russell Delaney carried out a post-mortem examination and found the baby was normally formed, with no evidence of disease to account for death. Due to the level of decomposition, medical experts are unable to determine whether the baby was born dead or alive. But Dr Delaney found a wad of five pieces of wet tissue paper - the same as on a toilet roll in the bathroom. Mr Vaitilingam tol the court the paper had", "abstract": "Claudia Martins, a mother-of-five, is on trial at Bristol Crown Court accused of murdering her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper before hiding her body in a suitcase.

Doctor David Bardens attempted to claim the prize after providing the biologist with a \u00a0comprehensive study that had been published in a medical journal. Lanka was hauled before a German Court when he failed to uphold his side of the bargain and pay up, reported\u00a0The Local.

In West Africa scientists are warning that hard-to-treat areas that have already been hit by Ebola are now at risk of a measles outbreak. Ebola derailed child immunisations in  Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, leaving hundreds of thousands more children vulnerable to the more routine infections, researchers said. Measles epidemics often follow humanitarian crises because'measles is so incredibly contagious,' explained Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Justin Lessler, who led the study published in the journal Science.

But now Ted Cruz says he and his family will be the latest to use the system, signing up for medical insurance coverage through the Obamacare law's government-run marketplaces. Cruz's wife Heidi has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs to campaign with him \u2013 and lost her employer-funded plan in the process. As Democrats gleefully mocked the irony, though, Cruz insists he's just following the law. OBAMASCARE: Ted Cruz announced his presidential run on Monday, the same day his wife took a leave of absence from her job \u2013 forgoing the family's medical insurance. PEDIATRICS ON LINE ONE: The Cruz daughters, Catherine (left) and Caroline (right) need a health plan and for now the Obamacare system will have to do \u2013 while their father works to 'rip it out, root and branch' TRANSITION: Heidi Cruz left her Goldman Sachs 'Cadillac Plan' behind when she took a leave of absence to campaign for her husband. 'We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we're in the process of transitioning over to do that,' Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, told The Des Moines Register\u00a0on Tuesday. The exchanges, created by the Obamacare law, are designed to be state-specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage. Using them is mandatory for middle-income Americans who want to receive federal government subsidies to help pay their premiums. The Affordable Care Act originally left members of Congress alone, but Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley famously inserted a 'poison pill' amendment requiring them \u2013 and their staff members \u2013 to participate like other Americans if they lacked insurance from other sources. 'The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better,' Grassley said back then. Democrats didn't budge, and the provision now requires Cruz to join millions who have signed up for Obamacare-brokered coverage. He could get the last laught, however, using his experience to construct a first-hand testimonial about the law's shortcomings. Liberal lawmakers were mum Tuesday on the development, passing up an easy opportunity to call Cruz a hypocrite. Daily Mail Online asked five Senate offices and five House offices, all Democratic, for comment. None would offer one. Planned Parenthood, America's biggest abortion lobby, did use the 'H' word. It has defended the Obamacare law, largely because it forces insurers to provide contraception coverage. 'Luckily for Sen. Ted Cruz, hypocrisy isn't a pre-existing condition,' the group tweeted. The Democratic National Committee weighed in, but offered only a half-swing at the softball question. 'The Affordable Care Act, by design, helps Americans who have gaps in employment get coverage, and it's working,' DNC National Press Secretary Holly Shulman told Daily Mail Online. 'We encourage others to follow presidential candidate Ted Cruz to www.healthcare.gov and get covered.' The Houston firebrand won't exactly get a grassroots experience when he enrolls, however. GLEE: The Democratic National Committee piled on, but never called Cruz a hypocrite. THe 'H' WORD: Abortion lobby Planned Parenthood heaped on the scorn at Cruz's predicament. The Washington, D.C. city government extends congressional offices a sweetheart deal that's not part of the Affordable Care Act itself, allowing federal lawmakers and their aides to enroll through the city's Small Business Health Options Program. That system was designed for'small businesses' with fewer than 50 employees. The United States Congress employs more than 20,000 people. It also makes medical insurance customers eligible for payments from their employers for most of the premiums. The Obama administration's Office of Personnel Management made the arrangement legal by quietly issuing a rule just before the Obamacare law took effect \u2013 and setting the typical reimbursement level at 75 per cent. Some customers, including well-paid senators, will get that benefit even though their income levels would be too high to qualify for subsidies if they had to buy coverage on the open exchanges like millions of others. Cruz told CNN on Tuesday that he has no choice but to 'follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with.' 'It's one of the real differences \u2013 if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change,' Cruz said. NOT TOO LATE, TED: Even though the Obamacare open-enrollment period is over, Americans can still sign up if they 'have certain life changes in 2015' He also took a verbal swing at Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who has allowed professional staffers on Senate committees to exempt themselves. 'Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats didn't want to be under the same rules as the American people,' he sniped.

Oscar Pistorius's lawyers have failed in their attempt to stop prosecutors appealing against the double-amputee athlete's negligent killing conviction. Judge Thokozile Masipa dismissed their application to challenge the appeal by prosecutors, who want Pistorius convicted of the more serious charge of murder for shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, multiple times in a bathroom in his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. 'The order that I grant in this matter is to strike off the application,' the black-robed Judge Masipa said in her ruling today, dismissing the defence's application. In December, Judge Masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit Pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter. Pistorius's lawyers were arguing that the judge should not have allowed that appeal. The Olympian and multiple Paralympic champion is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide, or negligent killing. The 28-year-old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital, Pretoria, in August to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. If prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the Supreme Court of Appeal and have it upgraded to murder, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail. Judge Masipa, who presided over Pistorius's seven-month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors, made her latest ruling after a short court session in Johannesburg. Pistorius's trial was held in another courthouse in Pretoria. Failed bid: The athlete's lawyer Barry Roux (pictured) argued that prosecutors had'mistakenly' been given permission to appeal against Judge Masipa's initial trial verdict of manslaughter. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel (above) said there was no basis for the application by the defence, which wanted a 'never-ending case' to prevent it from going to the appeal court. The judge heard arguments by Barry Roux, Pistorius's chief defence lawyer at trial, and Gerrie Nel, the chief prosecutor. Mr Roux argued that prosecutors had'mistakenly' been given permission to appeal against Judge Masipa's initial trial verdict. Mr Nel said there was no basis for the application by the defence, which wanted a 'never-ending case' to prevent it from going to the appeal court. Pistorius's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which sits in the central city of Bloemfontein. No date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court, legal experts have said.

The Sun newspaper reports that David Walliams and his wife Lara Stone (pictured in what is believed to be their second last public appearance together at Elton John's December 2014 wedding) have split after less than five years of marriage. Is this the end? David's wife reportedly left their North London home on Tuesday night leaving him 'devastated' A source close to the comedian said: 'David has been putting on a brave face. But people close to him are very worried because they know he's devastated. In fact, David tweeted that it was business as usual for him on Wednesday. He wrote: 'The #WalliamsWhirlwind helicopter tour of schools for @WorldBookDayUK tomorrow will go ahead as planned so not to disappoint my young fans.' Lara and David have a reported wealth of almost \u00a319million - David has a  net worth of \u00a316.3million and Lara \u00a32.6million. News of their split has come as a huge surprise to friends despite the fact they have barely been seen together over the past six months. David and Lara attended Elton John's wedding to David Furnish together on December \u00a021 and two days later watched the London production of Edwards Scissorhands together, which was the last time they were seen out in public together. The insider told the newspaper that his friends are shocked by the split as they thought the marriage was strong - but friends are hoping they will get back together. The source said: 'David hopes it is a blip and that they can get the marriage back on track somehow, especially seeing as there is a child involved.' The way they were: The couple, who wed in May 2010, have a two-year-old son, Alfred together. Putting on a brave face:\u00a0David tweeted that it was business as usual for him on Wednesday, in spite of the sudden split. Lara's last tweet was on Monday, when she posted something about work.\u00a0She wrote: '#BTS for lorealparisofficial #Elvive #fibralogy #shampoo #XLhair #worthit #LorealParis.' The alleged split has happened almost five years after they tied the knot. David and Lara began dating in September 2009 after David took her to a Chelsea football match - with the funnyman later filling her home with flowers. Their relationship began after Lara's now-beaten battle with alcoholism following a stint in rehab in 2009. Serious: It has been claimed Lara took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert (who they jokingly refer to as their other child ) with her when she left their North London home. High hopes: The couple (pictured in May 2013) may have reportedly split but David is said to be already plotting to get Lara back. She's gone!\u00a0According to The Sun, Lara took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert with them when she left their North London home.

{"article": "(CNN)Early Intervention changes lives. Respite care keeps families together. Both save states money over time. Alas, both -- along with a huge swathe of other vital services -- are under attack by the administration of Bruce Rauner, the new Republican governor of Illinois. This is happening for two reasons. First, Rauner has a problem. He promised to lower taxes despite a $6.2 billion structural budget deficit. Unwilling to think about new revenue, all he can do is cut programs. Second, Rauner's cuts are taking place against the backdrop of a bigger attack on disability. Too many right-wing politicians and pundits see disability as a wedge issue with which they can divide interest groups, pit people who need help against each other and rip apart the core social safety net. Meanwhile, they reassure their base, which is filled with individuals who also need help from the state, that only they really deserve benefits. Like Rauner, other governors are cutting services in the name of austerity. Kansas, under Sam Brownback, has pushed disabled people off Medicaid, making services less effective and efficient.  Scott Walker, in Wisconsin, has proposed cutting long-term care services in such a way as to limit individual choice of caregivers and service providers, empowering the healthcare industry and not disabled Americans. Florida has gutted benefits to severely disabled individuals in workers' compensation cases and eliminated countless positions in the Department of Health. And that's all just at the state level. Nationally, the new Congress began the year with a sustained attack on Social Security Disability Insurance, which some analysts see as a way to threaten the whole foundation of Social Security. Last December, House Republicans insisted that the ABLE act, a bill intended to help people with disabilities and their caregivers save money, only be offered to those who were disabled before the age of 26, a limitation aimed at excluding people who become disabled through work, disease, accident or age. Now Bruce Rauner is adding to this troubling pattern. The Rauner budget slashes state spending by over $4 billion, much of the savings gleaned by eliminating or reducing eligibility for programs based in the Department of Human Services (DHS). Each cut will come with costs to families and individuals who need the state's help most. Moreover, many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time. Take, for example, Early Intervention, which provides services to children with developmental delays from birth to age 3 at little cost to the parents (there are means-tested co-pays).  At their best, these therapies not only help children with disabilities learn new skills, but also teach parents to better understand their children. Right now, a child who is at least 30% delayed in any category -- for example being at least 30% less able to use speech than a typical child of their age -- is eligible for services. Now, as explained to me by a spokesperson for DHS, the program has to save $23 million (they did not explain how this number was picked). The plan is to take every child who is 30-49% delayed (about 10,000 children), re-test them, and remove eligibility from thousands of those deemed the least deserving until the arbitrary dollar amount is reached. Over the long term, this is not only bad for children, but is bad for Illinois' budget. The program is extremely economically efficient. For each dollar spent on programs like Early Intervention, according to studies by people such as the Nobel Laureate James Heckman and the Rand Corporation, the state saves at least $7 in future services. Those savings are, in fact, most likely to be realized most dramatically with precisely the children that DHS is trying to exclude. Children with only mild delays can, with Early Intervention, avoid requiring the more expensive special education services in school when they are older. Everyone wins. Despite this Gregory Bassi, acting secretary of DHS, is undeterred. At a recent state Senate budget hearing, which I attended, Bassi kept saying that the program was too expensive and seemed unable to address the long-term costs of short-term savings. He even, in a revealing moment, said that his own nephew ought to get booted from the program because the nephew's parents make too much money (a spokesperson clarified that Bassi actually has two nephews in the program, both of whom have benefited from the therapy). Respite programs, which the Rauner budget eliminates entirely, provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities.  Sometimes, such a program just enables the caregiver to do errands or have some private time, essential to maintaining one's ability to function in a challenging home environment. The programs also provide emergency backup should the caregiver have a medical problem or some other issue. Like Early Intervention, the program is cost efficient.  Without respite, families are more likely to disintegrate. In such cases, the person with a disability is likely to end up in a state-run facility. This is both vastly more expensive and, most importantly,", "abstract": "The new Republican governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, is cutting vital services, including Early Intervention and respite care, due to a $6.2 billion structural budget deficit and a bigger attack on disability. Rauner's cuts are part of a troubling pattern of right-wing politicians and pundits seeing disability as a wedge issue to divide interest groups and pit people who need help against each other. However, many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time, and without them, families are more likely to disintegrate, leading to more expensive state-run facilities."}

{"article": "A Nasa mission designed to study the interaction of Earth's magnetic field and the sun launched this morning at 2:44am GMT (last night at 10:44pm EDT). The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission will use four identical spacecraft to measure a mysterious process known as magnetic reconnection. By orbiting Earth, the spacecraft will seek to understand how energy from the sun is funnelled in to the environment of not only our own but other planets, causing space weather such as aurorae. Scroll down for video. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Nasa's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft onboard is seen here launching from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida this morning at\u00a02:44am GMT (last night at 10:44pm EDT) The groundbreaking and complex mission represents the first time this astronomical phenomena will be studied in extremely fine detail. The spacecraft were launched on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 421 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. After reaching orbit, each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five-minute increments. 'I am speaking for the entire MMS team when I say we're thrilled to see all four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet,' said Craig Tooley, project manager at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Magnetic reconnection occurs wherever charged gases, called plasma, are present. It's rare on Earth, but plasma makes up 99 per cent of the visible universe, fueling stars and filling the near-vacuum of space. This plasma contains magnetic fields that affects the way charged particles it encounters move. Under normal conditions, the magnetic field lines inside plasmas don't break or merge with other field lines. But sometimes, as field lines get close to each other, the entire pattern changes and everything realign into a new configuration. The amount of energy released can be formidable. Magnetic reconnection taps into the stored energy of the magnetic field, converting it into heat and kinetic energy that sends particles streaming out along the field lines. The MMS mission will help scientsits understand how this process is taking place in the environment around Earth. This could teach us more about geomagnetic storms and aurorae on our planet, and also help us understand similar processes taking place in the rest of the solar system and beyond. Over the following weeks, Nasa scientists and engineers will deploy several complex booms and antennae on the spacecraft, and test all their instruments. The core of each spacecraft is about four feet (1.2 metres) tall and 11 feet (3.4 metres) wide, although with all of their booms and antennae deployed, they grow to 369 by 94ft (29 by 112 metres). The four will then be placed in a pyramid formation, separated by distances of 6.2 to 62 miles (10 to 100km), in preparation for science observations that are scheduled to begin in early September. They will fly around Earth in an elliptical orbit, travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring. One of these is the side of Earth nearest the sun, where plasma from the sun interacts with Earth's magnetosphere. This interaction transfers energy from the sun to Earth's environment, creating'magnetic explosions' when the magnetic field lines connect. The process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy that are as powerful as billions of megatons of TNT, which send particles surging through space at the speed of light. On Earth, we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles, but it can also be dangerous to satellites and cause problems for communications. At the other side of Earth, away from the sun, the spacecraft will pass through a region where Earth's magnetic field lines combine, and produce a similar effect.

They were stacked together for the launch (illustrated) The spacecraft will fly around Earth in an elliptical orbit, travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring.

{"article": "An Australian couple spent five terrifying hours trapped inside the car with their two young children not knowing whether they were going to survive the wrath of Cyclone Pam which tore apart the island of Vanuatu. Beth and Kris Russet moved to the island in 2009 and spent 18 months building a cyclone-proof house before moving into the beautiful home just four months ago in November with their children Charlotte, 3, and Henry,14 months, and also Beth's mother. But nothing could have prepared the couple for the hell they endured as each room in their brand new home began to rapidly fill up with water after the ceiling was ripped off leaving the petrified family exposed to the ferocious and deadly elements of the worst cyclone to have hit the Pacific region in living memory. Beth Russet - left with Henry, and Kris Russet - right with Charlotte, 3, spent five terrifying hours in their car as Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu. The polished new deck before it got ripped apart - pictured are the two German Shepherds who survived the cyclone on back of the ute. The entire roof of the decking blew off during the cyclone and exposed plywood was flying through the house. The brand new open kitchen and dining room where the family used to spend a lot of their time. The ceiling in the kitchen was ripped off and rain started coming in sideways along with a ferocious wind tunnel. The night began like any other for the Russet's on March 13, they had settled in to watch a movie with a glass of wine in hand after putting the kids to bed. However, within two hours the pair were frantically moving their children and Beth's mother from one room to another as their family home began to resemble an indoor swimming pool. 'Our walls started to rain - it was coming in too hard and too fast,' Beth said. 'I had to put Henry in the pram because I couldn't carry him while we kept having to move them from one room to the next.' 'We were trying to stay calm for the kids but the roar of the wind was so amazing that we had to keep yelling at each other over the noise. 'We were tying to keep our happy faces on so the kids would be fine.' But this was no easy feast as the entire roof from the large decking outside had torn off causing exposed plywood to come flying into the open living area. 'All of the doors stayed shut but as soon as the roof came off it was as if we had no walls - then the kitchen fan flew off and rain started coming in sideways and a wind tunnel began,' she said. 'We couldn't get from one side of the house to the other without help and holding hands because it was flood waters and the wind was just so strong.' Three-year -old Charlotte's room is completely trashed after the epic storm. The ceiling was blasted open with parts falling onto the ground in 14 month old Henry's nursery. Probably the scariest of many hairy moments throughout the night was when Beth's mum and Kris had a ceiling collapse from above them in the master bedroom just as Beth had moved the children into her son's nursery. 'I turned around to get my mum from the bedroom when the ceiling came in on her and the ceiling fan missed her head by inches,' Beth said. 'The door slammed with the wind and I couldn't get in - I had no idea how she was but luckily my husband was in there and she was ok.' The family vowed to stick together from that point on - including their two German Shepherds and a reluctant cat. Eventually they moved to the bathroom because there was too much potential for the nursery ceiling to collapse as water was pouring in from the down lights, however the bathroom presented the exact same problem. 'We did the big dramatic run to the kids bathroom because it's mainly concrete walls and a big bath tub so we thought it would be really safe there,' she said.

They decided that they would attempt to drive down the road to Kris's dad's farm.

'We didn't know how much water was around and I couldn't handle it if the car started to slide away and I would somehow have to let my children out of their car seats.

{"article": "Two neighbouring ancient craters thought to be have been formed by the same impact event are now thought to have been created by two separate asteroids. The extremely unlikely formation theory was reached after scientists re-analysed rocks at the site, and found dates for the two were vastly different. While both had been thought to be 285 million years old, it now appears one of the craters is actually 450 million years old but, by chance, was created in almost exactly the same spot. Scroll down for video. The two Clearwater Lake craters in Canada may not have been formed by a binary asteroid. Its thought the East crater asteroid impacted a marine environment during the Ordovician period, 490 million years ago. The West crater was created in the Permian period 285 million years ago and impacted the landmass Pangaea. Researchers from the University of Western Australia say the Clearwater lakes in Canada were formed by two separate events in a 'pure coincidence'. The remarkable finding, if confirmed, has important implications for other so-called 'doublet' craters in the solar system, previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time. And the huge difference in time between the two events is even more amazing as, at the time the first crater was made, the location of the second was underwater. The research was published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta and reported by Astrobiology Magazine. Impacts that leave behind a 62-mile (100km) diameter crater or less, such as those that struck the Clearwater lakes, are widely thought to have no global effects. In fact, impacts can even increase biodiversity. For example, the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, which saw an explosion in the number of animal species around 470 million years ago, has been linked to frequent impact events at the time. This is possibly due to the fact that an impact could disrupt local life just enough to let another species dominate, or because slowly cooling craters can provide habitats for life. Even if the Clearwater Lakes impacts were caused by a double impact, the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the Earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life. While the fireball and earthquake would have decimated any life within a few hundred kilometers, the impacts were not big enough to cause much chaos on a global scale. The Clearwater lakes in Canada are a pair of lakes labelled as West and East. The smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles (26km) in diameter, while the western crater is about 22 miles (36km). In the original theory, a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago. But the researchers say the original methods used to date the East lake, by measuring amounts of argon-40, were inaccurate. Upon analysing new samples at the site, they found a maximum age of 460 million years, far older than the West Clearwater Lake, which is 285 million years old. 'The close spatial arrangement of the two Clearwater Lakes is most likely pure coincidence,' the researchers wrote in their paper. A similar figure was reached by researchers in 1990 by a separate research team, but at the time the findings were dismissed as incorrect due to a supposed contamination from excess argon. But with four different rock samples from various parts of the lake now studied, the researchers say it is highly unlikely they would all yield the same false age. 'We think that the accurate age for the East Clearwater crater was, in fact, already measured back in 1990,' said geologist and lead author Dr Martin Schmieder of the university. The smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles (26km) in diameter, while the western crater is about 22 miles (36km).\u00a0In the original theory, a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago, but that is now believed to be inaccurate. The remarkable finding, if confirmed, has important implications for other so-called 'doublet' craters in the solar system, previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time. Shown is a map of the location of the Clearwater Lakes. It's unlikely that the event that formed the Clearwater Lakes had any significant impact on life.\u00a0Even if the Clearwater Lakes impacts were caused by a double impact, the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the Earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life. Further evidence for the latest findings comes from the amount of chlorine in the two craters. This part of Canada - referred to as Laurentia - had less land 460 million years ago than it did 285 million years ago, when waters receded, forming the landmass called Pangaea. The rocks from the East crater have more chlorine than the West crater, suggesting they formed on a coastline when water was still abundant in the area. Despite the fact that it is statistically very unlikely for the two craters to have been formed in", "abstract": "Scientists have discovered that two neighbouring ancient craters in Canada, previously thought to have been formed by the same impact event, were actually created by two separate asteroids.

His insistence on short game practice, and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department, have informed the modern professional's approach. \"I did space research and golf research on my own time,\" explained the brains behind the two-ball putter, one of the best-selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately. \"NASA has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race. Sputnik had just gone up. \"We were trying to catch the Russians in terms of space exploration.

He famously played the legendary Jack Nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18-time major champion on every occasion, but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for NASA. Using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists, Pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he'd picked up at the Goddard Space Flight Center. And gradually, piece by piece, he began to deconstruct each facet of his game and isolate the improvements he needed to make. \"I started measuring my own putting,\" he said. \"I started measuring my short game. I started measuring my driving. \"I learned how to measure things at Goddard Space Flight Center because they had the best instruments in the world and I learned the practical application of the scientific method. \"I finally started understanding my game after 10 years of research. It's funny to say from a person who went to college for four years on a golf scholarship. \"Those thousand lessons that taught me virtually nothing... they might not have been teaching right but it was also partly I wasn't listening and I wasn't looking for the things that I needed to look for. \"All of a sudden I qualified again for the U.S. Amateur (America's leading competition for amateur golfers) and I'm not practicing at all like I used to but my game was better. I was a better player.\" Despite this spike in quality, Pelz was still hesitant when it came to the prospect of throwing his lot in on the PGA Tour with other professionals. \"I had a serious thinking period,\" he explained. \"And I thought the game really doesn't need another good player. \"I believed by now that if I really worked hard I could be a really good player and I might be able to make it on the Tour, but I'd never be the best player in the world. \"I didn't have that kind of practice time in me. At this stage I'm 35 now and I got so involved in the research of golf, in finding out about my own game, I thought 'I could help a lot of players.' \"What the world really needs is for somebody to tell them what they're doing wrong so they can score better and enjoy the game more. \"That's really what golf is about. It's really not what you shoot, it's whether or not you are improving.\" While Pelz's brain power is not in question, his business acumen is -- by his own admission.

A nine-year-old girl, who attends Sunnycrest Elementary School in Lake Stevens, Washington, was using a school computer during class, when she was able to access the porn. She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation. The students have been suspended from Sunnycrest Elementary School, pictured, after finding sexually explicit images on a school computer. The incident only emerged when an email was sent to parents promising that a full investigation into the incident would take place. The girl and another student have now been suspended from the school, with Lake Stevens School District promising a probe into how the student was able to find the pictures despite filters being in place. But some parents have reacted angrily after learning their children had seen the explicit images. Austin Maxwell, whose eight-year-old stepdaughter attends the school, told K5 that she was upset after seeing the pictures and that he was shocked a child was able to find such content on a school computers. He said: 'We never in he world would have thought she was accessing what she was accessing on the school's equipment.' The third grade student was said to find the explicit images after circumnavigating the school's computer network which filters adult content. The email sent to parents by district officials said that all student computer use at the school is being suspended until a full investigation takes place. It read: 'Once staff members became aware of the situation, Information Technology technicians were immediately notified and all student computer use at Sunnycrest is suspended until our investigation is complete. 'To ensure that all images have been removed, our technicians have deleted content from all Sunnycrest third-grade students' computer accounts.

{"article": "Smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies, scientists say. Similarly, pollution from coal fires and traffic fumes disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour. Scans of inner-city children from before birth until aged seven to nine revealed those exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower white matter in their left brain, impairing intelligence and causing ADHD and aggression. Scroll down for video. Experts are warning that smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies. As they grew up it caused problems in concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving. The US study looked at neurotoxic PAH - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - and its effects on the brains of inner city kids. They are contained in vehicles fumes, coal fires or oil central heating systems, power plants, wildfires and agricultural burning, tobacco smoke and hazardous waste sites. Earlier studies has shown PAH can readily cross the placenta and affects an unborn child's brain and animal studies showed that prenatal exposure impaired the development of behaviour, learning and memory. The study by the Institute for the Developing Mind at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Columbia University's Centre for Children's Environmental Health tested the effects on brain structure of PAH exposure during the final trimester of pregnancy. It involved taking brain scans of 40 children in New York, followed from before birth until aged seven to nine. Traffic fumes, pollution from coal fires and smoke from burnt food disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour. They were part of a cohort of more than 600 mother-baby pairs from which Columbia researchers had previously reported exposure to airborne PAH during gestation was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances. These included development delay by the age of three, reduced verbal IQ at five, and symptoms of anxiety and depression by seven. Professor of paediatrics and psychiatry Bradley Peterson said: 'This is the largest MRI study to date of how early life exposure to air pollutants, specifically PAH, affect the developing mind. 'Our findings suggest that PAH are contributors to ADHD and other behavioural problems due to the pollutants' disruptive effects on early brain development.' Results published in JAMA Psychiatry showed reductions in nearly the entire white matter surface of the brain's left hemisphere. Recent research has also found the impact that smoking has on a foetus. Image shows the 4-D ultrasound scan of two foetuses at 32 weeks gestation, one whose mother was a smoker (top) and the other carried by a non-smoker (bottom). The foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more, indicating its development is delayed. This loss was associated with slower processing of information during intelligence testing and more severe behavioural problems, including ADHD and aggression. Postnatal PAH exposure - measured at age five - was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in the dorsal prefrontal region of the brain, which is associated with concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving ability. Prof Peterson explained that the morphological features associated with ADHD symptoms in this community sample differed from those previously reported in youth with the disorder, suggesting that exposure to high levels of PAH may produce a specific subtype of ADHD. Although the study involved a small sample of ethnic minority children in poor inner city areas with low educational achievements, a larger study is underway. He added: 'Our findings raise important concerns about the effects of air pollutants on brain development in children, and the consequences of those brain effects on cognition and behaviour. 'If confirmed, our findings have important public health implications, given the ubiquity of PAH in air pollutants in the general population.' New ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers. Experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby's central nervous system is delayed. Now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up. The baby whose mother was a smoker (top) and the other carried by a non-smoker (bottom) show developmental differences. Dr Nadja Reissland, of Durham University,  said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems. As part of the study, Dr Nadja Reissland, of Durham University, used 4-D ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb. She monitored 20 mothers attending the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, four of whom smoked an average of 14 cigarettes a day. After studying their scans at 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks, she detected that foetuses whose mothers smoked continued to show significantly higher rates of mouth movement and self-touching than those carried by non-smokers. The pilot study, which Dr Reissland hopes to expand with a bigger sample, found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system.", "abstract": "A US study has found that smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies, causing problems in concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving as they grow up.

The person, Farabi Shafiur Rahman, had called for Avijit Roy's death in numerous Facebook posts, according to Roy's parents. And within minutes after the Thursday attack, Rahman posted photos of the crime scene, said Col. Ziaul Ahsan of Bangladesh's elite anti-crime unit, the Rapid Action Battalion. In a Facebook comment last year, Rahman allegedly wrote, \"Avijit Roy lives in America. So it's not possible to kill him now.

They threatened to kill him if he came home from the United States to visit. As usual, Roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban Atlanta for Dhaka, where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled \"The Virus of Faith.\" He has written seven books in all. Roy was killed Thursday as he walked back from a book fair with his wife. Assailants plunged machetes and knives into Roy and his wife, killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger. Witnesses said no one came to the couple's aid as they were hacked down. Rahman, the man in custody, also allegedly posted threats against the owner of the online bookstore, Rokomari.com, forcing it to stop selling Roy's books. And last year, he was detained -- then released -- for comments he allegedly made in support of the death of another blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider. Like Roy, Haider too was hacked to death.

{"article": "After a career working with some of European football\u2019s top clubs, Jose Mourinho has experienced the highs and lows of management. On Friday, as he raised his right arm high into the air to emphasise his point, Mourinho wanted it made clear to Graeme Souness and\u00a0Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher that he remains at the top of his game. It was a low blow, calling the Sky Sports analysts out because they dared to criticise Chelsea\u2019s players for surrounding Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers during the Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. Jose Mourinho opened up about the criticism aimed at his Chelsea by  Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness. Mourinho was in a spiky mood during a lively press conference on Friday and was full of gestures. Mourinho came up with another famous quip:\u00a0\u2018Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man' Mourinho claimed they were envious of his success as a coach, claiming the former Liverpool players have short memories after their careers at the top of the sport. The Chelsea manager said: \u2018Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man. It\u2019s about life. \u2018The difference between me and Souness is this: Souness as a player, up there (raises arm). Jose as a player, down here. Jose as a manager, up here. Souness as a manager, down there.\u2019 With that the Chelsea manager pulled one of those faces that suggested the pair do not even belong on the same planet, let alone Souness having the right to pass comment on his team. It did not end there. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said the pressure Chelsea put on the referee was 'disgraceful' Carragher, Thierry Henry (centre) and Graeme Souness dissect Chelsea's exit from the Champions League. Mourinho added: \u2018I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man. He was a fantastic player. I have lots of respect, in spite of some episodes, for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players. \u2018You know the world is a bit strange \u2014 maybe with the diet and the quality of products we are eating, memories are getting shorter. \u2018When Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak, it\u2019s because they are having a problem for sure. Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he forgets everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. \u2018I coached Benfica, I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I\u2019m a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh.\u2019 Mourinho watches on as defender Kurt Zouma (left) prepares to play a ball during training on Friday. Chelsea striker Diego Costa keeps the ball up while sitting on the floor at the Cobham training ground. Chelsea players in training ahead of the Premier League game against Southampton on Sunday.

Chelsea\u2019s manager was spiky on Friday, confrontational at times as he attempted to put a positive spin on a negative result in the last 16 of the Champions League. The guard dropped again when he claimed Chelsea would definitely win the Barclays Premier League and he went on to make a case that they should be \u2018eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12 points\u2019 clear of Manchester City. In public he is supporting his squad, although he was less than keen to divulge details of the 30-minute team meeting held at the training ground the day after their elimination. Souness was manager of Benfica in Portugal\u00a0for two years, between 1997 and 1999, before Mourinho.

They certainly take responsibility for ill-discipline, with Mourinho revealing that his players pay the fines if they are charged by the authorities for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee. Chelsea were fined \u00a330,000 by the Premier League after they were charged following the behaviour of their players towards Jonathan Moss on February 11. Mourinho, preparing for Saturday's clash with Southampton at Stamford Bridge, added: \u2018If they surround the referee we are charged and we have to pay a fine, and if we do that the players pay the fine.

{"article": "West Brom boss Tony Pulis is keeping his cards close to his chest in terms of his goalkeeper selection for Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa. The Barclays Premier League derby between the two clubs at Villa Park on Tuesday ended in a 2-1 victory for the hosts after a stoppage-time error from Ben Foster saw the Baggies and England shot-stopper give away a penalty that was converted by Christian Benteke. Pulis spoke up for Foster - who has kept six clean sheets in all competitions since the Welshman took over at Albion - after the game. Ben Foster is not guaranteed to keep his place against Aston Villa in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Foster brought down Matthew Lowton to concede a penalty against Villa in Premier League clash on Tuesday. Christian Benteke scored from the spot to give their midlands rivals a late victory at Villa Park. And while refusing to say outright whether or not the 31-year-old would keep his place at the weekend, the head coach once again had praise for Foster at his press conference on Thursday to preview the cup tie. Asked about his goalkeeper selection for Saturday's game, Pulis said: 'I'll be telling the goalkeepers first before I tell you! 'Boaz Myhill has had an injury with a finger, which we have to take into account. 'With the number of clean sheets he has kept (12 overall this season), Ben has been absolutely fantastic. 'Everybody makes mistakes. Goalkeepers get highlighted, like referees, because it can cost you games.' Baggies boss Tony Pulis has backed his No 1 without confirming Foster will keep his place on Saturday. Saido Berahino celebrates while being chased by his team-mates, after netting his 18th goal of the season. With regard to referees, another notable incident from the latter stages of Tuesday's game saw Villa defender Alan Hutton make a nasty-looking challenge on West Brom striker Saido Berahino and the pair square up to each other before each being booked. It appeared Hutton was lucky not to have been sent off by referee Jonathan Moss. And while Pulis was keen on Thursday to avoid hitting out at the official for not doing so, he did once again express his desire for there to be a referral system for managers during games where they get 'two calls' each, something he has spoken about in the past. 'I've seen the challenge back,' said Pulis. Alan Hutton appeared to raise his studs into Berahino's leg during Aston Villa's win over West Brom. Berahino goes down in pain on the touchline following Hutton's nasty challenge on Tuesday. Hutton and Berahino squared up after the challenge (left) and were both booked by referee Jonathan Moss. 'I thought Jon managed the game pretty well, and there are enough people at the moment criticising referees and looking to blame them. 'Jon didn't cost us the game on Tuesday, we cost ourselves the game. 'People make good decisions and bad decisions and you have to accept it - but I'm sure he'll look back at it and maybe will analyse it differently to how he did on the night.' He then added: 'I would have two calls during a game, where managers can call things back. 'You could put advertising on the big screens (at the same time) - the clubs could make some money from it. Pulis has labelled the alleged spitting incident involving Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse as 'disgusting' 'And it gives a chance to the officials to get right decisions that could be big. They, FIFA and UEFA, have to accept that referees do make mistakes.' Pulis also made his feelings clear about spitting following Wednesday night's incident involving Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse. 'It is disgusting and disgraceful,' Pulis said. 'Spitting should never be anywhere near our game. It should be dealt with.' Pulis, while mindful of his side's ongoing league battle to avoid relegation, says he will try to put his'strongest team' out on Saturday. Stephane Sessegnon (right) will be given time to cope with 'personal problems' before returning to the team. Forward Victor Anichebe (groin) remains unavailable, and winger Callum McManaman is a doubt due to a foot injury. Pulis has also said West Brom 'have to go careful' with Stephane Sessegnon due to the forward's 'personal problems' - understood to be a family bereavement - and that there are a few 'knocks and niggles' to deal with. Berahino and fellow frontman Brown Ideye have both been playing recently with pain-killing injections.", "abstract": "West Brom manager Tony Pulis has refused to confirm whether Ben Foster will keep his place in goal for the FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa on Saturday.

{"article": "Autism is mainly caused by a child\u2019s genes, a major study of British twins has found. Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King\u2019s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common (file picture) With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. Estimates suggest that as many as one in 100 people in the UK now has autism. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common. They found the condition was far more common in identical twins than in non-identical ones. The study, in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, concluded that rogue DNA explains between 74 and 98 per cent of the cause of the average case of autism. If genes are key, the recent rise in cases could be explained by more people being correctly diagnosed with the condition. Controversial research which linked autism with the MMR jab has now been widely discredited (file picture) Dr Francesca Happe told the BBC: \u2018Our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller, which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism. The main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition.\u2019 Dr Judith Brown, of the National Autistic Society, said: \u2018Autism is a highly complex story of genes not only interacting with other genes, but with non-genetic factors too. \u2018This large population-based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share.\u2019 But she added: \u2018We are still a long way from knowing what leads to autism. \u2018What people with the condition, their families and carers need most of all is access now to the right kind of support to be able to lead full lives.\u2019 The study looked at 128 pairs of twins in which at least one sibling had an autism diagnosis, between the ages of 12 and 14. Lead researcher Beata Tick said: \u2018This study shows that the genes are very important and the increased rate of autism is more down to awareness than environmental factors.\u2019 Latest figures suggest more than one in 100 people in Britain has autism, including related conditions such as Asperger\u2019s syndrome. This is a ten-fold increase on 30 years ago. Symptoms vary, but usually revolve around difficulty with social interaction, communication problems and a need for a strict routine. Many patients are treated with speech and behavioural therapy.

A struggling\u00a0university is paying up to \u00a3100,000 to send all 700 of its staff for stays at a luxury hotel. The breaks in the Lake District are being organised by the University of Bolton so its controversial vice-chancellor can give pep talks. Professor George Holmes, who was recently lent almost \u00a31million by the university so he could move house, owns a private yacht which is moored less than ten miles from the hotel. The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about \u00a3220 a night for a room with a view of the lake.

It has organised 20 breaks as part of its staff development programme. The first was in September and the last will be in May. Professor Holmes, a former adviser to Labour whose yacht is moored at a marina on Windermere, addresses each group \u2018engaging directly in dialogue in respect of the strategy\u2019. The university, which in 2013 was ranked worst in the country in two guides, said feedback from employees had so far been positive. But according to Times Higher Education, a source at the university said staff were \u2018amazed\u2019 by the scheme because it \u2018must cost a fortune\u2019. A university spokesman said it \u2018considers this an appropriate developmental investment in staff to underpin the growing strength of the university\u2019. The spokesman said it was part of a multi-million-pound investment in teaching and learning infrastructure, adding: \u2018For the avoidance of doubt, the yacht belongs to the vice-chancellor personally and is operated, maintained and moored at the vice-chancellor\u2019s own expense. \u2018The yacht is not university property and has no relevance to the university\u2019s current staff development programme taking place at the Lakeside Hotel.\u2019 The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa (pictured) on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about \u00a3220 a night for a room with a view of the lake. Last month, it was revealed that the University of Bolton gave Professor Holmes a two-year \u00a3960,000 loan to buy a house nearer the campus without him having to sell his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The move was to save him a 100-mile round-trip, allowing the 53-year-old, who took up his post in 2006, to \u2018play a greater role\u2019 in the university and the town.

Sandra Kay Bryant, 59, pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday in St. Louis to one felony count of aiding and abetting the use of fire to commit mail fraud. Bryant could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison in June. Sandra Kay Bryant, 59, pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday in St. Louis for her role in a 2001 blaze that killed the couple's 15-year-old son. She admitted to\u00a0one felony count of aiding and abetting the use of fire to commit mail fraud. Her ex-husband, Steven Kemper, pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2013 and will be sentenced next month. Investigators said the fire at the family's home in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant killed Zachariah Kemper after he became trapped in the basement he shared with his mother while her mother, Kemper and his lover lived upstairs. All of the adults escaped unharmed. According to prosecutors, Bryant set fire to a trash can in a basement utility room next to her son's bedroom, using hairspray to fuel the flames. Zachariah Kemper, 15, was killed during a fire his parents allegedly set in 2001 to commit mail fraud. The fire was supposed to look like the result of careless smoking and bad cleaning habits,\u00a0according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Bryant and Kemper knew their son was asleep in the next room, the indictment alleges. Firefighters found the boy's body near his bed. His arms were covering his head and face, and a fire extinguisher was on the floor, a few feet away. The teen sustained burns on his upper body, head and extremities, according to an autopsy that found soot in his airway, showing he was alive when the fire broke out. Bryant was initially charged in state court with an arson-related murder count, but she walked free after a judge declared a mistrial, barring Missouri prosecutors from going after her again. The judge in her original case, David Lee Vincent III allowed jurors to see video footage of Bryant's polygraph test but later changed his mind, triggering the mistrial. The federal indictment characterized the couple as greedy, cash-strapped schemers who once tried to torch the Alton, Illinois, home of Bryant's mother after secretly siphoning $30,000 from her bank accounts. Betty Bryant, who the indictment said also managed to escape a New Year's Day 1997 blaze authorities say Kemper had set in her St. Louis home as she slept, later denied the couple any more financial help while threatening to cut them out of her will. She died in 2007.

While driving home from the course on Wednesday, Joshua was being taken to a nearby hospital with what turned out to be a bout of pneumonia. It was past midnight before he was allowed home. \u2018It was certainly something of a blessing that I had a late tee-time,\u2019 said the Englishman, who posted five birdies in a round that left him just a stroke off the pace set by American Morgan Hoffman.

After 15 holes of his opening round, a small slice of history loomed for McIlroy, just three weeks shy of his attempt at a career grand slam at the Masters. The world number one was swinging so smoothly he had hit all 15 greens in regulation. Not once in any round in his PGA Tour career has he hit all 18. No-one had done so at Bay Hill since 1995.

He knew what was coming next. The ball bounced on the bank at the front of the green and back into one of the course\u2019s many water hazards. There ended any hope of hitting all 18 greens in regulation. At least on the positive side, there were obviously plenty of excellent blows in those first 15 holes, and the reason he was only two under par at the time was he couldn\u2019t buy a putt, which wouldn\u2019t have stressed him unduly given the shocking state of the Bay Hill greens.

{"article": "Evidence: Police officer David Duckenfield today admitted that he was not qualified to oversee the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 which ended in tragedy. The most senior police officer on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today apologised and admitted he was 'not the best man' for the task, adding that he was 'learning on the job'. Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield, the match commander, had little experience of policing football matches and had never been in charge during a game before. Giving evidence at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans today, he said it was a'serious mistake' not to consult with his predecessor about the challenges the match would pose, and apologised for 'failings' in the policing of the game. The supporters were crushed to death shortly after the start of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground on April 15, 1989. Mr Duckenfield, now 70, was a chief superintendent who was promoted to be head of the local police division two weeks before the game. He gave the order to open the gates to the ground in the minutes before the crush, allowing 2,000 fans to flood into the ground, and later wrongly claimed that a gate had been forced open. Speaking at the inquest in Warrington, Cheshire today, Mr Duckenfield was asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to do the job properly given his lack of experience. The former officer replied: 'All I would say is this, that after a period, I would say, I'm older, hopefully wiser - probably I was not the best man for the job on the day.' Mr Duckenfield said he had no recent previous experience of policing at Hillsborough before the match and his knowledge of the stadium was'very general.' Asked later how familiar he was with the ground, Mr Duckenfield said: 'With hindsight I can almost say, knowing the events of the day, I should've spent the majority of my time as the new commander down there. 'I did in the light of the information available what I considered necessary, and, if there was a failing, well, I apologise.' The officer agreed that while he had experience of public order policing, that was 'totally different' to policing football matches. He added: 'At the time I should have thought about my limited knowledge of the role of a commander at a major event that was a sell-out when I had not been in that responsible position previously.' Mr Duckenfield said that after first joining South Yorkshire Police as a cadet in 1960, he had been 'delighted' to be promoted to the post of chief superintendent of F Division of South Yorkshire Police - including Hillsborough - around March 1989. Inexperienced: Mr Duckenfield had only recently been promoted at the time of the match. Relatives: Campaigners Margaret Aspinall, left, and Jenni Hicks, right, pictured outside the inquest today. The witness told the jury the job came with other major responsibilities, as the area was also home to a major hospital, the local university and areas of affluence and deprivation. He said, while the semi-final game was 'obviously a major priority', it was only one of the priorities he had to deal with, adding: 'I only had 15 days, and that was not 15 working days.' Mr Duckenfield said his understanding of the job of the match commander was that he would not be involved in the day-to-day or minute-by-minute duties and would only become on the day if something went wrong. Christina Lambert QC asked him: 'Did it not occur to you before the match that it was a job that called for deep experience?' Mr Duckenfield said he had been 'assured' by his boss the chief constable he could rely on the other experienced officers in his team, though he had only had a single brief conversation with his predecessor, Brian Mole. Miss Lambert asked if he thought it was a mistake to accept the role and 'not seek the assistance from others such as Mr Mole?' He replied: 'There was a culture in the police service at that time and the culture was you would be moved without any overlap and you would learn, dare I say it, on the job. So it did not cross my mind to say, 'I'm not up to the job.' I just got on with it.' Miss Lambert continued: 'My question is, in hindsight, was it a mistake?' The witness replied: 'In hindsight, it was a serious mistake. I did know what the job involved, but no one, including me, knew what might evolve on the day.' Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground's perimeter fence. Mr Duckenfield said that it was necessary to keep rival fans apart from each other in order to ensure their safety, pointing to the culture of football hooliganism at the time. He said: 'The main objectives were safety and I align that with", "abstract": "David Duckenfield, the most senior police officer on duty during the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, has admitted that he was not qualified to oversee the FA Cup semi-final which ended in tragedy.

But Bobby Brown appeared on a talk show today selling his barbecue sauce - and saying that Bobbi Kristina was 'doing really well'. The pre-recorded segment of Queen Latifah was accompanied by a brief on-screen warning that the interview was 'previously recorded'. But it was not shown throughout the segment, which was broadcast on network affiliate stations around the country. Daily Mail Online has reached out to Sony Pictures, which produces the Queen Latifah show to ask why it was aired. Warning: Viewers were told briefly when Bobby brown arrived on the Queen Latifah show that it was made before his daughter was found drowned in her bath tub. In the course of his appearance,\u00a0Brown said that his daughter was 'great' and busy working on her music. He joked about how he doesn't like working out and said that Bobbi Kristina had 'the voice of her mother'. But the decision to air it regardless will be seen by many to be in bad taste. Bobbi Kristina is currently unconscious in an Atlanta hospital room after she was found unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31 in a chilling echo of how her mother Whitney Houston died. Her family have said she is'still fighting' but reports have claimed that she could suffer from serious brain damage if she ever manages to leave the hospital.

But since his daughter's drowning he has been at the hospital where she is fighting for her life. But on the Queen Latifah show he seemed relaxed and in good humor. With a smile on his face, Brown cooked some shrimp and rice for Latifah to show off his range of barbecue sauces, which he launched last summer. Brown said: 'Smell it! 'When you smell good food, that's when you go into a place to eat, when you can smell it from outside. Fresh peppers and herbs and garlic.' Asked how things are going with his family, Brown said: 'Everybody's great. 'Two of my sons are working on LPs. They drive me crazy, but, you know. They do their thing and I just stand to the side.

{"article": "Jerusalem (CNN)Either Benjamin Netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in Israeli history and beyond, or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election. Polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire, with Netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union party. Only four days before the election, polls showed Herzog taking a four-seat lead into the final weekend before the election. Exit polls on the night of the election showed Netanyahu had closed the gap. The polls suggested he was in a dead heat, with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties. Then came the results. Not more polls or surveys, but actual counts from the ballot boxes. Netanyahu wasn't in a fight for his political life after all. He was the clear winner, running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government. Although the results are unofficial, it seems almost certain that Netanyahu will remain the Israeli prime minister. Avi Degani, a pollster, professor at Tel Aviv University and president of the Geocartography Knowledge Group, saw very different results from his own polls. He never anticipated a Zionist Union victory. Instead, he says, he always saw Likud holding a lead. The mistake that others made, according to Degani, was in the methodology. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" he said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- Tel Aviv, better-educated, more participants in this kind of conversation. And people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote Likud, I think, are poorly represented.\" \"I have tested sometimes at the same night, doing by telephone as I do always -- and very specifically geographically, and very well-weighted and very well, having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time I did on the Internet. And I got results which are very, very different.\" But Mina Tzemach, the polling expert for CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel, suggests Netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap \"like a magician,\" using the election polls as his final trick. \"The polls showed that they are going to lose. It gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians. Netanyahu used it,\" said Tzemach. \"Many voted what we call strategic voting. They did not vote to the party that is their first preference, but they voted for the Likud.\" Likud voters did not participate in exit polls, according to Tzemach, and that skewed the results, leading many to believe that Herzog had tied Netanyahu. \"We had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former Soviet Union,\" explained Tzemach. \"In these ballots, more than 30% did not participate in our polls, and they are Likud supporters.\" Another factor that may have worked in Netanyahu's favor was his Likud party cannibalizing votes from other right-wing parties. In the days before the election, Netanyahu moved to the political right, making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties, such as Naftali Bennett's Jewish Home party and Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party. During the weekend before the election, Netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square. He continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election. His most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution. \"Anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel,\" he said in a television interview. \"This is the true reality that was created here in the last few years.\" In 2009, in a speech known as the Bar Ilan speech, Netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution, saying, \"Let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions. Israel is committed to international agreements, and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations. I say to the Palestinians: We want to live with you in peace, quiet, and good neighborly relations.\" Tzemach estimates that Likud took four seats from Jewish Home and two more seats from Yachad, a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Exit polls in Israel have been wrong before. In the most recent elections in 2013, exit polls showed Yair Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the Knesset. But when the final results were tallied, Lapid won 19 seats, becoming a major player in the", "abstract": "The recent Israeli election results have left many pollsters and experts scratching their heads. Polls leading up to the election showed a tight race between Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger, Isaac Herzog, with Herzog even taking a four-seat lead just four days before the election. However, when the actual votes were counted, Netanyahu won by a clear margin, leading some to question the accuracy of polling methods. Some experts suggest that the polls were skewed towards the center and did not accurately represent the views of those in the periphery who tend to vote for Likud. Others suggest that Netanyahu's shift to the right and his appeal to right-wing voters may have played a role in his victory."}

The attack Thursday on Mark Lippert, which prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves. It also raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death. Scroll down for video. On the mend: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage  after a man attacked him with a knife during a lecture in Seoul. Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against anti-U.S. activist Kim Ki-jong (above) who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification. Lippert, 42, was recovering well but still complaining of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved. Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood. In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly yelled 'North Korea and South Korea should be unified' before he attacked Ambassador Lippert at the breakfast meeting. Seen above being taken into custody on Thursday. Journalists question Kim, who was brought out in a wheelchair, as he left the police station for a court in Seoul earlier today. They want to charge Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction, and have requested a formal detention warrant. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathising with the North Korean government, was being considered. But the 55-year-old has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea \u2014 seven times between 1999 and 2007 \u2014 during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. Protest: South Korean officials responded swiftly in response to the attacks, beefing up security outside the U.S. Embassy and promising justice. Above, a group of South Korean protesters burn North Korean flags in Seoul during a rally denouncing the attack on Thursday. Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong U.S. military presence.

Against the North: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left, during a rally denouncing the attack on the U.S. ambassador on Thursday. Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday \u2014 exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the U.S. presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops here, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said.

This is the eminent dealer who sold art to Paul McCartney, and hosted John Lennon and Yoko Ono's first joint exhibition; the Savile Row-clad Etonian whose Mayfair galleries attracted the likes of Marlon Brando, Marianne Faithfull and William Burroughs in the 60s and 80s; the silver-tongued heroin addict who introduced Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat to Britain, and was arrested -- and, in his case, imprisoned -- for drug possession with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards during the 1967 Redlands Bust. Curated by the artist Brian Clarke, A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel, the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s. \"There are oceans of anecdotes by Robert, and some of them are true. But the anecdote isn't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had, this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy,\" says Clarke, arguably the world's most well known stained glass artist. I first met Clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage-cum-mansion in London's tony Notting Hill neighborhood. A literal portrait of Fraser painted by Basquiat hangs prominently in the living room, surrounded by works by Warhol, Francis Bacon and others. Clarke, who was a close friend of Fraser's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery, is still finalizing the exhibition selection, but his energy is easy, if a little manic. Harriet Vyner, a long-time friend of Clarke and Fraser, and author of the Fraser biography Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser, has been collaborating with him on the catalog. She's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean. \"I remember going to Seditionaries, (Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's 70s punk shop) on the King's Road, and it felt a bit scary, but that was part of the thrill,\" she says. \"And that's what people often felt about going to the Robert Fraser gallery in both incarnations.\" The idea for the portrait came from Pace London's managing director Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst a year ago, when Clarke told her he'd been entrusted with Fraser's archive. (Fraser died of AIDS-related illness in 1986 at the age of 49.) \"The 'light bulb moment' really struck when we realized that Pace founder, Arne Glimcher, was setting up his first gallery in Boston at the time Fraser was opening his own gallery in London,\" Dent-Brocklehurst writes in an email. \"We're exploring our own DNA with this exhibition while paying tribute to one of the most flamboyant dealers and aesthetes. \"There's a buzz in London right now around the exhibition and many artists, museum directors, celebrities, aspiring artists, art students are all very keen to rediscover Robert's personality.\" To hear Clarke speak about Fraser is to have assumptions alternately challenged, rebuked and confirmed. He makes no excuses and offers no explanations for Fraser's \"more hedonistic side,\" but emphasizes his generally quiet demeanor and modesty. The overall impression is of someone with an acute eye for talent (he showed Bacon, Warhol, Dennis Hopper, Richard Hamilton, Jim Dine, Robert Mapplethorpe and Jean Dubuffet) and a rebellious, destructive streak. This is reflected in the exhibition itself, which is set up like an archive. Works from the luminaries Fraser knew, showed or admired are on the walls, while personal effects -- a thank-you note from Ed Ruscha, a Sex Pistols Never Mind the Boll", "abstract": "London's Royal Academy is hosting an exhibition of the work of Robert Fraser, a gallerist who was a seminal part of the Swinging Sixties scene.

{"article": "Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study has warned. Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study warns today. It found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed. Paracetamol is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin, which can cause stomach bleeds, and ibuprofen, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. But British researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug\u2019s safety. They think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called COX-2. Scientists from the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years, for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain. They also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all. Philip Conaghan, who led the research, pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early. For this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems. But the professor added: \u2018I am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we hadn\u2019t previously associated.\u2019 He said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments, such as exercise. Published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the study concluded: \u2018Given its high usage and availability, a systematic review of paracetamol\u2019s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted.\u2019 Professor Conaghan said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person\u2019s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed, for those who took the drug for longer periods. Statistically, one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks, strokes and other complications of heart disease. Other scientists played down the risks. Professor Nick Bateman, who specialises in clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u2018Based on this study the risk is minimal. Paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available, and this study should not stop people taking it. \u2018Based on these results, the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised, this is common sense for all medicines.\u2019 Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in the UK and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year. A further 200million packs are sold over the counter. Although the NHS does not keep figures, evidence from Canada suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year. A 2013 Oxford study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug, three would suffer a heart attack within a year, of which one would be fatal.", "abstract": "A new study warns that daily paracetamol could increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death.

{"article": "A boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new  trial. Jordan Brown, now 17, was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and her unborn son with a shotgun in February 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room. The court heard Houk, then eight months pregnant, was sleeping when Brown approached her with a blanket-covered 20-gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head. However, Brown's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement. 'Rush judgement': Jordan Brown (pictured left aged 14), was convicted of shooting his father's fiancee Keznie Houk (right) when she was eight months pregnant and sleeping. He claims the evidence was insubstantial. Shock: His father Chris Brown (pictured) spoke out about his shock after the attack when the boy was just 11. Filing for retrial on Thursday, defense attorney Steve Colafella said: 'I think the trial court has, at a minimum, no choice but to give us a new trial. 'We feel strongly there was just not enough evidence to convict him beyond reasonable doubt and are confident of an acquittal.' The state Supreme Court first raised questions about the case in December. Jordan Brown's defense attorneys said both sides were asked to file written arguments before the judge issues a final ruling in a few weeks and that they expect a favorable ruling. State prosecutors did not immediately comment following the closed hearing in Lawrence County. State police and prosecutors have repeatedly said none of the evidence points to anyone but Brown, who is now 17. The defense contends the investigation amounted to a rush to judgment against the boy, fueled in part by Houk's family. They have told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who, they contend, was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse in Wampum, about 40 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Tragic: Houk left behind a seven-year-old Jenessa (left) and a four-year-old Adalynn (right) Brown's defense lawyers claim Houk's family fueled animosity towards Brown during the 2012 trial. Brown's attorneys claim he was the victim of a rush judgement. Prosecutors contend Brown approached Houk with his youth-model 20-gauge shotgun hidden under a blanket then shot her in the back of the head as she lay in bed. She was more than 8 months pregnant with a son, who also died. Brown's father had left for work and Houk's two daughters, ages 7 and 4, were the only others in the house when she was shot, prosecutors said. An empty shotgun shell was found on the long driveway between the house and the road, where Brown walked before a school bus picked him up that morning, and police said they found gunshot residue on his clothes and no male footprints leading to or from the house except for Brown's. But Colafella said pictures from the scene show a'muddy mess' outside the house that doesn't clearly show what footprints were and were not there and that police did not thoroughly canvass four entrances to the home to see whether someone else could have come in. 'Jealousy': Jordan was allegedly jealous that his father's new son was going to be named Chris after him. The defense also said Brown frequently shot his gun and that gun powder residue found on his clothes that day could have come from a winter jacket he had also worn during a turkey shoot days earlier. Police have said Houk's ex-boyfriend was eliminated as a suspect by their investigation, but the Supreme Court noted defense arguments that Jordan saw a truck resembling the man's near the house that morning. Colafella also said Houk's seven-year-old daughter first told police she didn't hear anything unusual that morning, only to later recall hearing a loud bang after additional questioning. Houk's body was found after the four-year-old went outside to tell men hired to cut trees that she thought her mother was dead, police said. Jack Houk, the dead woman's father, did not immediately return a call seeking comment after the hearing. The defense has told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who they contend was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse.", "abstract": "Jordan Brown, who was convicted of fatally shooting his father's pregnant fiancee when he was just 11 years old, has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new trial.

An A list celebrity might spend \u00a329 on a Wagyu burger at London\u2019s Dorchester Hotel \u2013 after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence. Alternatively, you could try the local Aldi, where the budget chain is introducing Wagyu burgers at \u00a32.99 each. The budget chain is to offer a limited stock of Wagyu burgers made with beef imported from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers. Normally, luxury restaurants, stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering \u00a3100 per kilo \u2013 so putting it out of reach for most families. However, Aldi is bringing the beef, which originated with pampered cattle in Japan, to the masses. Last year the company sold Wagyu sirloin and rib-eye steaks at \u00a36.99 each, which resulted in something of a stampede among the BMW-driving classes. It believes the burgers will be similarly successful. Wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat, which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture. The cattle were initially introduced to Japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century. Beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite, while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in Japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around. Kobe beef is the purest, highest quality of the meat, which is produced from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition. However, the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe, including the UK and New Zealand. Beef from\u00a0Wagyu cows is sold for as much as\u00a0\u00a3100 per kilo in luxury restaurants\u00a0and gourmet butchers. Aldi said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the Oscars ball. Stars such as Bradley Cooper, Eddie Redmayne and Julianne Moore were amongst the 1,500 members of Hollywood royalty to dine at infamous Governors Ball, where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu. The chain\u2019s managing director of corporate buying, Tony Baines, said: \u2018At Aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products, and Wagyu is no exception. Following the frenzy around the Wagyu steaks Aldi sold last summer, we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers. Following his Oscar success, Eddie Redmayne dined at the\u00a0Governors Ball where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu. \u2018Aldi\u2019s Specially Selected Wagyu Burgers are made from premium quality Wagyu beef, and are available at an everyday low price, which our customers have come to know and love.\u2019 At the Dorchester Bar, the \u00a329 Wagyu burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise. Aldi suggests teaming its version with its Specially Selected Brioche Burger Buns, which are 99p for four, and a pack of Roquefort cheese, which is \u00a32.29. That would give a price for the Aldi version of less than \u00a34 \u2013 assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese.", "abstract": "Aldi is introducing Wagyu burgers at \u00a32.99 each, made with beef imported from New Zealand, in a bid to chase middle and high-income shoppers.

At least nine people were killed in the initial blast, while an unknown number of government officials remain trapped inside the building amid sporadic exchanges of gunfire, officials have said. While the hotel, located in Somalia's capital, is popular with government officials, it remains unclear who is being targeted in the attack. However, Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility. Scroll down for video. Two locals carry a wounded boy from the scene of the suicide bombing in Mogadishu today. A hotel guest desperately tries to make his way to the roof of the hotel as militants storm the building. Police and security forces stand guard at the scene of the car bombing as they exchange gunfire with militants inside the building. Somali police take aim as they walk outside the Hotel Maka Al-Mukaram, where an unknown number of people are being held hostage. A Somali man stands next to the wreckage of a car a suicide bomber used to kill at least nine people. Two men badly injured in the bomb blast are helped by a local amid the chaos of the attack. The attack started when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden car at the gate of the hotel today. Gunmen then quickly moved in. Police captain Mohamed Hussein said he had counted at least nine bodies at the scene, and the death toll is likely to rise. Al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab has issued a statement taking responsibility for the blitz. 'We are behind the Hotel Maka Al Mukaram attack, and fighting is still going on inside,' the group's military spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab said. Police surrounded the Hotel Maka Al Mukaram, but heavy gunfire from militants prevented them from mounting a rescue operation. The remains of two destroyed cars could be seen at the gates of the building. 'The hotel is now fully under the control of the militants,' Major Ismail Olow, a Mogadishu police officer at the scene, said. 'Al Shabaab fighters are on the top of the building and inside the hotel. It is not easy for us to go in.' Two policemen take up positions near the hotel during their shootout with al-Shabaab extremists. Police officials peer into the hotel complex after a suicide bomber destroyed its gates earlier today. Al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab regularly carries out attacks in the Somali capital in a bid to unseat the country's Western-backed government. Two police officers take cover behind a wall of the hotel's exterior during the standoff with the militants. Locals lower a man onto a stretcher after he was injured in the deadly bomb last which killed nine. Soldiers and policemen carry a woman from the scene amid a hail of gunfire. Al-Shabaab routinely carries out suicide bombings, drive-by shootings and other attacks in Mogadishu, the seat of Somalia's Western-backed government. The militants have continued to launch attacks in Mogadishu despite being ousted from their bases in the seaside city in 2011. Al Shabaab was pushed out of the capital by African peacekeeping forces, but have waged a series of gun and grenade attacks, looking to overthrow the government and impose its strict version of sharia law on the country. An offensive launched last year by African Union forces along with the Somali army has driven the group out of its strongholds in central and southern Somalia, while a series of U.S. drone strikes have killed some of its top leaders. Despite the military campaign, al Shabaab has continued to strike back with often devastating effect using hit-and-run bomb and gun attacks in the capital Mogadishu and other towns. It has also struck out at countries supporting the African Union mission. Security forces discuss how best to tackle the hostage situation which broke out earlier this afternoon.

Katie launched an attack on Danny's partner Joanne Mas, saying: 'no\u00a0woman should ever propose to a man,' to which the EastEnders star responded: 'I agree...especially when you look like ya face should be on the side of a gothic building,' and calling her sexist. But a post-graduate English student who proposed to her boyfriend using a personalised pint glass tells FEMAIL that Katie's notions of marriage are outdated. Katy Miller, 24, and Tim O\u2019Brien, 29, who are from Texas but currently live in Portugal, had been dating for several years before she decided to take the plunge last April. She said: 'My partner and I first met at an Irish pub in Texas. 'We both very much enjoy drinking craft beer, visiting breweries, and sampling the local beers in every city (and country) we visit.' She continued: 'I knew he would love it if I tied this common interest into a proposal, so I picked a quiet craft beer pub in a residential area of Dublin to bring things full circle. 'I was a graduate student in Manchester at the time, so Ireland wasn\u2019t very far away. 'I had a pint glass etched with \u2018Tim, after you finish this pint, I\u2019m going to ask you a question\u2026\u2019 on the side, while the bottom that he\u2019d see after downing the pint said \u2018\u2026will you marry me?\u2019 The pint glass that Katy commissioned for her proposal to boyfriend Tim. Tim was delighted with the proposal and immediately said yes, with the pair choosing to elope just a few months later. They said their handwritten vows on a hilltop in a quiet village on the\u00a0island of Mallorca, which Katy describes as, 'One of the happiest moments of our lives.' Katy is proud of her decision to propose to Tim and believes that Ms Hopkins' views on marriage are outdated. She said: 'There are things of real importance women do every day that are cause for actual celebration. 'A woman proposing to a man is not one of them, and I wish it were such an unremarkable event that we never felt the need to discuss it or to defend ourselves. 'Unfortunately, that is not the case, particularly not in the southern US where we are from.' Etched onto the bottom of the pint glass was the question 'Will you marry me?' While Katy and Tim's close friends and family were delighted at their happy news, she does admit that there was a backlash for more small minded people. She reveals: 'People asked if it was an April Fools joke (it was April 16th) and asked me if the proposal was actually for real. 'Acquaintances of my partner had a hard time understanding the concept, and we heard the phrase \u2018real man\u2019 tossed around, as if a \u2018real man\u2019 isn\u2019t any man. 'But the main source of awkward interactions was my lack of an engagement ring.' Katie Hopkins and Danny Dyer got into a Twitter row yesterday after the reality star criticised the actor's girlfriend for proposing to him. Katy believes that in order for us to move into a fully equal society, issues like who proposes to who shouldn't even be a topic of conversation. She said: 'This narrative of men always proposing and that being the only option is incredibly dull. 'When it comes to relationships, everyone should do what is best for them; however, I refuse to believe that following a man\u2019s lead is what\u2019s best for every single woman. 'Perhaps some women, like me, want to make romantic gestures to their partner. 'Obviously there are far more important feminist issues in society than who is proposing to whom, but if we\u2019re going to speak out against gender roles, then why has this antiquated tradition remained so firmly in place? 'Instead, there\u2019s this stigma where people see a woman who proposes as someone who is tired of waiting around for the man to do it.

Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and t-shirts to project the mood. The Paris Saint-Germain squad are put through their paces at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho addresses the media ahead of their return clash against Paris Saint-Germain. There will be posters, banners and flags showcasing Chelsea's stance against racism at Stamford Bridge. There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That\u2019s the way we like it.' There will be t-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'. Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands.

Souleymane S has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend Wednesday night's Champions League tie. Five of the Chelsea fans involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches. Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated. Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early nineties, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad. Paul Canoville, the club\u2019s first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for the Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan. Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before the game against PSG. 'It\u2019s a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It\u2019s a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football\u2019s authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.'", "abstract": "Chelsea fans are taking action against racism within the club, following the incident on the Paris Metro where Chelsea supporters refused to let Souleymane S board a train and sang racist chants. Fans are producing flags, banners, posters and t-shirts to project the message that there is no place for racism at Stamford Bridge. The initiative has gained support from fans at home and abroad, and aims to send a message to the world that Chelsea is not a racist club."}

Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence that occurred two days before the former footballer tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry. The 35-year-old, still bearing the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January, spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London. The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman, who played for Leeds United, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted a Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner, prosecutor Zahid Hussain said. Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle that he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14. She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation. He had been spotted by police'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting a lorry on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am. Mr Hussain said the car was seen'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'. When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle, 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt in February with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital. He said he was 'disgusted' with himself and told family members he 'did not want to be here' when they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. 'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me,' he said. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you 'I still do not want to be here'.

{"article": "It has famously been a showcase for fast cars, flash watches and high-class liquor - but the latest Bond instalment is set to go one step further by promoting an entire country for tax-breaks. The new movie, Spectre, will be a truly pro-Mexican affair with beautiful shots of the country, a leading role for one of the nation's most glamorous actress and a strict rule that Bond's nemesis is not from Mexico. In exchange for these considerable lengths, the Hollywood producers making the film, who are under pressure to cut their huge budget, will have an extra \u00a314million to spend how they choose. Scroll down for video. Starring role: Glamorous Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman was recently unveiled as new Bond girl Estrella. The Central American country, where the iconic opening scene takes place, offered Hollywood producers a fortune as an incentive to film there, but their generosity came with conditions. Stephanie Sigman, one of Mexico's rising stars, was recently unveiled as Bond girl Estrella, appearing alongside Italian Monica Bellucci, who plays Lucia Sciarra. The Mexican actress, 27, is best known for her role in the award-winning Mexican film Miss Bala, in which she played a beauty queen forced to do a gang's dirty work after witnessing a murder. In addition, Mexico also asked that an assassination target in the film, the Mayor of Mexico City, be changed to an international leader, The Telegraph reports. Tax incentives: It is believed that Hollywood producers making the new Bond movie will save as much as \u00a314million by showing Mexico in a favourable light. These measures are said to have secured tax breaks worth \u00a310million. Around \u00a34million was said to have been earned by filming flattering shots of the country's'modern' skyline and replacing a cage fighting scene with footage of Mexico's renowned Day of the Dead festivities. Stephanie Sigman will be the first Mexican-born Bond girl on the big screen, but not the first overall. Mexico's Linda Christian - the original Bond girl - starred in the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale. The movie's alterations were reported by US website Tax Analysts, which provides information on tax news, based on emails leaked in last year's Sony hacking scandal. Large numbers of internal emails were released by Guardians of the Peace, which the FBI has since identified as a North Korean-backed group of hackers. According to the leaked emails Spectre's budget was at one point exceeding \u00a3200 million - which would have made it one of the most expensive films in history. Studio executives spoke of being under 'immense pressure' to reduce the budget. The plan to give Mexico a flattering portrayal was outlined in a memo titled 'Elements needed to preserve Mexican deal'. It spoke of how producers should cast a 'known Mexican actress' as Estrella and female villain Sciarra 'cannot be Mexican'. It also called for aerial shots of'modern Mexico City buildings'. Rising star: Ms Sigman (pictured left in an advert for her hit Mexican film Miss Bala) will star alongside Daniel Craig and Italian actress Monica Bellucci, who\u00a0who plays Lucia Sciarra. Another condition:\u00a0Other leaked Sony emails suggested Bond producers were asked to film shots with Mexico's'modern' skyline in the background. Other emails suggested the Mayor of Mexico City should no longer be assassinated while it was decided Bond would steal Sciarra's helicopter and take off 'into the Mexican skyline'. A senior studio executive later wrote to producers saying: 'You have done a great job in getting us the Mexican incentive. 'By all accounts we can still get the extra $6M by continuing to showcase the modern aspects of the city, and it sounds like we are well on our way based on your last scout. Let's continue to pursue whatever avenues we have available to maximise this incentive.' In an email Amy Pascal, the former co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment, added: 'We should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in Mexico to get the extra money.' Sony Pictures Entertainment has not  commented on the Mexico tax incentives. The new film, set to be released in the autumn, had \u00a0budget exceeding \u00a3200million, which would have made it one of the most expensive movies in history.", "abstract": "The latest James Bond film, Spectre, will promote Mexico in exchange for tax breaks worth \u00a310m, with the country's modern skyline and Day of the Dead festivities replacing a cage fighting scene.

Al-Taqwa College Principal Omar Hallak reportedly shows his almost 2,000 students \u2018evidence\u2019 that Islamic State terrorists are \u2018not linked to Islam\u2019. \u2018We don\u2019t believe Muslims are creating IS,\u2019 Mr Hallak told The Age. He believes that the murder and brutality carried out by Islamic State terrorists is actually a plot by Western countries to control oil in the Middle East. The school, which is based in Melbourne\u2019s outer-west, Victoria, is focussed on educating Australian Muslims that \u2018follow Australian Law\u2019, he said. \u2018In the mosque, we talk to them many times. We show them evidence it's not linked to Islam,\u2019 Mr Hallak explained. Al-Taqwa College Principal Omar Hallak reportedly tells his pupils that Islamic State is a plot manufactured by Western countries. He said his Islamic school in Melbourne doesn't have problem with radicalisation. The principle\u2019s belief that IS is simply a plot caused by Israel and America stems from his theory that the terrorists use \u2018shiny new equipment\u2019. Al-Taqwa College is an independent primary and secondary school. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Hallak for comment. A spokesman for the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia\u00a0Keysar Trad\u00a0told Fairfax Radio on Monday the principle was just trying to discourage young people from joining the terror group. 'I can understand anyone taking offence to being in any way implicated in the type of crimes that IS has been reported to have done,' Mr Trad said. 'But in the bigger picture scheme of things, the real issues are that we have to find as many ways as possible to convince young people to keep away from this group and have negative feelings towards this group.' Instead of criticising the principal for blaming the West, Mr Trad said the principal should be told 'we appreciate what you're doing, but we don't need the \"us and them\" approach'. Abdullah Elmir, a 17-year-old Australian who went missing from his home in Sydney\u2019s west at the end of June 2014, is fighting with Islamic State terrorists. Mr Trad said IS had done an 'unprecedented level of damage' to the image of Islam. He said there was a minority view that it was 'a plot from forces outside of Islam', either the West or Syria's Asad regime. Mr Hallak's remarks come after more than 100 Australians are thought to have flown to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State terrorists so far. Radicalised teens include Abdullah Elmir, a 17-year-old Australian who went missing from his home in Sydney\u2019s west at the end of June 2014, and Melbourne school boy Jake Bilardi. The 18-year-old died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week after travelling to Iraq with a \u2018death wish\u2019 last year after dropping out of school. Schoolboy Jake Bilardi was killed in a suicide bomb in Iraq last week after becoming radicalised online in Melbourne. On Sunday night his devastated father John Bilardi told 60 Minutes that it was clear his son suffered from psychological problems from an early age, but that they were never properly addressed, despite the fact all the warning signs were there. 'I would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me. He was my son. I knew there was something not right with his behaviour,' he said. The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. 'Just out of the blue he said, \"I've gone Muslim\",' his father said. 'To see him sitting there with that gun... I just couldn't believe that was my son,' Mr Bilardi said about the photograph of his son holding a rifle, flanked by other IS members, in front of the terrorist group\u2019s black and white flag.

{"article": "Australian kids suffering the effects of autism are getting a helping paw from assistance dogs. Asperger's syndrome and other disorders on the autism spectrum often make it hard for sufferers to recognise mainstream social cues and form friendships. But new research shows dogs can provide love, empathy and companionship that is hard for autism sufferers to recognise, and help kids like Jason Freeman, 11, make connections with the world. 'He is like a therapist, a very furry therapist,' said Jason's mum, Tanya Freeman. Scroll down for video. Best friends: Brock is a Golden Retriever who was specially trained by Assistance Dogs Australia to give kids like Jason the love, empathy and companionship that they wouldn't normally get from their peers. Brock is a Golden Retriever who was specially trained by Assistance Dogs Australia to give kids like Jason the love, empathy and companionship that they wouldn't normally get from their peers. New research has revealed children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can benefit from  animal-assisted activities. This means having a dog like Brock around can help improve the social skills of autistic children.. Assistance dogs have been proven to increase independence, reduce reliance on human caregivers and act as a great ice-breaker helping overcome social isolation. Around 230,000 Australians are estimated to have disorders on the autism spectrum like Asperger's, and as a result will struggle to understand normal social cues and body language, making it far more difficult to form friendships. Assistance Dogs Australia currently support 55 families with autistic children across Australia and while you might instantly think of assistance dogs performing physical tasks, Ms Freeman said Brock's role is far more related to emotional support. 'If Jason comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him, Brock will be right there with him.' 'Jason doesn't have the ability to read others or really have a real grasp on what people are thinking from body language which is something people really take for granted,' she said. Assistance Dogs Australia paired Brock and Jason in 2012 and since then they have formed a special bond. Ms Freeman said Jason's first few years of school were really tough on him. \u00a0He didn't have the chance to make many real friends and would sometimes come home in tears. 'Having a connection with others is hard for him but it's harder to see him not having the friendships that a lot of other kids do.' This was until Jason met Brock. She said once Brock came into their lives 'everything changed'. Brock and Jason had an' immediate connection' and it didn't take long for Brock to become 'part of the family'. 'If Jason comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him, Brock will be right there with him. 'He puts his paw up on his legs and just makes him feel like everything is alright,' she added. Ms Freeman said Brock is'very intuitive' to Jason's needs and that even if he is crying Brock knows exactly how to give him the emotional support that will calm him down. Brock has given Jason the confidence to interact with other people which seemed insurmountable  before his furry therapist came along. Jason has flourished since being given responsibility that comes with being a dog owner. It's his job to keep Brock fed, groomed and walked. Jason's younger brother Dylan has also been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and although their relationship can be strained at times she said it's given Jason a chance to teach his brother about trust and relationships. Brock has given brothers Dylan, left, and Jason, right, an opportunity to bond now they have found some common ground. 'Because they both have Asperger's, they both struggle in the same social situations. The two boys are pretty full on but Brock can bring the whole tone down.' She said Brock has a natural ability to read the anxiety and stress levels in the house and always knows when to come up and say: 'Hey, I'm here and it's going to be okay.' Jason now let's Dylan feed Brock and while they used to rub each other the wrong way she said they've found common ground with the newest member of the family. Ms Freeman said Brock's presence has  'benefited the whole family'. Even when things get too much for Ms Freeman, her 'furry therapist' is always there to comfort her. She said one of the most challenging parts of having a child with autism is watching your child in pain knowing there's nothing you can say to take it away, but now she said she has a lot more 'peace of mind' knowing Brock can fix any problem her kids are faced with. Animal-assisted activities provide a relatively simple and cost-effective means of helping families improve the social functioning of children with autism. Assistance Dogs start their training at eight weeks and won't graduate until they are about two years old.

General Raymond Odierno warned that the cuts could diminish Britain\u2019s ability to fight future campaigns. He also called on the Government to maintain defence spending at the Nato target of two per cent of national income. Scroll down for video. Head of the US Army General Raymond Odierno, who has warned that cuts to Britain's defence spending could diminish their ability to fight future campaigns. General Odierno, the US army chief of staff, suggested defence cuts had already damaged America\u2019s confidence in their military ally. I would be lying to you if I did not say that I am very concerned about the GDP investment in the UK,\u2019 he told The Daily Telegraph. \u2018We have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together. It is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do. \u2018What has changed, though, is the level of capability. In the past we would have a British Army division working alongside an American army division. Now it might be a British brigade inside an American division.\u2019 His warning came after the former head of the Army said yesterday that fresh cuts to Britain\u2019s Armed Forces would be \u2018unwise\u2019 with the West facing twin dangers of a new Cold War with Russia and the rise of Islamist extremism. Sir Peter Wall (left) and former Defence Secretary (right) are among those to have spoken out against the Chancellor's plan to reduce military spending to below the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP. In his first interview since retiring last September, General Sir Peter Wall admitted that he doubted UK politicians had the will to \u2018tackle the really wicked issues\u2019 facing the world. And the ex-Chief of the General Staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election. He said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training, equipment and even military missions \u2013 further undermining the UK\u2019s global standing. The Prime Minister has faced criticism over the cuts which, say experts, would 'comfort enemies' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Peter urged: 'We military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment. 'Implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the Nato summit in Wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody's responsibility around Europe to meet the 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, implicit in that is the fact that that's what we ought to be doing ourselves.' His views were echoed by former Defence Secretary Liam Fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds. 'To say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of GDP for international aid but not willing to implement our commitments in terms of defence, I think a lot of Conservatives would find that very difficult to swallow especially at a time when you can see the international security environment is deteriorating,' he told the BBC'S Andrew Neil. 'What is happening at the moment with, for example, Putin's Russia, is really only one miscalculation away from creating an Article 5 crisis that brings conflict to the European continent.' He was referring to the NATO article which considers an attack on one of its members an attack on all 28. Dr Fox added the relationship between Britain and America had been compromised following Parliament's voting against intervening in Syria following the regime's reported use of chemical weapons. 'I think there was damage done to Britain's relationship with the US at least to an extent when Parliament voted not to take action over the Syrian use of chemical weapons. During a recent visit to Washington Mr Cameron was told by President Barack Obama that reducing Britain's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty. 'I think there's a real danger here which is (that) you shouldn't make threats which you're not willing to follow through on. 'If you draw red lines, as President Obama did, and don't follow them through, that only gives comfort to your enemies.' David Cameron was among world leaders who pressed other member countries into meeting the 2 per cent target of military spending at the summit in Wales last year. However recent reports revealed the Government planned to lower spending to 1.8 per cent. President Obama last month insisted Britain live up to the agreed amount or it would face weakening NATO. During a visit to Washington he told David Cameron that anything less than 2 per cent would seek to undermine the treaty. Only four countries are thought to have met the quota in the past. They are the US, Britain, Estonia and Greece.", "abstract": "The head of the US army, General Raymond Odierno, has expressed concern over cuts to Britain's defence spending, warning that they could diminish Britain's ability to fight future campaigns.

Only 48 per cent now back the death penalty for \u2018some crimes\u2019, down from 54 per cent in 2013, according to a NatCen British Social Attitudes study. It is the first time that support has fallen below 50 per cent since NatCen began asking the public for its views on capital punishment in 1986.

The survey also found that at present Ukip voters are more likely to support the death penalty, with 75 per cent in favour. Rachel Ormston, co-head of social attitudes at NatCen, said: \u201cThe big change in public attitudes to the death penalty came in the 1990s at a time when attitudes to a range of other issues, like same-sex relationships and sex before marriage were also liberalising. \u201cThis more recent change is interesting because attitudes have stayed fairly steady for a number of years. \u201cIt could be the continuation of this liberalising trend or, perhaps, a response to the shocking botched executions in the United States that were widely reported in April and July of last year.\u201d Clare Algar, executive director of the legal charity Reprieve, said: \u201cThis welcome finding finally debunks the myth that, given half the chance, the British people would vote to bring back hanging. \u201cIn fact, the trend is clear.

{"article": "Mary-Ann Wood, 53, has one leg which weighs two stone more than the other after cancer treatment. A grandmother has spoken of the agony of living with a medical condition that means she has one leg two stone heavier than another. Mary-Ann Wood's left leg began to swell after treatment for cervical cancer 17 years ago, but it is now so huge that her calf has a circumference of almost 3ft. The 53-year-old suffers from lymphoedema, a condition where the body's plumbing goes haywire. This means fluid doesn't drain properly, leaving her with a painfully swollen leg. Mrs Wood is now unable to bend her leg, is barely able to walk, and doctors have said she will be completely immobile in less than a decade. Despite this, she has been denied NHS funding for a liposuction operation to drain the fluid from her leg. She made the bid through her doctor, who agreed she would benefit from the treatment, which would cost the NHS \u00a311,000. But after her case was assessed by a panel at her local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), her application was denied as the CCG said the evidence for the procedure's effectiveness was 'poor'. She claims she has been given several reasons as to why she can't have the treatment, including it being a 'cosmetic procedure'. Mrs Wood, of Midhurst, West Sussex, has been forced to give up her job working with special needs children while she continues to battle the NHS for the treatment. Last month, she was rejected by the Independent Complaint Advocacy on the grounds that her case is not 'exceptional enough', she said. Mrs Wood said: 'My leg is huge and the surgeon told me the only option is to have the operation. 'I've had loads of different excuses for being rejected - they once even said it would be \"cosmetic\". 'I was also told that I wasn't \"exceptional enough\" to get the op. It's ridiculous. She added: 'I was told that my best bet of getting the operation is to move to an area where the NHS provides it - it's a postcode lottery. 'But I've got two small grandchildren down the road I don't want to up sticks.' Mrs Wood's condition developed because she had lymph nodes removed along with her cervix as part of a hysterectomy. Her lymphatic system is no longer strong enough to drain her leg of the fluid causing the build-up. The lymphatic system is a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood. Normally, fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes. These nodes act like filter stations that process the waste - the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation. However, if the lymphatic system is faulty - such as after cancer treatment - the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up. The skin becomes like a soggy mattress, because there's too much fluid in the tissue. Mrs Wood Doctors calculated that her left leg was two stone heavier than her right leg using computer modelling. She said: 'The doctor knows how much the lymph fluid weighs so she measures my legs at 2cm intervals, works out the difference in size and puts it all into the computer and it calculates the difference in weight.' She must now wear a compression garment, which puts pressure on tissues to stop fluid build-up and encourage fluid to drain. The liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again. Mrs Wood's left leg has swollen so much her calf now has a circumference of almost three feet. She is unable to bend it, leaving her barely able to walk. Doctors have said she will be immobile within a decade. She suffers from lymphoedema, a condition in which the body's lymphatic system doesn't drain fluid properly from the leg, causing fluid to accumulate in the tissue and the leg to swell up. It would cost the NHS \u00a311, 000, with a continuing cost of around \u00a3300 a year to remeasure her leg and create a new compression garment if there is a change in size. The liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again. Without the operation, Mrs Wood must continue her daily struggle. She said: 'I get up in the morning and have a massage and put on compression garment - all that takes an hour. 'Then it's very difficult to walk. It weighs nearly three stone more than it should because it's filled with lymph fluid. Lymphoedema is a condition where the lymphatic system \u2014 a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood \u2014 isn\u2019t working properly.

{"article": "(CNN)Have Rick and his fellow survivors finally found a place they can settle in for the long term? That was the question left still unanswered at the end of Sunday night's season finale of \"The Walking Dead,\" and a finale record 15.8 million viewers tuned in to find out the answer. Rick was back in \"Ricktatorship\" mode, telling the residents of Alexandria that he knew what it took to survive and they should follow him. That led up to one of many moments where we gasped during the 90-minute finale. Here are five of the biggest gaspworthy moments:. 1. Morgan is back. We've literally been looking for him all season, and Rick's old friend Morgan -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance, wielding a stick he used to kick walker, and human, butt when necessary. And it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing W's on their heads, who, we would later learn, wanted to turn Morgan into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled. 2. Daryl looks done for. It was Daryl who happened upon that horde, and he and Aaron were soon surrounded and forced into a car, with little chance of escape -- that is, until Morgan rescued them. We rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that Daryl might die, but that was a close one. 3. Carol and her casserole. Melissa McBride continues to steal scenes left and right lately, and her threatening of Pete while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series' history so far. 4. Glenn gets shot. We seriously thought Glenn was a goner after a vengeful Nicholas shot him, then left him for a large group of walkers to attack. Somehow, Glenn survived and attacked Nicholas, but stopped short of killing him. That's our Glenn, always doing the right thing when it comes down to it. 5. Rick's memorable walker encounter. Just when you thought you'd seen everything, Rick literally squeezed a walker's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of Alexandria, in a bid to lead them toward survival. Rick was then rudely interrupted by Pete, who slashed Reg's throat in a fit of anger. At that point, Deanna told Rick to off Pete, which he did. Phew! It was one of the most intense episodes of the already hyperintense series, and our group of survivors somehow made it through.

Xiang Xiang was dubbed 'Mask Boy' after he suffered severe burns falling into a fire four years ago. The nine-year-old hates wearing the mask and it is hopes a series of further operations will rid him of the headgear. His family have taken him to Beijing, where he is set to undergo a series of further operations to repair the damage to his  face and body at a cost of around 300,000 yuan (\u00a332,000). Since being horrifically burned Xiang Xiang has only looked in the mirror once and seen the full extent of his disfigurement, according to his father. 'At the time he stared at the mirror for a long time and said one sentence, ''How did my face get so burnt?'' and then he never looked into the mirror again,' Mr Wang told the People's Daily. 'We are afraid he will be bullied and hurt. So this time coming to Beijing we must have our son healed so that he can be handsome again.' After the initial skin transplant, the boy was forced to endure a lengthy wait for further surgery to allow his breathing to fully recover from the ordeal. The nine-year-old wants to be 'handsome' and his family fear that he will be bullied because of his appearance. Xiang Xiang was playing with two friends when he fell into the fire leaving him horrifically injured. The lengthy delay has led to Xiang Xiang becoming self conscious about his appearance and aware of how his facial expressions and vision are restricted. 'At the end of last year his breathing ability had recovered and was at the standard required for the operation to go ahead,' said Mr Wang. 'My son said to me that he had to do the operation so that he could get rid of the mask.' The boy was forced to endure the cruel stares of passers-by after he bravely decided to remove his mask as he travelled to the hospital for his latest round of treatment. He told his father his father he needed further operations to 'get rid of the mask' The boy was forced to endure the cruel stares of passers-by after he bravely decided to remove his mask as he travelled to the hospital. 'People were staring at Xiang Xiang's injury which made the child very sad,' said Mr Wang. 'In the past my son hated the mask and often when he was getting ready to sleep he would hide the mask hoping that the next day he would not need to wear it any more.' Xiang Xiang was just five-years-old when he fell into the flames as he played with two friends in Fenyang. He also lost one finger on his left hand. After undergoing an initial skin transplant he was forced to wear the white coloured mask that was specially designed to assist the healing process. Heartbreaking images of little Xiang Xiang  were beamed around the globe and led to a fund being set up to help pay for the boy's treatment. The latest operations will look to address the opening and closing of his mouth, the limited use of his hand and hair loss. His father said when Xiang Xiang was getting ready to sleep he would sometimes hide the mask in the hope that the next  day he would not need to wear it any more. Xiang Xiang is said to hate the mask that protects his skin and is eager to finally see the back of it. Dr Shen, who is in charge of the boy's treatment, explained that he needed to undergo further surgery to ensure that he did not develop in an unnatural manner. 'As he grows up, and with skin growing back, it is possible that we need further rectifying operations,' he said. 'Therefore Xiang Xiang's plastic surgery will not be completed in one go. 'There will be at least seven to ten operations to complete the basic recovery.

{"article": "Rory McIlroy fired three successive bogeys late in his third round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational here at Bay Hill on Saturday to ruin a charge through the field. World No 1 McIlroy had closed to within one of the lead when he dropped shots at the 14th, 15th and 16th to finish the day seven adrift of tournament pace-setter Henrik Stenson. McIlroy said afterwards he still hoped to push himself into contention with a fast start on Sunday but admitted victory in his final tune-up before the US Masters was now unlikely. Rory McIlroy plays out of a bunker on the 11th hole during the third round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational. The world No 1, pictured playing his approach to the green on the sixth, carded a one-under-par 71. McIlroy is seven shots behind leader Henrik Stenson after bogeying three holes in a row on the back nine. 'Everything was going really well for 13 holes,' McIlroy said, 'and I got myself right into the tournament. Then I had a messy three holes. It would have been nice to have been a little bit closer to the lead.' McIlroy was not too dismayed by his late hiccup. He has worn the air this week of a man intent on saving his best for the Masters, which starts at Augusta in less than three weeks. So McIlroy chatted a little about Ireland's win in the Six Nations and opened his eyes wide when he heard how close England had come to getting the final try they needed. He will try to close the gap to Stenson and then spend the next fortnight honing his game in private. Henrik Stenson sits on top of the leaderboard after a second consecutive round of 66 on Saturday. Stenson, pictured after hit his drive on the eighth hole, has a two-shot advantage heading into the final round. Everything is about the build-up to Augusta where McIlroy will attempt to join a select group of the greats of the game by winning the only Major that has eluded him. Victory would lift him into the company of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods who all won the Masters, the US Open, The Open and the USPGA at least once in their careers. 'I have pretty much got what I wanted out of the week so far,' McIlroy said. 'It has highlighted a couple of things I need to work on and that's what I will do in the next couple of weeks.' McIlroy, pictured lining up a putt on the 10th green, will prepare for the Masters in the coming weeks. The 25-year-old is looking to complete a career Grand Slam with victory at Augusta next month. One of the reasons McIlroy played Bay Hill was because he wanted to replicate his routine from 2011 when he had a fortnight off before the Masters and led the field before collapsing on the back nine. 'It worked pretty well at Augusta, at least for 63 holes,' he said. McIlroy dined with Palmer, 85, on Thursday night, soaking up his wisdom and listening to tales of the way golf used to be. At the start of next month, he will be seeking to make some history of his own.", "abstract": "Rory McIlroy's charge through the field at the Arnold Palmer Invitational was ruined by three successive bogeys late in his third round, leaving him seven adrift of tournament pace-setter Henrik Stenson.

{"article": "A woman who tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic has had her case dismissed because a judge found she was'severely intoxicated' when she fell. Jane Hutch was having a celebratory drink at her rented townhouse in Doubleview, Perth, with her adult son and daughter on Christmas Day in 2009 after signing a lease on the property the previous day. Ms Hutch went upstairs at the two-storey property to find her bag, and when she could not see it in her bedroom she had a 'quick look' over the balustrade of a landing at the top of the stairs\u00a0to see if it was in the kitchen below. She lost her balance and fell over the balustrade, falling several metres onto the floor below. Ms Hutch suffered head and spinal injuries and is now a paraplegic. Jane Hutch tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic. She sued her landlord Christopher Geoffrey Ryan for damages in the District Court of Western Australia, claiming that the balustrade was too low and she was therefore unable to stop herself once she had begun to fall. But Judge Felicity Davis ruled that the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's'severe intoxication' and Mr Ryan was therefore not liable for damages. Ms Hutch gave evidence that she and her son started drinking sparkling wine at 10.30am on December 25, and said she 'probably' drank a bottle or the equivalent of 6.5 standard drinks. The accident occurred just before 1.30pm and she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Tests at hospital found she had a blood alcohol level about six times the legal driving limit. Toxicologist Professor David Joyce gave evidence that Ms Hutch's blood alcohol level suggested she had drunk between 20 and 21 standard drinks. Judge Felicity Davis ruled that the accident was caused by Ms Hutch's'severe intoxication' and her landlord was therefore not liable for damages. 'Based on her plasma and blood alcohol level and Professor Joyce's evidence, I find that the plaintiff was severely intoxicated and that this influenced her behaviour when it came to matters of safety,' Judge Davis said. 'I find on the balance of probabilities that the reason the plaintiff leaned beyond the point of no return was because of her state of intoxication.' Judge Davis also found that the balustrade measured 865mm and was compliant with building codes, despite Ms Hutch's expert witnesses submitting evidence suggesting it only measured 857mm. The judge said the landlord's expert witness, builder and building surveyor Darren Mouchmore, 'properly measured' the balustrade and found it to be 865mm.", "abstract": "A woman who fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic has had her case dismissed because a judge found she was 'severely intoxicated' when she fell.

{"article": "Blackpool chairman has been charged by the FA. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is facing a ban from football activities after being charged by the Football Association for text messages in which he called a supporter 'a retard'. The unpopular chief has until next Monday to respond to the charge and is set to be locked out of his own club if ultimately found guilty. Oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the Seasiders\u2019 worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour FA education course. The shocking text messages, seen by Sportsmail, emerged just before Christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan Stephen Smith, who he told to 'enjoy the rest of your special needs day out'. Oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange, however the FA announced on Monday that the messages allegedly constituted five breaches of its rules and now has until 6pm on March 30 to respond to the charge. In a another rant from Oyston, who has had abuse hurled at him as well this season, read: 'Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. 'You are banned because I think you are a p****. 'Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.' Oyston has also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: 'I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission'. Blackpool's fans protest against Oyston during the game against Charlton. A statement on the FA's website read: 'Blackpool FC Chairman Karl Oyston has been charged by the FA in relation to comments made in a text message exchange. 'It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules, and that during the text message exchange, Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC. 'It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3(1) is an 'Aggravated Breach' as defined in Rule E3(2), as each included a reference to disability. 'Mr Oyston has until 6pm on March 30, 2015 to respond to the charge.' The content of the messages first emerged just before Christmas and Oyston came under fire from fans of his own club as well as anti-discrimination group Kick It Out, while the local paper the Blackpool Gazette scrapped his weekly column with immediate effect. Blackpool fans have made their dislike for Oyston clear this season with songs and banners. The Seasiders chairman issued an apology via the club's official website in which he explained he was responding to threats and abuse to his own family. 'I would like to unreservedly apologise for any offence or distress caused by my text responses reported in the media recently,' he said. 'I regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family. 'My mobile number was placed on a social media website recently and it led to a barrage of abuse about my mother, father, wife, children and myself. 'In hindsight the aim of this was clear, and I foolishly opted to challenge some of the abuse, harassment and threats. 'Given my position, I should have acted with more responsibility and reported the abusive text messages, phone calls and answer phone messages to the police, rather than get embroiled in such an exchange.' Blackpool fans have held a number of protests about Oyston. However, Smith said at the time that he had not accepted Oyston's apology. Smith also claimed Oyston's position at the helm of Blackpool had become 'untenable'. 'The apology is weak,' he said. 'He has said that he is responding to messages that threatened and abused his family. I did not threaten or abuse any member of his family. His position as chairman is untenable. He has no choice but to resign.' Oyston has endured a frosty relationship with Blackpool supporters who have been disillusioned by events on and off the field during a tumultuous year at Bloomfield Road. Last Saturday hundreds of fans protested against the Tangerines' ownership and opted to go and watch non-league AFC Blackpool instead, boycotting the fixture between Lee Clark's men and Leeds. Blackpool are 17 points away from safety in the Sky Bet Championship and their relegation could be confirmed in their next game against Bolton.", "abstract": "Blackpool chairman, Karl Oyston, has been charged by the Football Association (FA) for sending text messages in which he called a supporter 'a retard'.

One irate passenger was so angry at the lack of cleanliness of his Virgin Australia plane during a flight from Sydney to Melbourne that he took a video of it and uploaded it to YouTube. The man known only as Stuart Mc called the video: \u2018Virgin Australia \u2013 A Disgrace.\u2019 What looks like a bolt is lying down the side of a seat along side some chewing gum. 'And they want us to believe Tiger is the discount carrier.... this is the seat I was allocated this afternoon on VA 868 SYD to MEL. Obviously short cutting cleaning is the way to making a profit for Virgin Australia,' Stuart Mc commented on the YouTube segment. However it was definitely a warts and all video with dirty seats the first thing that you see. Dust and grime also can bee seen lying down the side of the seat. As the camera pans along you then see what looks like chewing gum, dust, grime and bits of paper down the side of the seat. It's clear that the seats and down the side of them had not been cleaned for quite a while. Even the arm rests were dirty. It was a gross rather than great experience. Not that it was the only airline to be a loser in the cleanliness stakes. After splashing out up to \u00a39,000 on first class flights on British Airways from Gatwick to the Caribbean, on what was supposed to be a 'trip of a lifetime', TV news presenter Owen Thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat. Dust, detritus and hairs can be clearly seen in an other shot. The arm rest of the seat has obviously not been washed for a while. Videoing the evidence, the former BBC anchorman posted the evidence on Twitter, dubbing the service 'Filth Class'. Narrating the short 30-second video, the presenter explains: 'So this is BA first class and it is abs filthy. You see the marks on here, most of these you can just actually scrape off. 'You see the stains down here. It's when you open your seat that the real horror begins. There is also dust and dirt down the side of the arm rest. 'This is first class.

{"article": "Kevin Pietersen has signed a contract to return to Surrey this summer and will donate all of his salary to his KP24 foundation. The move gives the record-breaking batsman the opportunity to press for an England recall, after being sacked in February 2014 following the Ashes whitewash defeat in Australia. Pietersen cleared the way for a return to The Oval by agreeing a release from the majority of his Indian Premier League contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad - which clashed with the start of the English domestic season - and he will be available for Surrey's first County Championship match against Glamorgan in Cardiff on April 19. Encouraged by new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves' indication that he may be back in the mix if he can impress again in county cricket, the 34-year-old Pietersen has two months to do that if he is to achieve his dream of a Test recall in time for this summer's Ashes rematch. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches at the most to impress England's selectors. He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes. Pietersen told Surrey's website kiaoval.com: 'I'm absolutely thrilled to be back at Surrey. 'It's a club very close to my heart - and (director of cricket) Alec Stewart, (coach) Graham Ford and everyone at the club has been exceptionally supportive. 'There is a fantastic group of lads here, and I hope we can deliver what the great Surrey fans want to see - lots of runs and comprehensive victories.' Pietersen also wrote in his column in the\u00a0Telegraph: 'When I heard Colin Graves say that I would be considered for selection again if I play county cricket and score runs I realised I had the opportunity for a fresh start. I always said this was not about money and I will be donating my full Surrey wage to my foundation. 'Even if this does not work out and I do not get back in the England team, I will at least end my career knowing I gave it another shot. I would kick myself for a long time if I walked away now without having a go. 'A lot of people thought I would not be prepared to put in the hard yards and play county cricket but I will do anything to get that England cap back on my head.' Pietersen will donate his full salary from Surrey to his KP24 foundation. Imminent Surrey signing Pietersen says he will 'do everything in my power to earn a recall' with England. Stewart added: 'A Kevin Pietersen with ambitions to play for England and a real determination to score big runs for Surrey will be a huge asset to us.' The apparent clinching development in Pietersen's negotiations to rejoin the club which de-registered him at the end of last season was the Sunrisers' willingness to release him from the majority of his contract. Pietersen would have been in India for more than seven weeks - and Surrey, for whom he played only Twenty20 cricket last summer, did not appear immediately keen to secure his services again unless they knew his availability would be more comprehensive this time. The controversial South Africa-born batsman's ambition to play for England again may not depend entirely on him demonstrating form and fitness. But irrespective of mixed messages from the ECB, that is where he must start. He was described by ECB managing director Paul Downton as 'disengaged' during England's heavy defeat in Sydney almost 15 months ago - his last Test to date, in which the Ashes whitewash was completed. Pietersen was axed by England following their 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter. Pietersen in action for Surrey in the Natwest T20 Blast last summer. Pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash. Weeks later, Pietersen was sacked - in a meeting attended by Downton and also Test captain Alastair Cook. Downton, Cook, national selector James Whitaker and returning coach Peter Moores - contrary to the tone of Graves' remarks - have all reiterated, in their different forms of words, that Pietersen remains firmly on the outside as far as they are concerned. England embark on a three-Test tour to West Indies, without Pietersen of course, early next month - and have already been left in no doubt by Graves, set to begin his tenure officially in May, that victory over what he describes as'mediocre' opponents is non-negotiable. While they are busy with their Caribbean mission, Pietersen has his chance to impress and make headlines on home soil - and therefore put his name back in the mix in time for the start of the Ashes in July.", "abstract": "Kevin Pietersen has signed a contract to return to Surrey this summer and will donate all of his salary to his KP24 foundation.

{"article": "Do you love rice but are worried about your weight? The good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked. Cooking the rice with coconut oil, and then cooling it for 12 hours in the fridge, more than halved the number of calories in the rice when it was eaten. However, doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning, and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it. They also advise leaving the rice in the fridge no more than a day before reheating. Scroll down for video. Scientists have discovered that adding coconut oil to rice and cooling it in the fridge for 12 hours cuts the calorie content in half. The Sri Lankan researchers experimented with 38 kinds of rice from the country. Their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it, which is indigestible to the human body. Therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat, and has no calories. The scientists found a two-step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times. First, they added a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water, adding half a cup (105g) of rice, and then either simmering it for 40 minutes, or boiling it for 20 to 25 minutes. Then, they put the rice in the fridge for 12 hours to cool. Lead researcher Sudhair  James, of The College of Chemical Sciences, Sri Lanka, said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method, 'it might reduce the calories by about 50-60 per cent.' He said the team wanted to find food-based solutions to the problem of obesity in developing countries, where rice is often a staple food. 'We discovered that increasing rice resistant starch (RS) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem,' he said. The coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking, changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested, experts explained. A cup, or 210g of rice, contains around 240 calories. Mr James explained that starch can be digestible or indigestible. Rice is made of both of these types of starch. Unlike digestible types of starch, RS is not broken down in the small intestine, where carbohydrates are normally metabolized into glucose and other simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into RS, then that could lower the number of calories of the rice. This is because the coconut oil enters the starch granules during cooking, changing its architecture so that it becomes resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, Mr James explained. This means that fewer calories ultimately get absorbed into the body. The cooling for 12 hours is essential, but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the RS levels, he said. He added that the next step will be to complete studies with humans to learn which varieties of rice might be best suited to the calorie-reduction process. The team also will also experiment to see if other oils besides coconut have this effect. The research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific society. Doctors warn reheated rice can cause food poisoning. Doctors warn that reheated rice can cause food poisoning. However, it's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated. Uncooked rice can contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria. These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins that cause vomiting or diarrhoea. The longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat. How to serve rice safely:. \u00b7 ideally, serve rice as soon as it has been cooked. \u00b7 if that isn't possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within one hour) \u00b7 keep rice in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating. \u00b7 when you reheat any rice, always check that the dish is steaming hot all the way through. \u00b7 do not reheat rice more than once.

{"article": "Video footage has emerged showing a naked Air Force veteran running around his Atlanta apartment complex before police arrived on the scene and shot him dead. In the footage obtained by WSBTV, Anthony 'Tony' Hill, 27, can be seen walking outside the Heights at Chamblee apartment complex, climbing balconies and crawling around on the floor. Police responded to reports that an unclothed man was running around the complex and banging on people's doors. Officers arrived at the apartments just after 1pm on Monday. One witness told WSBTV that he told Hill to go inside otherwise he was going to get arrested. Scroll down for video. Erratic: A video shows 27-year-old Air Force veteran Anthony Hill walking around an apartment complex naked on Monday afternoon; he was later shot and killed by responding police officers. Concerns: Neighbors called police to report the naked man on balconies and knocking on doors. 'He was acting crazy but he was calm like he didn't know where he was,' said the witness, who did not wish to be identified. 'He was like kind of lost in his face.' An officer approached him and Hill turned towards him, authorities said. 'When the male saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer,' said DeKalb County Director of Public Safety Cedric Alexander. 'The officer called on him to step back, drew his weapon and fired two shots.' Witness Oscar Perez told ABC11Alive: 'The man, he was liked drugged, but he was naked and he was crawling. I think the police officer thought he was going to attack, so he shot him.' Hill was shot in the upper torso. The officer, who is white, is a seven-year veteran of the Dekalb County Police Department. He has not been identified. County police chief Cedric Alexander told reporters that the officer had been equipped with a Taser at the time of the shooting. He would not comment on whether the officer should have used the Taser but said that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation would take over the probe into the shooting. Veteran: Police said it was reasonable to assume that Hill, who was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East, was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the incident. Killed: Hill, pictured with his girlfriend Bridget, was shot after he ran at the officer, police have said. Heartbroken: Bridget took to Twitter on Monday to share her anguish over the death of her boyfriend. Shocked: Bridget said the couple had been celebrating three years together on Monday. He added that he could'reasonably assume' that Hill was possible suffering from mental illness at the time, given his behavior. On his social media profiles, Hill had used the hashtag '#IAmBipolar'. In his final Facebook post on Monday morning, Hill wrote: 'Where i once saw death i only see life.' Social media also shows Hill was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East. His girlfriend, Bridget Anderson, wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'My boyfriend was SHOT AND KILLED today by an officer. HE WAS UNARMED. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. 'I thought cops were suppose to protect and serve???? THEY TOOK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AWAY!!!!!' She added on Twitter that Monday had been their three-year anniversary. Scene: Hill was shot twice by a white officer at the Heights of Chamblee apartment complex in Atlanta. Dekalb County police chief Dr Cedric Alexander, pictured last year, said the officer was also carrying a Taser. 'Who will I share my secrets with now?' she wrote. 'Who will I call when something good happens? How will I move on from this? Lord give me the strength.' Police forces across the country have come under fire for their use of lethal force, especially against ethnic minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. Mr Alexander added: 'We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how do we expand our mental health training. It appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who may be in distress.' Hill is at least the third African-American since last Friday who has or has appeared to have been unarmed when killed by police. Police near Denver last Friday fatally shot an unarmed man who was a wanted fugitive. On the same day, an officer in Madison, Wisconsin fatally shot a biracial 19-year-old, prompting some 2,000 students to march in the state's capital on Monday.

Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United are all monitoring the stylish 24-year-old who signed from Wigan in a \u00a313million deal. They each want a proven midfielder and McCarthy is on their lists as they assess summer targets. James McCarthy (right) has attracted interest from Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal this season. The midfielder, pictured in action against Arsenal on Sunday, joined Everton in the summer of 2013 for \u00a313m. McCarthy signed a five-year contract on summer deadline day in 2013 but is not one of Everton's big earners and the nature of the last-minute negotiations meant assurances were given that his deal would be revised as his Goodison career progressed. However, though other Everton players have since opened discussions over new terms, McCarthy has yet to be approached. Tim Howard, Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley and John Stones all agreed new deals last year with manager Roberto Martinez, who himself signed a new deal last June, seeking to maintain a long-term core to his squad. Ross Barkley is one of a number of young players to have signed a new long-term deal with Everton. McCarthy has not been approached about a new contract despite his good form for the Toffees. McCarthy, a Republic of Ireland international, has matured into one of the most consistent Premier League players and shown his ability on the international and European stage. In Everton's 4-1 Europa League rout of Wolfsburg earlier this season he had a pass completion rate of 98 per cent. He is highly regarded at Everton and his influence on the team was sorely missed when he was out with a hamstring injury; in the 13 games Everton played without him, they won just one. Arsenal and Tottenham have both watched him since his return to the fold but were put off January bids knowing Everton would refuse all offers. Arsenal and Tottenham are still interested in Southampton's defensive midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) Manchester United are considering McCarthy as an alternative to Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman (right) Everton's faltering season though has given them a sense a deal could be brokered in the summer. Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin remains on their list of options too. United have concerns that Roma's Kevin Strootman may not recover quickly from his latest knee surgery and are assessing other options across Europe.

{"article": "The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. Now, as the comet approaches the sun and solar rays recharge Philae's batteries, Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin tells MailOnline he is confident of finding the probe soon - but it will be a race against time to get it working again. He warned that once the comet begins heading away from the sun in August it will enter hibernation again - but this time for good. Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline he is confident of making contact with Philae on comet 67P soon (approach of lander on 12 November shown). The probe has been silent since it ran out of power in November, and Esa scientists in Germany recently failed to make contact. Last week, experts at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) abandoned an eight-day attempt to find the probe - the first attempt at trying to restart communications since it went dark. Philae only had a limited battery supply when it landed, lasting just 60 hours before it ran out of energy. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. It managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta is continuing to orbit and study the comet. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. But it is covered in solar panels and, as the comet approaches the sun, it is expected to get enough power - 19 watts - from its panels to make contact with the orbiting Rosetta spacecraft. There will be several windows of opportunity as Rosetta makes its way around the comet for the two unmanned spacecraft to talk to each other. The next of these will be on 13 April. Making contact will enable scientists to get Philae to continue the groundbreaking science it managed to perform in its brief operational time on the surface - and it will also allow Rosetta to pinpoint its location. Speaking about the attempt to find the probe last week, Mr Martin told MailOnline: \u2018We were trying to see if the lander would wake up and, at the same time, we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation. \u2018We don\u2019t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander.\u2019 The main issue at the moment is that, for the lander simply to wake up, it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45\u00b0C (-49\u00b0F). But to start communicating with Rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power. It may have already reached the former level, which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we won\u2019t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter. This image sent back from Philae revealed its precarious position on the comet. It appears the probe is partially wedged against a cliff, with some of its solar panels shrouded in darkness. But this did not stop it from completing more than 90 per cent of its science goals in 60 hours of operation on the surface. Philae, pictured left by Rosetta on its approach to comet 67P on 12 November, needs 19 watts of power in order to communicate with Earth through Rosetta. Mission manager Mr Martin, pictured right, said they had already sent commands to the lander, some of which it may have carried out. The landing of Philae on 67P was a groundbreaking moment not only for Esa, but for spaceflight as a whole. It marked the first time a probe had successfully landed on a comet. Shown are some of the team celebrating when news of the successful landing was received back at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany. \u2018It\u2019s a very complex configuration,\u2019 explained Mr Martin. \u2018The lander", "abstract": "The Philae probe, which landed on comet 67P in November 2014, has been out of power since landing in an unknown location after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface.

Child trafficking has been a long-standing problem in China, but despite the efforts of the authorities, the sinister practice is thriving, leading to thousands of families being torn apart. The US State Department believes that 20,000 children are snatched every year \u2013 that\u2019s 400 a week. Scroll down for video. As many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in China every year and sold openly online, it\u2019s been reported. However, Chinese state media says the figure could be as high as 200,000, according to the BBC. Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they\u2019ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as \u00a310,500. In a bid to evade the spotlight of the police, child traffickers in recent years have turned to the internet to do their selling. Last year hundreds of babies were rescued by police in China after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants. The nationwide bust saw 1,094 people arrested as officers acted on information relating to four major internet-based baby trafficking rings. China's Public Security Ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption. Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they\u2019ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as \u00a310,500. Some critics say the trade is fuelled by the country\u2019s one-child policy. The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold - typically fetching half the amount boys do - aborted or abandoned. Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers. An investigation by the BBC revealed the plight of one father, Xiao Chaohua, who has not seen his son since February 2007 after he disappeared from their home in Huizhou, aged five. Since then Mr Chaohua has scoured the nation and even taken out TV adverts in an effort to find him, but to no avail. He claims that the problem of trafficking can only be eradicated if tougher laws are brought in to punish those to buy kidnapped children. Presently, they face a three-year jail term if caught, but it\u2019s claimed that many never find themselves in trouble over their actions.", "abstract": "Child trafficking is a major problem in China, with as many as 200,000 boys and girls kidnapped and sold online every year.

{"article": "Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen admitted recruiting three female officers into a prostitution ring. An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has been dishonorably discharged and sentenced to two years in prison for organizing a prostitution ring at an army base. Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country. As his court-martial was about to open earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts that included charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution. One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100. Two soldiers testified last year that McQueen recruited them and other cash-strapped female soldiers to join the prostitution ring. A military judge sentenced him to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge while leading a sexual abuse prevention program at the sprawling Central Texas post. However, he pleaded not guilty to sexual assault. One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. But prosecutors told Judge Lieutenant Colonel Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex. The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account. She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients. Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014.

Operation Jade Helm begins in July and will last for eight weeks. Soldiers will operate in and around towns in\u00a0Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Colorado where some of them wil drop from planes while carrying weapons loaded with blanks in what military officials have dubbed Realistic Military Training. But with residents of the entire states of Texas and Utah dubbed 'hostile' for the purposes of the exercises, Jade Helm has some concerned the drills are too realistic. Scroll down for video.

Headlines like Freedom Outpost's 'Operation Jade Helm\u2014military trains for martial law in American South-west' abound across the Right-leaning blogosphere and Info Wars warns that Jade Helm is simply 'an effort to test the effectiveness of infiltration techniques' on the American public. 'They're having Delta Force, Navy SEALS with the Army trained to basically take over,' Info Wars' Alex Jones said Sunday. 'Texas is listed as a hostile sector, and of course, we are...We're here defending the republic.' The Houston Chronicle reports that, among the planned exercises, soldiers will attempt to operate undetected among civilian populations. Residents, in turn, will be asked to report suspicious activity in order to gauge the effectiveness of the soldiers. Military officials say they've gotten the go ahead for the operations from local authorities such as mayors and county commissions. And sheriff's deputies told the Houston Chronicle they would ensure residents living near where aircraft were slated to create disturbances and drop soldiers, civilian and military vehicles will barrel through and where blank rounds would be fired. Jim Stewart with the Brazos County, Texas Sheriff's Office told the Chronicle that such exercises are far from anything new. 'Special ops for years have trained off-post for years, where they go out and have folks that are role players out on the economy,' said the Army intelligence veteran. 'They'll have a scenario they'll be following and they'll interact with these role players as if they're in another country.' However, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command themselves say Jade Helm is different. See more at KEYE-TV. Reassuring?

To stay ahead of the environmental challenges faced overseas, Jade Helm will take place across seven states,' the USASOC wrote in a March 24 release. 'The diverse terrain in these states replicates areas Special Operations Soldiers regularly find themselves operating in overseas.' The military has also reacted to widespread fear of the operation by calling some ultra-conservative coverage of the'martial law' drills alarmist and inaccurate.

Balearic Islands emergency services are continuing to search for him. Georgia Aquarium CEO Mike Leven said, 'We are very concerned. 'We hope he turns up soon and that everything is all right. Our thoughts are with him and his family.' According to Leven, Barbero received death threats after the videos surfaced. The embattled trainer did respond to the videos on Facebook. In a translated post he said: 'I believe a response is needed to this brutal and cowardly campaign against my profession.

But, according to a celebrity denim expert, there is a tried-and-tested formula to finding the perfect pair to flatter - and it's all about your body shape. Jean queen, Donna Ida Thornton, whose designs are worn by the likes of Millie Mackintosh, has devised some denim-buying hacks. If you have a boyish shape - similar to Cara Delevingne, left, and Cameron Diaz, right, \u00a0you can wear most styles, according to denim expert Donna Ida Thornton but add shape with some zip detailing like Cara. If you have a boyish shape - similar to Cara Delevingne and Cameron Diaz - you can wear most styles, according to Donna. 'Add some shape and interest with zips and details on back pockets,' she suggests for women with this figure. Pear-shaped women, who, like Kim Kardashian, have a smaller top half than bottom and boast fuller hips and a shapely lower half, should opt for high-waisted jeans. 'Look for skinny jeans in a high waisted style - it elongates the leg and slims down the hip,' said Donna. If, like Lena Dunham, you possess an apple shape you should opt for elasticated waistbands. Women with apple body shapes, which are larger across their mid-section, typically with slimmer legs, should look for plenty of stretch in a straight leg in a dark wash as they complement every curve, advises Donna. Ladies with long legs, like supermodels Candice Swanepoel, left, and Karlie Kloss, right,\u00a0look best in a mid to low rise to keep the waist at the right height, says Donna. Ladies with long legs, like supermodel Karlie Kloss, often struggle to find jeans that fit their stomach and their pins. Sharing her advice, Donna said: 'Ladies with long legs look best in a mid to low rise to keep the waist at the right height, whereas petite girls look great in a high rise that accentuates the waist and elongates the legs.' Revealing other essential tips for buying jeans, she explained that if jeans go on easily, go down a size. 'Kicking your way into the legs isn\u2019t unusual, and the waistband should be snug, if you can fit two fingers down the back that\u2019s good, a whole hand is not,' she said.

{"article": "A major player in online travel has finally 'fallen into line' by removing excess credit card charges two years after the Royal Bank of Australia ruled that surcharges should be limited to \u2018reasonable costs\u2019. Online booking agent Wotif confirmed\u00a0they are dumping their $5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $20 million dollars back into the pockets of Australian consumers. They are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $9.95 per person. Wotif have dumped excess booking fees which could save Australians $20 million a year. While Wotif has been praised for the move, consumers who expected to see a drop in prices  may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent, reported\u00a0Newscorp. Tom Godfrey thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online. Tom Godfrey from CHOICE told Daily Mail Australia that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further 'fleece' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees. Wotif said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company Expedia. Mr Godfrey said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to \u2018flout\u2019 the ban on excessive charges. \u2018It\u2019s great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we aren't happy.\u2019 He said excessive credit card charges are costing Australian\u2019s over a billion dollars a year, with some of the \u2018worst offenders\u2019 being Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and Tiger. \u2018People are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town,' he said. Klaus Bartosch, the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that's been signed by over 100,000 people, welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to 'consumer sentiment' by removing 'outrageous fees'. 'No where else in the world does this exist,' he said. Mr Bartosch started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging 'ridiculous' amounts for using credit cards. Mr Bartosch said prices are'misleading' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards. 'They are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers,' he told Daily Mail Australia. CHOICE recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for Visa and Mastercard and 2 per cent for prestige cards like America Express and Diners Club. According to the latest research data made available by MasterCard, Australian consumers are being surcharged about $1.6 billion each year. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges. Mr Bartosch believes these numbers prove that Australian's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies 'can not be trusted to self regulate'. CHOICE have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges. According to Mr Godfrey excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance. 'For too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban,' Mr Godfrey said.", "abstract": "Online booking agent Wotif has removed its $5.50 hotel booking fee and credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights, which could save Australian consumers $20m a year.

A teacher who groomed a teenage girl and made her enter a'slave contract' before travelling 400 miles to have sex with her once she turned 16 has been struck off. Kelvin Loraine, 31, met the then 15-year-old girl on an online chatroom in March 2013, after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on Skype at his behest. Shortly after the girl, referred to as Child A, turned 16, Loraine travelled more than 400 miles from his home in Durham to have sex with her in a hotel room in Plymouth, the National College for Teaching and Leadership was told. The disgraced teacher, who taught maths at a Sunderland school, admitted to also having let her watch him perform a sex act on himself via the video chat. He admitted receiving up to 40 photographs of her naked body - although he claimed this happened after her 16th birthday. A professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership said Loraine admitted unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute after a private meeting in Coventry. He had already received a caution from Durham Constabulary last July for possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of the child - with whom he first came into contact in the spring of 2013. In a written ruling the panel said: 'Child A would have been 15 years old at that time. They had daily contact online and by phone. Mr Loraine admits his communications, online and by phone, with Child A were romantic and sometimes sexual in nature. 'He admits he became aware she was 15 years of age at some point after the relationship commenced and at least 6 weeks before Child A's 16th birthday. 'Mr Loraine accepts Child A sent approximately 30 - 40 photographs of her naked body to him, sometimes but not always at his request. 'Mr Loraine asserts that this did not occur until after Child A's 16th birthday and during these communications Mr Loraine requested that Pupil A touch herself intimately using her finger, her hairbrush and a sex toy and that he viewed her performing these acts via Skype. 'Mr Loraine admits that this was for his sexual gratification. Mr Loraine also admits that, shortly after Child A's 16th birthday, he and Child A entered into a'slave contract' - the written terms of which are attached to the Agreed Statement of Facts.

On 30 November 2013, shortly after Child A's 16th birthday, Mr Loraine arranged to meet her at a hotel in Plymouth and travelled there from his home in Durham. They then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.' He agreed to the police caution on the basis she was 16 when the picture in his possession was taken and he was unaware an individual had to be 18 for such pictures to be legal. The panel said the inappropriate relationship started when she was 15 and continued after she turned 16. Although he was not her teacher he did tell her he was a teacher. The panel said this had the potential for establishing her trust in him and influencing her behaviour. They said: 'The panel is satisfied it is necessary for a prohibition order to be imposed in order to protect pupils and other members of the public, maintain public confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct.' They also recommended the case was so serious there should be no provision for him to apply to have it set aside in the future. Paul Heathcote, decision-maker for the National College for Teaching and Leadership panel, said: 'The panel is satisfied Mr Loraine's behaviour is incompatible with being a teacher.

A 2-0 victory over struggling Burnley - which the Belgium goalkeeper stressed was just as important as Sunday's win over high-flying Manchester City - saw the Reds record their sixth clean sheet in eight Premier League matches. They have now not lost in 12 league games, picking up 30 points, and have won seven of the last eight. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet (left) believes the team's improved defence helped confidence to grow. Mignolet kept another clean sheet against Burnley on Wednesday and has been pleased with his form. Jordan Henderson (third left) struck Liverpool's first goal from the edge of the area in the first half at Anfield. Liverpool were not seriously tested by the second-bottom visitors at Anfield on Wednesday night but Mignolet said that should not detract from the defensive work being done by the side. 'I think we defended really well. We were very organised and we didn't give too many things away,' he said. 'A clean sheet is nice and I am happy with how things are going but we all have to keep improving and keep looking forward. 'We're doing our jobs at the moment and we have to keep that going until the end of the season because it makes it easier for us to win games. 'Even at half-time, when it was 1-0, we were saying that we had to keep going because one goal can change the whole game. 'We wanted to make sure we didn't give any silly goals away. We kept calm and defended well and then we got that second goal, which makes things a little bit easier for us at the end. 'Teams likes Man City and Chelsea lost points against Burnley at home so we needed to get three points, otherwise that win over Man City would have meant nothing. 'So six points out of six was what we wanted, and we can move forward and we need to keep going like this until the end of the season.' Stand-in captain Jordan Henderson opened the scoring for the second successive game and the 24-year-old is growing into the senior midfielder role in the absence of Steven Gerrard, who returned to training this week after a hamstring injury. Gerrard leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer and Henderson, as current vice-captain, is favourite to assume the armband on a permanent basis. Henderson (left) has been filling in as captain in the absence of Steve Gerrard through injury. Gerrard (centre) is back in training but will leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season. Daniel Sturridge (right) headed in Liverpool's second goal in the game against Burnley on Wednesday. 'Jordan is a massive player for us,' said Mignolet.

{"article": "If Uxizandre\u2019s Ryanair Chase success on Thursday is to be AP McCoy\u2019s last Festival win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory. But, typically, at least for the time being, it will be confined to the recesses of the McCoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy-tale end to his Cheltenham career on Friday afternoon. Over breakfast, he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction, you don\u2019t win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his Betfred Gold Cup mount, Carlingford Lough, begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm. One thing is certain, the mood will be better at the McCoy table than it was 24 hours earlier. AP McCoy rides Uxizandre to victory in Thursday\u2019s Ryanair Chase for his 31st Cheltenham Festival win. McCoy celebrates with the trophy after his first Festival win of 2015 with his Peadar McCoy by his side. Wife Chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been \u2018melancholy\u2019 after two fruitless days amid, no doubt, a creeping fear that things were not going her husband\u2019s way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages. McCoy's wife Chanelle admitted a \u2018melancholy\u2019 had come over AP after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16-1 shot. All that changed when 16-1 shot Uxizandre, not even the first string of his trainer Alan King in the Ryanair Chase but transformed by the fitting of a visor, galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of Ma Filleule. Even the crowd seemed stunned at first. The roar took time to grow but by the time McCoy had returned to the winners\u2019 enclosure, they were raising three cheers. After being joined on the winner\u2019s podium by Chanelle, his father Peadar and boss JP McManus, McCoy said: \u2018Cheltenham is a very special place. It is where every jockey wants to win and I am no different. These are the days I am going to miss that\u2019s for sure. \u2018I had lots of rides coming into the week but did not have any real bankers. \u2018You have to keep going race after race and hope one of them wins. That is how my life has normally been, so there is no point changing this week. \u2018I was all right. You can try your best to make them go faster but you need the horse \u2014 and this horse is very well. \u2018I was a bit worried he would not have the stamina to see it out but he got a lot of the others in trouble trying to keep up with him.\u2019 McManus, his ally for a decade, looked as if he derived just as much satisfaction at being able to supply one last winner for his retained jockey as he does landing one of his legendary punts. He said: \u2018It is great to have a man like AP on your side. I am just so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival and that we provided it for him makes it even better. JP McManus, AP's ally for a decade, was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win. JP said: 'I am so happy he has had a winner at his last Festival... that we provided it for him makes it better' \u2018I remember years ago Christy Roche rang me and said \u2018\u2018Have you seen this young lad ride? He should be handicapped, not the horses\u2019\u2019. \u2018I respect AP and love everything he does on and off the racecourse.\u2019 McCoy will wear the green and gold McManus colours on John Kiely-trained Carlingford Lough, as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the Festival \u2014 Hargam, Princely Conn and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase which carries his own name. McManus has not ruled out the dream Gold Cup ending. He said: \u2018Carlingford Lough has a chance in a very open race. I was hoping he might be good enough. \u2018He had a few problems earlier in the season but nothing serious. He improved from the run in the Lexus Chase at Christmas and has a good 10-1 chance of winning in an open Gold Cup.\u2019 There are definitely plenty of dangers \u2014 about 17 of them \u2014 as few can be ruled out.

{"article": "She was just 15 years old when she and her brother were offered their own TV show, but Marie Osmond reveals the pressures placed on her were immense. 'I had producers take me out into the parking lot when I was 103 pounds and tell me that I was obese, disgusting and a disgrace to my family. That I needed to keep food out of my fat face,' the 55-year-old Dancing With The Stars vet told Closer Weekly. She was told The Donny & Marie Show would be canceled if she didn't lose weight and so she starved herself down to 97 pounds. Scroll down for video. In the spotlight: Marie Osmond revealed to the new issue of Closer Weekly that she was told she was 'disgusting' for weighing 103 pounds when she was  just 15-years-old on The Donny & Marie Show. Too fat?: Marie, pictured on stage with Donny in 1975, was hauled over the coals by TV producers who said she was obese and disgusting  and The Donny & Marie Show would be axed unless she lost weight. Surviving stardom: Now 55 and a grandmother, Marie has come through battles with weight and with depression and credits her faith and her family for helping her deal with the pressures of fame; her she is pictured in April 2014. Lasting stars: Donny and Marie talked to Closer Weekly for the 40th anniversary of their show. The producers knew just what buttons to push for the teen raised in the strict Mormon faith. The thought not only of being fat but of being responsible for everyone involved in the show weighed heavily. 'This sent me on a head trip - that 250 people could lose their jobs because of me,' she told Closer. The pressure to be thin continued long after The Donny & Marie Show ended in 1979 after four years, and plunged the star into a life-long battle with her weight. 'I was very young': The only girl in the Osmond family, Marie, pictured in 1974, \u00a0topped the charts in 1973 with Paper Roses but described her first recording session two years earlier as 'a terrifying experience' In the spotlight: Donny was 17 and Marie was 15 when their weekly variety show began airing in 1976 and the only Osmond girl starved herself to lose weight, dropping down to 97 pounds. There were other demands, too, placed on Marie and her brother Donny, who was 17 when the show started in 1976. The youngsters often worked  20-hour days and each week they had to learn new songs and dance routines and memorize scripts. They also hosted celebrity guests and that brought other problems with it for the pretty Osmond sister. 'I was very young and I remember Groucho Marx pinching my butt,' Marie said. 'He was a dirty old man.' Marie and Donny, who have been selling out shows at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas since 2008, sat down with Closer to mark the 40th anniversary of being offered their ABC show. At 15, the Paper Roses singer was already a showbiz veteran. She was 12 when she was taken to her first recording session, something she says was 'the most terrifying experience.' 'It was a full orchestra and rhythm section. I was the only Osmond girl, what if I failed?' she said. 'So I threw up! Then I went in and sang.' A brother-and-sister act: The Osmonds were famous around the globe for their dazzling white smiles, and also for the Mormon faith that helped protect them from the temptations that came their way after finding fame. Mutual support: The pair have helped each other through the ups and downs of life after The Donny & Marie Show ended and Donny told Closer his sister has 'been through some horrific times' Marie, the only girl in a family with eight boys, found fame in the wake of her brothers' worldwide success. Her older brothers Alan, Wayne, Merril and Jay had been performing since they were children and appeared regularly on TV's The Andy Williams Show throughout the 1960s. They were later joined by Donny and youngest brother Jimmy and enjoyed a successful pop career in the early 1970s, including performing backup for Donny's solo hits Go Away Little Girl and Puppy Love. After being convinced to join the Osmonds bandwagon, Marie recorded the song Paper Roses when she was 14 and it soared to the top of the country music charts and made number five on the Billboard charts. Still performing: 40 years on, the Donny and Marie show is going strong and they continue to entertain their legions of fans with their Las Vegas revue at the Flamingo Hotel that's been selling out since 2008. Today she is sanguine about finding fame at such a young age. 'I didn't have a childhood because I had a different kind of life,' she said. 'I didn't have a normal dating life or friends, but I don't know that anyone's life is perfect.'

{"article": "Few people expect Manchester City to go to Barcelona and overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg and reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. But here's 10 good reasons Manuel Pellegrini's men should travel in hope... 1 - CHELSEA PROVED MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN. Chelsea were 2-1 down on aggregate to Barcelona and down to only 10 men in their second leg at the Nou Camp in 2012 \u2013 and still went through. Goals from Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta put Barca in control even before John Terry was sent off. Then, incredibly, Ramires scored on the stroke of half-time and after surviving immense pressure, Fernando Torres scored to book Chelsea's place in the final, which they went on to win. Chelsea sealed a place in the 2012 Champions League final by drawing 2-2 with Barcelona at the Nou Camp. 2 - PELLEGRINI CAN TAP INTO MALAGA. Barcelona lost their last game at the Nou Camp on February 21 to Malaga, the team that Manuel Pellegrini managed between 2010 and 2013. Pellegrini will be able to get all the inside info on how they did it and also used to work with the winning goalscorer, Juanmi. If Juanmi can slay Barcelona, there's not reason why Sergio Aguero can't follow suit. 3 - NO REASON TO FEAR. City captain Vincent Kompany knows what it feels like to score at the Nou Camp, Joe Hart saved a penalty from Lionel Messi three weeks ago and Yaya Toure won the Champions League with Barca alongside the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique. While the rest of the world regard Barca's players as demi-gods, City have been up against them before and shown they are human, or played with them. Joe Hart saved a late Lionel Messi penalty to keep his side in with a chance of progressing to the next round. 4 - EL CLASICO AWAITS. Coach Luis Enrique won't be thanking La Liga for the way they've worked out their fixture list because an even bigger match lies in store on Sunday when Barca meet Real Madrid in a potential title decider. The temptation not to play at 100 per cent against City will be there particularly as they already hold a 2-1 advantage from the first leg. It will be up to Pellegrini's side to take advantage if the Barca players have half an eye on the weekend. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique will have one eye on his side's upcoming match against Real Madrid. 5 - CITY BEST IN ADVERSITY. If there is one thing Manchester City have proved in recent times it's that they should never be written off. They were eight points behind Manchester United with six games to play in 2012 \u2013 and won the title. In 2014, they were three points behind Liverpool with three to play, and again came out on top. Most significantly, they have shown 'bouncebackability' in Europe too. They qualified from the group stages despite taking two points from their opening four matches and trailing 2-1 against Bayern Munich in their fifth match. Manchester City showed on the final day of the 2011-12 season that they are capable of springing a surprise. 6 - PROLIFIC AGUERO. Aguero has scored six goals in six Champions League ties this season, at a ratio of a goal every 76 minutes. If he scores again in the Nou Camp, City will be halfway there to overturning the first-leg deficit. Pellegrini believes Aguero has the ability to be considered the third-best player in the world behind Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. A match-winning performance to rank alongside his hat-trick against Bayern earlier in the tournament would go a long way to making that come true. City forward Aguero (he's at the bottom) has scored six goals in the Champions League this season. 7 - HISTORY ON THE SIDE OF ENGLISH CLUBS. It's not impossible for English clubs not to be represented in the last eight of the Champions League \u2013 but history shows it's very rare. Only once since 1996 have the quarter-finals taken place without a Premier League team. With Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal gone, all hopes rest on City now. They haven't always been the most popular team since Sheik Mansour's takeover but the club might thrive on the need to restore some national pride. Manchester City are England's last hope following Arsenal's exit from the Champions League on Tuesday. 8 - ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME. Manuel Pellegrini has been criticised for rigidly sticking to 4-4-2 in Europe and being outplayed in midfield, as he was against Barca in the first leg. But when Aguero was injured for the critical final group game away to Roma, he played Edin Dzeko as a lone striker and City comfortably won 2-0. If Pel", "abstract": "Manchester City faces an uphill battle to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona in the Champions League, but there are reasons for hope. Chelsea's 2012 comeback against Barcelona, Pellegrini's knowledge of Malaga's win over Barcelona, and City's ability to perform in adversity are all reasons to believe. Additionally, City's prolific striker Sergio Aguero and the fact that English clubs have historically done well in the Champions League are further reasons for optimism."}

Standing on the top step of the podium was the indestructible human-looking phenomenon of legend, and next to him stood Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lewis Hamilton, of course, was the second terminator, the crushing victor of the Australian Grand Prix that gave him the perfect start in his attempt to become the first British driver to successfully defend the Formula One world championship. He has hung about with stars of the screen, fashion and music through a winter of a paparazzo\u2019s dream, but here he was after 58 laps he had rendered as interesting as counting sheep, the supreme driver of the moment. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel who completed the podium. World champion Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance. Hamilton flew off the start-line and never looked back as he cruised to victory in the first race of the 2015 campaign. Nico Rosberg, who finished runner-up last year, kept Hamilton honest, but in truth he was no match for his Mercedes team-mate. 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067. 2.

Although his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg put in some fastest laps, Hamilton seemed to be holding back, doing all he needed with measure and control. But for his one and only pit stop, he led throughout after effectively winning the race with a dominant pole position on Saturday. Rosberg was second, with Sebastian Vettel third on his Ferrari debut. \u2018Lewis made no mistakes,\u2019 said Rosberg. \u2018I wasn\u2019t able to get close to him, let alone try to overtake.\u2019 If there was any downside to Hamilton\u2019s victory it was the possibility it raised of a one-sided season, or at least, if Rosberg can find form, an internal duel. For these Mercedes are so invulnerable they could take you to all four corners of the Earth and back without so much as a splutter. Vettel was 34 seconds behind Hamilton, who, on this track, put Stevenage on the map with a breathtaking first few corners of daring and precision in his debut Formula One race eight years ago. The TV cameras barely focused on the Mercedes because routine genius can be boring to behold. Pastor Maldonado crashed into the wall on the first lap of the race after he was clipped by the Sauber of Felipe Nasr. Vettel and  Kimi Raikkonen bang wheels on the run down to Turn 1. It causes a concertina effect which ends in Maldonado crashing out. Jenson Button finished last, but it was a sterling effort to get his McLaren to the finish line following the British team's miserable winter. Hamilton was clearly delighted with his win in Melbourne. He shared a joke with\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger who conducted the interviews. Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race. Not only that but damaging to the sport, according to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. He is one of the most intelligent and garlanded figures in the sport but he might be considered something of a hostile witness for Formula One given his vested interest in the revival of his struggling team. But he deserves a hearing. \u2018When we were winning \u2014 and we were never winning with an advantage that Mercedes have \u2014 double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible", "abstract": "Lewis Hamilton won the Australian Grand Prix, the first race of the 2015 Formula One season, with a dominant performance.

{"article": "Despite the recent news that Ryanair had been given approval to offer low-cost flights from Europe to America, it seems that such a project may not be in the works after all. A statement, issued from Dublin, Ireland, shot down recent speculation about budget flights to the US. 'In light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings Plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so,' it reads. Despite earlier reports that Ryanair was developing low-cost transatlantic flights, the company is now denying such plans. However, it is understood that the ideas of such a transatlantic project is still being explored, but with the intention that Ryanair would not operate the flights. Instead, any sort of budget Europe to America service, should it come into fruition, would be operated by a sister company under a separate brand. Earlier this week, it was reported that Ireland-based budget carrier was moving forward on plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing as little as $15 (\u00a310). The news came on the heels of a statement made by Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, last year. He told the Irish Hotels Federation conference that Ryanair would be offering $15 flights to Boston and New York, but also admitted that passengers would be expected to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. Chief executive Michael O'Leary, has said that $15 flights were in development but 'four or five years off' 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats,' he reportedly said. He's also said in the past that the company has had a business plan in development for low-fare, transatlantic flights for awhile, but would need to wait until new aircraft could be ordered. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.'

{"article": "It's probably not the sort of substance you'd expect bikies to use to smuggle steroids into the country but the body-building drugs market is now considered so lucrative, estimated at a billion dollars in some quarters, that outlaw motorcycle gangs are using 'gay lube oil' to try and hide the ill-gotten gear. Australians spend up to $10 billion on fitness each year and a large chunk of that money now goes on illegal substances - and criminal syndicates have muscled in on the illegal part of the fitness industry, using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection. Steroid oil in sex lube vials, powders inside green tea packets and ephedrine packed in facial creams, are just some of the methods being used to avoid being caught. With criminal syndicates having had their supply of amphetamines and cocaine severely affected by a record number of busts, they have increasingly focused on the body-building market and are being supplied by underworld gangs in south-east Asia and the Americas. The steroid market is now considered so lucrative, outlaw bikie gangs have muscled in on the illegal industry and they're using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection, including place the substances inside sex aid packaging like these, labelled 'gay lube oil' Australian Police say bikie gangs have now shifted focus heavily into the steroid market as authorities crack down on cocaine and amphetamine crime syndicates. Some estimate the illegal market in steroids across Australia could be worth up to a billion dollars with Australians spending almost $10 billion on fitness each year. Over the past decade, the number of performance and image enhancing drugs detected at the Australian border has increased 7-fold, with South Australia recording the biggest percentage increase. Motorcycle gangs are trying to avoid detection by putting steroid oil inside products labelled'sexual lubrication' 'They are getting amongst it more and more, it's a different market for them and we are regularly staging operations targeting them and steroids,' revealed Detective Superintendent Mick Niland, the head of Queensland's Taskforce Maxima. 'They try many different ways to avoid detection, that's for sure.' And that's because there is an increasing demand for the illegal performance enhancing substances, one which continues to grow every year. At one Gold Coast health clinic alone, there have been up to 150 steroid injections reported in one month. Queensland and New South Wales are considered the hot-beds in steroid production and trade with South Australia, reporting the biggest (percentage) increase in the number of seizures in a year, registering just 1 in 2012 and then 30 in 2013. 'Half of our seizures in the past few months have been about steroids,' Dept Supt Niland added. 'They are always trying different ways to avoid detection,' said Mick Niland of Tasforce Maxima as his group battles against the increasing trade in steroids by bikie gangs and the methods used to avoid detection. The Bandidos and Lone Wolf bikie gangs have been targeted in raids by authorities trying to break their hold on the new business of steroids distribution. Queensland police busted a Wavell Heights operation in January, arresting a husband and wife over this haul. Steroid seizures and arrests are climbing every year, they are now at record levels and show no sign of declining, with the trade controlled by the motorcycle gangs, who are increasingly using the back of stores and city garages, instead of gyms and their traditional club-houses, to sell the illicit products. It's not just the 20-something gym junkies they're selling to, recent surveys have revealed that up to 3 per cent of 12 to 17-year-old school students have admitted to using \u00a0steroids to bulk up. Taskforce Maxima commenced in October of 2013 and 'initially we did find just small quantities of steroids within the gangs'. 'Since then it has grown, both the local production and trafficking of steroids.' In the past six months alone, Customs has intercepted more than 3000 packages of steroids, from all parts of the globe. Outlaw motorcycle gangs have muscled in on the illegal part of the fitness industry, using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection of steroid shipments. Customs officials are finding steroids secreted in a variety of manners, including pills and powder inside herbal products and even green tea packaging. They are even importing ephedrine in women's facial creams. Tasforce Maxima, along with officials from the AFP and Customs, raided 10 properties across parts of Queensland, arresting 7 people and locating 200 vials of Human Growth Hormone.

'The guy is one of the top guys in the world, you know, of course he's good,' he told Sportsmail. 'I'm just a little better. I think that his striking is maybe a little more basic for me. 'I think I have a little bit more of an awkward, outside of the box approach to it and I think that that's something I can use. A lot of his wrestling is pretty basic and I've been wrestling my whole life, so that's another thing I can use.' Having been out of action for nearly a year after being struck down with a bone infection last August, Maia is reporting a clean bill of health ahead of the contest and the submission specialist is looking to impress his countrymen in Rio. 'I am very proud to be here in Brazil again,' he said. 'I'm very happy with the opportunity the UFC has given me, to fight a main event here in Rio de Janeiro, a city I love - especially returning from an injury. I am 100 per cent now, I feel much stronger than I felt in my past camps.' Maia poses duriong the UFC Fight Night weigh ins at\u00a0Maracanazinho earlier on Friday. And when it comes to LaFlare's 11-0 record, which includes four consecutive wins under the UFC banner, Maia knows that he will have to be on top form to put the first blemish on the American's clean record. 'I will need to want to win the fight a lot more than he wants to,' he added. 'Because I know he has a lot of will power, but I need to have more than him.' Despite other fighters citing their reluctance to face off against a Brazilian opponent on their home turf, LaFlare believes that the crowd will offer Maia no advantage once the Octagon door shuts. 'I don't think it makes any difference to me. Once the Octagon doors are shut, it's just me and him in the cage,' he said. 'Some people could think differently but, for me, it's just me and him \u2013 just another day in the office.' The Brazilian Fight Night's co-main event packs a huge punch as well, as spectacular striker Erik Silva faces off against polarizing UFC veteran Josh Koscheck.

{"article": "Prince William arrived in China tonight for one of the most high-profile \u2013 and diplomatically sensitive \u2013 tours of his fledgling royal career. Following four successful days in Japan, the future king flew on to Beijing where he was greeted at the Norman Foster-designed Capital International Airport by British Ambassador Barbara Woodward, Britain's first female ambassador to the country. Also present was the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, and Ambassador Sun of The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. Scroll down for video. The Duke of Cambridge arrives at Capital International Airport in Beijing, where he was greeted by Chinese delegates and the British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward (second from left) Walking through the VIP section after arriving on a schedule flight from Tokyo, the prince glanced at a display of cherry blossom, lanterns and a display dedicated to the new Chinese year, the Year of the Sheep. Stepping foot for the first time on Chinese soil, the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the Royal family to visit the country since the Queen nearly 30 years ago. In truth, many had believed that William\u2019s father, Prince Charles, would be the first to stake that claim. The Queen\u2019s heir has been assiduously courting the Chinese in recent years on behalf of his charities, setting up a number of initiatives in the country, including The Prince\u2019s Charities Foundation (China) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture. He has also met with several senior Communist party leaders in the UK. However he has also made no secret of his personal, and deeply held, opposition to Chinese actions in Tibet, regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (reviled in Beijing as a dangerous separatist), to Clarence House. The pair have even been photographed holding hands. Prince William with the\u00a0British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. After taking part in the formal handover of the former British Colony of Hong Kong in 1997 to China, Charles also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as \u2018appalling old waxworks\u2019. Two years later let it be known he was boycotting a Buckingham Palace banquet in honour of the then visiting president of China, Jiang Zemin. William\u2019s grandfather, Prince Philip, also has form in the country. During the Queen\u2019s 1986 visit to China he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of British students: \u2018If you stay here much longer, you\u2019ll all be slitty-eyed.\u2019 Something of a herd of elephants in the room, then, for 32-year-old William to manoeuvre \u2013 and that\u2019s even before he flies to the west of the country to visit China\u2019s own dwindling band of wild Asian elephants and convince the locals to curb their demand for ivory and other illegal animals products. First, however, he will spend a morning in Beijing, visiting the exquisite Forbidden City \u2013 the ancient home of China\u2019s deposed emperors - as well as a traditional Hutong, a traditional narrow alley unique to the country. He will also meet several senior Communist Party leaders, including, it is believed, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang. With China on course to overtake the United States as the world\u2019s largest economy, the UK government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and William\u2019s visit will be seen as part of that. Given the sensitivity of these meetings the prince \u2013 who is putting off becoming a full-time working royal for at least two years to work as an air ambulance pilot \u2013 will have to show both maturity and diplomatic dexterity. The royal is scheduled to visit the  Forbidden City \u2013 the ancient home of China\u2019s deposed emperors (Pictured: William with\u00a0Barbara Woodward) He will no doubt be grateful for the assured presence of the Queen\u2019s favourite diplomat, Sir David Manning, who has accompanied him to the Far East at her request. Later on Monday he will fly to Shanghai to embark on a concerted push to promote British business and culture when he opens the Government\u2019s GREAT festival of Creativity at the city\u2019s Long Museum. The festival is designed to showcase British innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health, technology, education and entertainment. He will even attend the premiere of home-grown success story Paddington, although William will be too busy to see the actual film. It\u2019s a packed programme and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince\u2019s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy, William has made the right noises so far, it seems. Earlier in the day the Prince was in northern Japan, where he was greeted by Chine-style lions. Thousands of well wishers lined the streets during his visit to the Chime of Hope Shopping Centre in Onagawa, northern Japan earlier today. In Japan he even threw his usual caution to the wind and was persuaded to don a Samurai outfit \u2013 although drew", "abstract": "Prince William has arrived in China for a high-profile tour, following four successful days in Japan.

{"article": "Need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Peter Scudamore and Marcus Townend reveal their favourites while a group of racing enthusiast\u00a0celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival on day two. PETER SCUDAMORE\u00a0- Eight-time champion jockey and rider of 13 Festival winners. BEAST OF BURDEN. (Neptune Investment Novices\u2019 Hurdle, 1.30) This Rebecca Curtis-trained contender has long been on my radar and looks a horse of massive potential. Beaten over a shorter distance at Newbury over Christmas \u2014 his hurdling debut \u2014 but has won his other three races this season with great authority. BEST ODDS: 12-1. Beast Of Burden winning the Excel Signs Novices' Hurdle Race at Bangor-on-Dee Races on February 6. DON POLI. (RSA Chase, 2.05) One of the Irish hotpots of the week and looks a future Gold Cup contender. Won the Martin Pipe Conditional Novices\u2019 Handicap Hurdle at last year\u2019s meeting and has won his two races as a novice chaser. The most recent of those was his authoritative three-length defeat of the highly-rated Apache Stronghold in the Grade One Topaz Novices\u2019 Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. BEST ODDS: 6-4. Don Poli, ridden by jockey Mikey Fogarty, winning the Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle last year. Racemail tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day. Robin Goodfellow (Sam Turner) and Captain Heath (Marcus Townend) napped 8-1 National Hunt Chase winner Cause Of Causes, while Townend also landed his next best bet (The Druids Nephew 8-1) to complete an 80-1 double. Turner also picked winners Douvan (2-1), Un De Sceaux (4-6) and Champion Hurdle winner Faugheen (4-5), while Peter Scudamore went for the first two Willie Mullins\u2019 winners. BARADARI. (Coral Cup, 2.40) Rated by jockey Aidan Coleman (above) as one of his best chances of the meeting. His boss Venetia Williams has to be respected here and this contender looks like he still could be a touch in front of the handicapper. BEST ODDS: 16-1. SIRE DE GRUGY. (Queen Mother Champion Chase, 3.20) Usually two quick runs might be a negative with the chance they have knocked the competitive edge of horse but Gary Moore\u2019s reigning champion thrives on racing and there are very positive reports emanating from his Sussex stable as he prepares to defend his crown. He looks to have put his injury problems behind him judging by his last time out Chepstow win. Punters looking for a longer-priced each-way option should consider Simply Ned. BEST ODDS: 3-1. Baradari (right) on the way to winning The Keltbray Holloway's Hurdle Race at Ascot on January 17, 2015. MARCUS TOWNEND - on the best each-way bets. BARADARI. (Coral Cup, 2.40) Staying on really strongly when fifth in last year\u2019s shorter Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle and was on the mark over two miles three furlongs at Ascot in December. That form has worked out well. This stiffer test looks likely to elicit even more improvement and he looks one of Venetia Williams\u2019 best chances of the week. She won this in 2005 with Idole First. BEST ODDS: 16-1. SOURIYAN. (Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle, 4.40) Lambourn trainer Jamie Snowden was successful on the opening day of last year\u2019s meeting with Present View and, although that injured gelding has unfortunately not made it back the time, this stablemate looks a lively outsider. Has won only one of his three hurdle races but his two defeats should not be held against him, especially last time out on bottomless ground at Ffos Las. Has improvement in him. BEST ODDS: 25-1. Modus ridden by Tom O'Brien winning the EBF Junior' Standard Open NH Flat Race at Cheltenham last year. MODUS. (Weatherbys Champion Bumper, 5.15) Eighth in this race last year and purposely saved for another crack at the prize by his Welsh trainer Robert Stephens. He reckons his contender is a much stronger more mature performer now so he can give the Irish, who dominate this race, a run for their money. BEST ODDS: 25-1.

Kris-Deann Sharpley (left) was found dead in the bathroom while he son Jackson (right) was found in his bed.

Police have said Mr Sharpley's death is not considered suspicious but DI Isherwood stopped short of confirming the tragedy was a double murder-suicide.

DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety. 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said. 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said. The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal.

Last public appearance: Vladimir Putin with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Russia last week. It was claimed the crisis over Ukraine and murder of an opposition politician may have caused a collapse in Mr Putin's health. But another theory, advanced by the lawyer of murdered Boris Nemtsov, was that the strongman may be lying low because he is 'afraid' of an assassination bid. Rumours: The Ukraine crisis may have contributed to a collapse in Putin's health, it has been claimed. Putin loves to be seen as an ever-present action man, but the Russian president has been absent from public view for a week. The 62 year old's unusual absence has dented his tough-guy image. His aides scrambled to explain he was healthy and his macho handshake remained so strong 'it breaks your hand'. Putin was last seen in public when he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 5 March. Official pictures have emerged of meetings since then, but rumours say these in fact took place earlier before his sudden and unexplained disappearance. Nemtsov's lawyer claimed Putin may be scared over the high profile murder yards from the Kremlin, suggesting the Russian leader maybe in hiding fearing an assassination bid. 'Perhaps Putin, even completely sincerely, was bewildered and even afraid,' said Vadim Prokhorov. 'Because if you can do that next to the Kremlin, then is it not possible to do it along the route of the presidential motorcade?' Spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the health speculation over Putin as'spring fever'. The leader was 'holding meetings all the time' to solve the 'crisis'. 'There is no need to worry. Everything is fine,' said Peskov, not explaining why Putin did not make an appearance to disarm the rumour-mongers.

{"article": "The Supreme Court has given a former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant. On a 6-3 vote, the justices on Wednesday revived Peggy Young's discrimination claim against UPS and sent the case back to a lower court. The case concerned employers' responsibilities under the 37-year-old Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Atlanta-based UPS maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light-work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women. Peggy Young (pictured in December last year), a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, speaks to reporters outside the Supreme Court in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court is giving the former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant. But the company changed its policy as of January and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers. The justices gave Young another chance to litigate whether UPS should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006. Writing on behalf of the majority, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court is required to determine if the employer had 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual justification' for treating employees differently. Breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of UPS policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities, injuries or otherwise might need accommodations, and asked, 'Why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?' Breyer said there is a 'genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young's'. The outcome reflects a'middle ground' that Justice Elena Kagan suggested during arguments in early December. Courts must now re-examine Young's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim. A federal district court judge and an appeals court had ruled in favor of UPS, which was backed by business groups in the case. The two sides in the case disagreed over whether UPS agreed to accommodate non-pregnant workers requesting light-duty assignments. UPS and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason. The case concerned whether the package delivery company violated a federal law, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, by denying Young's request. Young, who worked at a Maryland facility, had acted on a midwife's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg). Young, now 43, said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters, but UPS said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds. Young left the company in 2009. The Virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts. UPS has since changed its policy, and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers. Nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so. In recent months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young's situation. Yet the U.S. Postal Service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that UPS has now abandoned. Supporters of Peggy Young, a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, attend a rally outside the Supreme Court in DC in December. The justices found in Young's favor on Wednesday.", "abstract": "The US Supreme Court has given a former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant.

The case concerned employers' responsibilities under the 37-year-old Pregnancy Discrimination Act."}

The Radio 4 drama's village of Ambridge, based in the fictional West Midlands county of Borsetshire, was flooded in the latest sensational storyline. Accompanying the show were live minute-by-minute updates of the floods on the BBC website, including weather forecasts and 'breaking news' headlines - but listeners said the graphics were 'insulting'. The BBC faced a deluge of complaints from listeners over its bizarre online coverage of a fictional flood disaster in The Archers, which included maps and graphics on the corporation's website. A fake BBC weather forecast showed rain falling on the fictional village of Ambridge, near Birmingham. This week's episodes of The Archers have followed events taking place over one day of severe rainfall in Ambridge, with the drama building throughout the day as the River Am burst its banks. The BBC put out fake tweets and warnings from the Environment Agency, as farmland around the fictional village became inundated with water - mirroring the flooding of the Somerset Levels this time last year. The rolling coverage included maps and graphics to help listeners understand what was happening, but some listeners said visual aids 'insulted their intelligence'. Some listeners added that they could not understand what was going on because of the loud background noise of rainfall and heavy winds. Echoing the floods in Somerset last year, the BBC live coverage reported farmers rapidly trying to protect their land and even linked to a real-life account of floods in Worcester. Under a 'breaking news' headline, the online update said a character on the programme was given CPR. A realistic weather forecast also appeared on the minute-by-minute internet coverage, but listeners said it insulted their intelligence. The BBC put out fake tweets and warnings from the Environment Agency, as farmland around Ambridge became inundated with water. In other developments on the Radio 4 drama, 16-year-old character Phoebe Aldridge went missing but was later found, and Rob Titchener was injured as he saved three people from flooded stables. The rolling updates on the BBC website included a video  forecast by Midlands Today weather presenter Rebecca Wood, who warned people to be wary of floodwater and severe winds. Many listeners were unimpressed by the programme's online coverage, with some taking to forums to brand it 'insulting' and confusing. One fan wrote: 'It would 'help' me to feel I was regarded as an adult who knows this is all fantasy, that the residents of Ambridge do not exist, that they are not actually glugging about in the Am's excess water, rather than be told at the end of the episode that tweets and blogs about the flood from Ambridge residents can be read/heard. 'Cannot stand this cross over between fiction and reality, the fiction should be strong enough to stand in its own right and not need these add-on insults to intelligence.' The programme's storyline mirrored the reality of the flooding of the Somerset Levels (pictured) last year. Echoing the floods in Somerset last year, the BBC live coverage reported farmers rapidly trying to protect their land and even linked to a real-life account of floods in Worcester. Another wrote: 'A friend of mine, a loyal and forgiving listener, told me that when she saw on the Archers Home Page a 'weather forecast' for Ambridge that looks exactly like the real ones that appear on the BBC news pages, she felt really cross, felt that her intelligence was being insulted. 'She loves the fictional programme but knows its not real life and is angry that the programme makers think she is stupid enough to want this sort of nonsense.' Other complaints focused on the storyline being too confusing and background noise being too loud. 'You can't do this on the radio. Just shouting into the mic does not make it a dramatic and gripping storyline. No idea where anyone was half the time, whether they were driving, wading or climbing up the wall,' one listener wrote. A spokesman for The Archers said: 'The flood storyline has been building for some time. 'The Archers has a long tradition of reflecting the agricultural world and the current storyline, which fans will know has been building for over a year, mirrors what farmers across the country experienced in recent floods. 'When developing the script, the writers spoke to real-life farmers and it is their experiences that inspired this week\u2019s events in Ambridge. 'This is the first time we have done live blogging and it has been amazing to see audiences engage with us and experience this week\u2019s events as if they too were residents of Ambridge.'", "abstract": "The BBC received numerous complaints from listeners over its coverage of a fictional flood disaster in The Archers.

{"article": "Damien  Markey (pictured) and his wife Jenny were dismissed by the University of Bolton\u00a0after being accused of leaking embarrassing stories. A lecturer and his wife have been sacked from a struggling university after being accused of leaking embarrassing stories about its controversial \u00a3200,000-a-year vice-chancellor to the Press, it emerged yesterday. Damien and Jenny Markey were summarily dismissed by the University of Bolton after articles in the Daily Mail highlighted how the institution spends public money, a union said. The couple, who have three young children, deny being the source of stories revealing that the university was lending vice-chancellor Professor George Holmes \u00a3960,000 to buy a new house and spending up to \u00a3100,000 on staff away days to the Lake District. Critics had branded the expenditure a waste of money from an institution which has spent much of the 11 years since it became a university near the foot of national league tables. The latest case demonstrates how harshly public bodies treat those even suspected of being whistleblowers, let alone those who are proven to have leaked information to the media. It comes amid mounting alarm that staff in all organisations are not being protected from punishment if they report their concerns to the Press. The sackings were also branded a worrying blow against the tradition of free speech on campuses. Mr Markey, 42, was dismissed as a senior lecturer in visual effects for film and television after a 45-minute disciplinary hearing last Friday for \u2018leaking information to the Press aimed at damaging the university\u2019. According to his union he was told he had been overheard talking on his mobile phone using the words \u2018boats\u2019 and \u2018lakes\u2019, and accused of being the source of the story that the university was sending its 700 staff to a Lake District hotel in a series of away days for pep talks by Professor Holmes, who has a yacht moored nearby. The article first appeared in Times Higher Education, which yesterday said neither Mr Markey nor his wife were the source. Details of the trips had been sent to all staff, while the two-year loan to Professor Holmes appeared in university accounts. The struggling university paid up to \u00a3100,000 to send all 700 of its staff for stays at  four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa (pictured) in the Lake District. Mr Markey was also accused of making malicious statements about colleagues and bringing the university into disrepute for highlighting concerns about a shortage of equipment following an \u00a3800,000 flagship project, the union said. His 36-year-old wife, an academic administrator in the health and community studies department, was dismissed on Monday over similar allegations which she also denies. The couple have denied revealing that the university lent  vice-chancellor Professor George Holmes (pictured) \u00a3960,000 to buy a new house. Mr Markey, who is said to have had an unblemished disciplinary record, was secretary of the local branch of the University and College Union (UCU) and led a walkout in 2013 in protest at a planned 1 per cent pay rise. The couple had been advised not to comment yesterday as the union insisted it would be appealing against the dismissal. General secretary Sally Hunt said: \u2018These sackings are completely unjustified. Nobody likes looking a bit silly in public, but to start axing staff without evidence is the response of a desperate despot, not a university vice-chancellor.\u2019 Bizarrely, the university\u2019s official Twitter feed briefly \u2018favourited\u2019 a UCU tweet branding 53-year-old Professor Holmes a desperate despot. Mrs Markey is a member of Unison whose regional secretary Kevan Nelson said: \u2018We are alarmed that the university has taken this arbitrary and vindictive decision. We will challenge this by all available means.\u2019 Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said dismissing university staff accused of whistleblowing could have a chilling effect on freedom of speech. A university spokesman said: \u2018The university is comfortable that procedures have been followed and as yet no appeal has been lodged. The process is not connected with a staff member being a trade union official. The university does not comment on the merits of individual cases.\u2019 Whistleblowing in the public sector is supposed to be encouraged, but last week there was alarm that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood had agreed plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to the Press without permission or face being sacked.", "abstract": "A lecturer and his wife have been sacked from the University of Bolton after being accused of leaking embarrassing stories about its vice-chancellor to the press.

Mr Greener, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month, aged 71. 'Chris, as my wife would say was a 'gentle giant', he was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly. 'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around. 'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh. 'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to 'break his legs'. 'My wife and I are thankful to Chris for all of the great memories that he has provided us with and we will never forget the gentle giant that we loved dearly.'

Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people, at his parish church in Hayes, near Bromley, Kent. He was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones. Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not. He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man.

Fellow actor and friend Ross Sambridge, 7ft 1in tall, met Christopher at the Tall Club which he founded. Ross said 'He was a great guy, a real gent.' Matthew Uden Funeral Director from W.Uden and Sons said: 'I had the pleasure to find out about Christopher after I had a long chat with his friends, they described him as a gentle giant who had an enormous heart. 'The funeral went very well with some beautiful things being said about his life and antics, I am sure that he would have been pleased with his send off.

On the other hand, though, we can not demand that he should score all of his chances. 'It is clear to see that the training efforts have been good for Nicklas recently.

Sophia Trow, eight,\u00a0has taken on Clarks over its'sexist' shoes range saying she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies. The eight-year-old schoolgirl said she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies (pictured shoe from Clarks range) 'I really want dinosaur shoes because they leave footprints in the sand and mud,' she said. 'Clarks should learn what girls really want and do something about it.' She said she felt like killing anyone who told her she couldn't have or do things 'just because I'm a girl'. 'I don't like how girls just have to like pink and purple - I like blue and science and fossils,' she said.

{"article": "Most people have walked to the next street and even to the next town to enjoy some fast food from the takeaway rather than eat the less exciting options in the fridge at home. Now it seems chimpanzees will also go out of their way in order to find their favourite snacks. Researchers at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago have found that chimpanzees are willing to walk longer distances to get their favourite food - grapes - even when they are offered another option closer to hand. Chimpanzees at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago exchanged white PVC pipes (above) for either grapes or carrots. The findings suggest that our often irrational willingness to fulfill our cravings for fast food may have origins far back in our evolutionary past. Dr Lydia Hopper, a research scientist at the Lester Fisher Centre for the Study and Conservation of Apes at Lincoln Park Zoo, said she hoped to explore whether the convenience of the snack on offer may also impact how far chimpanzees are willing to travel. Chimpanzees have special 'words' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups. Primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in Holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in Edinburgh. Their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects. Many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture. the researchers, whose findings are published in the journal of Current Biology, watched a group of adult chimpanzees from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in Edinburgh Zoo. By analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples, they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010. While the Dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the Edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds. After a year of integration, the grunt calls for apple were still different, but after three years the calls produced by the Dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from Edinburgh. She said: 'The chimpanzees, to a limit, were willing to travel farther to obtain the more-preferred grapes. 'Future studies should test whether chimpanzees would be willing to exert more effort for more-preferred rewards if the type of effort was different - for example, time to process the food or increased competition to negotiate.' Dr Hopper and her colleagues, whose research is published in the journal Peerj, gave a group of six captive-born chimpanzees at Lincoln Park Zoo rewards in exchange for small lengths of PVC pipe that the apes had to collect from a single location. The chimps could exchange these 'tokens' at one of two locations - a close by one that gave them a carrot reward or one further away that gave them a grape. In a previous study Dr Hopper and her team had shown that the chimps preferred grapes to the carrots. Over the course of 15 months the researchers changed the locations of the food to see how the chimps would react. They found that over time the chimps would travel further to collect the grapes in preference over the carrots. Their behaviour could be seen as surprising in the context of wild chimpanzees where animals will often have to take food where they can find it. Dr Hopper said: 'It was quite fascinating to see the developments between each of the three phases of the token exchange study. 'In addition to learning about food preferences and proximity, we also observed innovative, problem-solving behavior among the chimpanzees.' The first chimpanzee to discover the grapes at the far location was a low-status female called Chuckie. Dr Hopper said that it is possible she began foraging in the further location because it was an opportunity to avoid competition from higher-status chimpanzees. The chimpanzees in the study preferred grapes to less exciting carrots, much like this chimp at Taronga Zoo. Chimpanzees, like the one above, are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom and their behaviour can help to shed light on our evolutionary past, such as how the human diet has changed over time. She added that the findings could also help zoos improve the way they care for chimps. She said: 'In captivity, primates are provisioned with food by human caretakers and so have reduced choice over the options available to them. 'Unlike wild primates that spend a large proportion of their waking hours foraging for food, captive primates are typically fed following a regular schedule. 'This study was not only of academic interest but also created novel foraging enrichment for this group of chimpanzees and encouraged them to explore their environment to find the best possible foods.'", "abstract": "Chimpanzees are willing to walk longer distances to get their favourite food, grapes, even when they are offered another option closer to hand, according to researchers at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.

{"article": "(CNN)Real Madrid fell to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at the hands of Athletic Bilbao Saturday, potentially handing the La Liga advantage to arch rival Barcelona. A stunning header from Aritz Aduriz shortly before half time was enough to win the day for an organized and impressive Bilbao. Real piled on the pressure for much of the second half but couldn't find a way past a staunch opponent despite finishing the match with four strikers on the park. Gareth Bale struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while Arduriz almost doubled Bilbao's lead with another headed chance late on. The result means second placed Barca can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table Rayo Vallecano Sunday. Of more immediate concern to Real boss Carlo Ancelotti after the game, however, was his side's lack of cutting edge. \"I think the problem we are having at the moment is quite clear,\" Ancelotti told reporters. \"We are not finding a way through like we did in the games before. We've only scored one goal, from a penalty, in two games. \"That is the problem we have to fix. We lack efficiency up front.\" Real are now without a win in two league games while the 4-0 February hammering at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid, the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947, is still fresh in the memory. With the second El Classico fixture of the season against Barcelona only a fortnight away, Ancelotti is looking for a quick fix to his side's attacking inhibitions. However, such worries are of little concern to a Bilbao side celebrating its first win over Real in five years. After a slow start to the season the Basques are now up to eighth position. \"We are very proud of how hard we worked,\" goalscorer Arduriz said in comments carried by the AFP news agency. \"The three points will prove a huge boost.\" \"The fans have enjoyed it a lot and they deserved that after the poor performances at San Mames earlier in the season.\" Bayern Munich continued its seemingly inexorable march to a third consecutive Bundesliga title with a come from behind 3-1 victory away to Hannover. Hiroshi Kiyotake gave the hosts a surprise lead after 25 minutes but Xabi Alonso levelled shortly after. A second half brace from Thomas Muller ensured the Bavarians would increase their league at the top of the Bundesliga to 11 points as second place Wolfsburg fell to a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Elsewhere Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's winning streak came to an end with as Jurgen Klopp's revitalized side were held to a 0-0 draw with Hamburg. Paris Saint Germain returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, for 24 hours at least, with a convincing 4-1 win over Lens at the Parc de Princes. David Luiz opened the scoring as the first half came to a close before Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the Parisian's advantage from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Substitutes Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore secured the win after Yoann Touzghar had pulled one back deficit for Lens. Lyon will return to the Ligue 1 summit should it dispose of Montpelier Sunday.

{"article": "Gary Neville surveyed Tottenham's right-side and described it as a 'graveyard' after it was torn apart in the first-half by Manchester United. The problem for England coach Neville and his boss Roy Hodgson, who was at Old Trafford, was that this graveyard shift was manned by four Englishmen: Kyle Walker, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Eric Dier. Like Harry Kane and Danny Rose, also in the Spurs team, they had been hoping to deliver the type of display which might catch Hodgson's eye for the right reasons after he had changed his plans and hit the north, rather than go to Chelsea. Andros Townsend fails to hide his frustration after being taken off at Old Trafford during a torrid first half. England manager Roy Hodgson takes his seat to watch Manchester United and Tottenham on Sunday. The England squad will be named on Thursday for games against Lithuania and Italy and although Kane is certain to be involved, despite failing to make an impact in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United when his first effort on goal came in the 89th minute. Spurs defended terribly and were killed off by three first-half goals before completing the game in something of a daze as United coasted home and it damages their hopes of finishing in the top four and reaching the Champions League. Mauricio Pochettino dubbed it the worst performance since he arrived at White Hart Lane last summer and promised to examine what went wrong before they return to action against Leicester on Saturday. Marouane Fellaini buries this chance for United's opener inside the first 10 minutes despite Eric Dier's tackle. Manager Mauricio Pochettino (left) attempted to change Tottenham's fortunes by replacing Townsend. The Tottenham defence were in disarray as Michael Carrick has the time to head in for Manchester United. 'I am not disappointed with the result but I am worried about the performance,' said Pochettino. 'You can lose here but the performance was very poor. We need to analyse and try to fix that. We're all disappointed. Not only me. But all the team. We need to understand why it happened. We need to fix it. That maybe the poorest we've played this season. 'We came, ready to compete but from the beginning it was difficult. We didn't play our normal way. The first half was poor and at 3-0 it is difficult to come back. 'We tried to play forward as is our philosophy, but it is difficult when you concede and make a lot of mistakes. Individually and collectively, we were very poor and that's why we lost the game. The key factor was us. We were the key factor in the game. Wayne Rooney celebrates compounding Tottenham's misery, scoring the third goal at Old Trafford. 'We didn't deliver a good performance. We made a lot of mistakes. We never found our way to play and allowed Manchester United to play.' Townsend was hauled off after half an hour and replaced by Mousa Dembele as Pochettino tried to get hold of possession as they were being over-run by United in midfield. 'It was not because Andros was poor,' he said. 'We tried to change to keep the ball.' Soon after the switch, a mistake by Nabil Bentaleb presented Wayne Rooney with the third goal and Tottenham's fate was sealed before the break. Mason also came off, early in the second half with a 'knock' while Emmanuel Adebayor returned for his first appearance since January as a late substitute. Adebayor was back in the squad because Roberto Soldado hurt his knee in training, on Saturday. Pochettino said Soldado's injury was 'not serious'. VIDEO Top four still possible - Pochettino.

He's said to be only the second dog ever known to have four prosthetic limbs. \"You can't explain to an animal why you are putting these contraptions on their feet. You can't explain to them, that it's to help them,\" foster mom Laura Aquilina told CNN affiliate KDVR. The Loveland, Colorado, dog's paws suffered extreme damage from frostbite. His feet were then reportedly amputated by his trainer. Brutus has been adopted by Aquilina who's been walking and exercising the dog to learn balance. \"He just has these little peg legs to get around on and he does a pretty good job inside the home,\" says Aquilina. But his challenge has been walking outside where his \"high-stepping...resembles a bucking bronco.\" He was fitted with the devices last year, first in the rear and then front feet came 6 to 8 weeks later.  His artificial limbs are made by Orthopets of Denver. \"Brutus is an amazing case of a beautiful dog who was dealt a short hand,\" said Martin Kauffman, founder of the company that makes prosthetics for about 250 animals worldwide a year.

{"article": "Many wearables record your movements but one firm has developed a range designed to help you track other people. These include bands that keep tabs on your children, your elderly relatives and your pets. Each device is controlled via an app where a parent, concerned relative or pet owner can monitor and track its wearer's every move. A Chinese firm called Haier has developed a range of wearables that help you track other people. Senior bands with a leather strap have GPS technology built in so relatives can keep an eye on elderly people. The range was unveiled by Chinese tech giant Haier at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Its child and senior bands have GPS technology built-in but while the former is bright and colourful, the latter has a more classic look with a leather strap. Both are waterproof and are fitted with proximity sensors that feed location to an app where users can monitor the wearable\u2019s movements on a map. Colourful wearables for children also track their location. They are fitted with\u00a0proximity sensors that feed a child's location to an app so that parents can see their location on a map. Phone maker Doro has launched a social networking tool for seniors called Connect and Care. It connects elderly people with relatives and carers and the service can be used to call for help and assistance in an emergency. Alternatively, the firm said it can also provide help with basic everyday household tasks such as closing a window. The service is optional and comes with Doro phones, and there is an Android and iOS app for relatives to keep an eye on the user and monitor their movement and communication. It gives alerts to the family if irregularities are detected \u2013 for example loss of movement. The app will also remind them to call their relative regularly. Concerned parents and relatives can also use the app to set up safe zones, meaning if a child or elderly relative leaves a dedicated zone, the app will send them an alert. The app also stores a log of the wearable\u2019s GPS history. Although many apps and bands track people in a similar way, Haier claims its devices differ because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker. Similar to how a baby monitor works, the user can listen to ambient noises around the device to determine their location if there is a problem, for example. Users of the app can also talk to the wearer through the band. And for pet owners, Haier has also developed a smart collar that works in a similar way but for cats and dogs. In the future Haier said it plans to launch an SOS service that can be accessed directly from the band in the case of emergency. The company didn\u2019t announce prices or availability for the devices. Haier has also developed a smart collar for dogs. The firm claims\u00a0 its devices differ from others on the market already because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker.

The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a canine's health, track its location and even allows owners to speak to their dog remotely. The device can also stream videos showing what pets are up to, using a state-of-the-art built-in camera. The gadget, created by Motorola and video streaming developer Hubble, uses 3G to send alerts to the owner's smartphone, while they are away from their pets.

{"article": "The remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in Siberia by oil workers. Two tusks, teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles (50km) from Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia. Oil workers had been digging at a site owned by Rosneft close to the town when they noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket. Ancient: Two mammoth tusks (shown above) together with fragments of jaw, teeth, tibia and ribs were dug from the frozen soil of Siberia.\u00a0Oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket. Using shovels they then unearthed a second tust, a tibia, ribs, teeth and fragments of the animal's jaw. Aton Rezvy, head of palaeontology at the Khanty-Mansiysk Museum of Nature and Man, said he believes the mammoth is at least 10,000 years old. Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths. All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence. However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths. Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction. He estimated that the giant animal had been a fully grown adult female, around 30 to 40 years old when she died. He said they hoped to conduct further analysis of the bones to learn more about the mammoth. He told the Siberian Times: 'We can send the find to determine the radiocarbon date. 'Genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - European or North American.' Recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in Siberia may have originated in North Ameria and migrated across the Bering Strait when sea levels were lower. Many believe the original Siberian population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago, with North American mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago. The exact reason for their extinction is still debated with many blaming changes to the climate as causing their demise. Others have pointed to evidence that humans and neanderthals hunted the giant creatures along with other ice age megafauna and may have pushed them to the brink of extinction. Palaeontologists who examined the mammoth's remains (shown above) estimate it died 10,000 years ago. Oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from Nyagan in Russia (above) when they found the mammoth. They estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female, around 30 to 40 years old. A recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western Europe around 30,000 years ago. Just a few isolated populations of mammoth are though to have clung on. Dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in Siberia, including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice. The mammoth's remains were unearthed about 30 miles from the town of Nyagan in Khanty-Mansi, Russia. Vladimir Bednyakov (pictured above) had been operating the digger when he unearthed the mammoth tusks. Vladimir Bednyakov was operating the excavator when he discovered the latest mammoth. He said: 'I noticed something in the excavator bucket. It turned to be a mammoth tusk. 'We have the rule - if we find something, we stop the work and call the bosses.

{"article": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have been trying to paint him as a gullible teen who was recruited by his extremist brother to bomb the Boston Marathon finish line two years ago. But today, prosecutors presented the jury with a never-before-seen photo that tells quite a different story. Seen in the bedroom of his family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits at a computer chair and points to a black flag behind him - not unlike the kind used by extremist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. Tsarnaev's former best friend Stephen Silva testified in court on Tuesday that he saw the flag hanging in Dzhokhar's room, the one time he visited the apartment to watch The Walking Dead. Scroll down for video. Decoration: A new picture emerged of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in court on Tuesday, showing the accused Boston bomber posing underneath a black banner of Islam in the bedroom of his Cambridge family home. Silva was also the friend who lent Tsarnaev the gun used to shoot an MIT police officer in a confrontation a few days after the bombings. While the so-called Black Banner or Black Standard has been co-opted by Islamist extremist groups in recent years, it has much deeper origins in the Muslim world. The prophet Muhammed used a black standard when he fought, which is why it continues to be used as a symbol for modern-day jihadists. According to Boston University master Arabic lecturer Giselle Khoury, the flag reads: 'There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger'.

However, quickly after the picture of the flag was shown in court today, U.S. District Court Judge George A. O\u2019Toole Jr ordered taken out of court since he found it 'illegible'. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said another witness, who did not take the stand today, would be explaining the flag's significance further. Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, and shooting dead a university police officer three days later. Where the Boston Bombing was hatched: The jury deciding the federal death penalty trial were also shown other pictures from the Tsarnaev family home, including the image of the right of Dzhokhar's home computer. Authorities release this picture of the flag - which has become a symbol of Islamic terror groups the world over since the 1990s.

He said his brother was very strict, very opinionated, and. that since I wasn't a Muslim he might give me a little s*** for. that,' Silva said. Defense lawyers opened the trial at U.S. District Court in. Boston with the blunt admission that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had. carried out the crimes he is charged with, focusing their hopes. on the jury sentencing him to life in prison rather than the. death penalty he could face if found guilty. They contend Tamerlan was the driving force behind the. attacks and that his younger sibling followed out of. subservience.

He. testified he had gotten the gun from a friend, intending to use. it to protect his drug business, and also used it in a robbery.

Due in court: Felicity Bassouls (left), 67, labelled Cohen (right) a 'disrespectful bully' when he split with her daughter Abby late last year. Rumour: Rihanoff (pictured) and Cohen both vehemently deny that any sort of romantic relationship took place. Mrs Bassouls is due in court this month accused of bombarding Cohen with calls and emails, The Sun reports. A Northampton Police spokesperson told the paper: 'A 67-year-old woman has been summonsed to appear before Northampton Magistrates court on Wednesday, March 18, to face allegations of harassment.' It was in September that Mrs Bassouls branded Cohen a 'bully' and called his behaviour 'disrespectful'. At the time, The Daily Express reported she said: 'I cannot believe what Ben Cohen has written - I am afraid to say, when you are a celebrity and in the limelight, you have to treat people with the same respect that you expect from the public.

Your behaviour has been so disrespectful and very intimidating not just to myself but my husband also.' News of the couple's split was linked to rumours between Cohen and his Strictly Come Dancing partner Kristina Rihanoff - fuelled by the pair's on-screen chemistry and steamy routines on the 2013 show. Both have vehemently denied that any sort of romantic relationship took place. Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008. The couple's public statement in September read: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children. 'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.' Partnership: Ben Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff perform the Rumba on Strictly Come Dancing in October 2013. Their split is the latest in a long list of post-Strictly break-ups. Susanna Reid split from the father of her three children following her appearance on the hit show, and Rachel Riley - made her split from her husband known in November - when they called time on their relationship, post-dancing appearance. Cohen's on-screen chemistry with Kristina Rihanoff, sometimes known as \u2018The Siberian siren', was widely noted in the 2013 show.

{"article": "A giant semi-fossilised egg that is almost 100 times larger than a chicken's egg and still has the tiny skeleton of a bird inside is to go on sale for more than \u00a350,000. The rare egg, which is 12 inches long and more than eight inches in diametre, belonged to the now extinct elephant bird that lived on Madagascar. The flightless birds, which stood nearly 10 feet (three metres) tall and weighted half a tonne, died out in the 17th century after heavy hunting. Scroll down for video. This 12 inch long elephant bird egg - just one of 25 known to remain intact around the world - is going on sale. There are thought to be just 25 preserved intact elephant bird eggs left in existence, with most in museums. Now one owned by a German marine biologist Professor Hubert Caspers, who worked at the Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science before his death in 1998, is to go on sale in Bruges, Belgium. Genetic material has been extracted from the shells of ancient elephant bird eggs. It has raised hopes that it may be possible to use cloning techniques to resurrect the extinct species. By injecting the genetic material into the unfertilised eggs of other large flightless birds like the ostrich, it may be possible to recreate the elephant bird. However, scientists face significant challenges that need to be overcome before this is possible. Cloning birds is considered to be particularly challenging. Extracting enough DNA from eggshells is also thought to be another limiting factor. Finally much of the habitat the the elephant birds once inhabited has now changed, so there may be few places where such a large species could now live. Scans taken of the egg, which is at least 400 years old, have also revealed the tiny bones of an embryo that had started to grow inside along with dehydrated organic material. Scientists were recently able to extract DNA from a similar egg, raising hopes that it may be possible to bring the elephant bird back to life using cloning techniques. Auctioneers Rob Michiels, who is selling the egg along with other items from Dr Caspers collection, said the egg appeared to be older than other eggs that have been sold recently. He said: 'The eggs of elephant birds are extremely rare - there are probably 25 of them in the world. 'This once comes from the collection of Dr Caspers and we have been asked to sell it by his children who thought it was a dinosaur egg. 'The children didn't know a lot about their father's collection. 'I was invited to Hamburg to look at a collection of antique tiles that he owned and I spotted the egg. It was just sat in a box. 'We have had a CT scan of the egg and it showed there is still organic, dehydrated material inside in the form of fetal bones. 'Technically, you could extract DNA from it and if you have a very large ostrich you could re-create a form of an elephant bird. 'The mother either ran away from the nest or was killed.' A CT scan of the elephant bird egg revealed dehydrated organic matter, shown as pink in the image above, and fragments of fetal bone still preserved inside the egg, shown by the small white mark in the pink material. The egg that has come up for sale (left) is one of the largest in the world and was laid by the now extinct elephant bird (right) which grew to around ten feet tall and lived in Madagascar until the 17th Century. The elephant bird, or Aepyornis maximus, was one of the largest birds to have ever lived. They are thought to have been common in Madagascar until they wre hunted into extinction during the 17th century. Fossilised egg fragments can still be found on the ground in some parts of Madagascar. David Attenborough, the natural history broadcaster, owns an almost complete eggshell that he pieced together from fragments collected by locals while he filmed Zoo Quest to Madagasar in 1961. The CT scans took slices through the egg and revealed dehydrated organic material and bone fragments inside. Another elephant bird egg was sold in 2013 for \u00a366,675 - more than twice its expected value. Douglas G. D. Russell, senior curator of birds, eggs and nests at the Natural History Museum in London, said the elephant bird eggs were now very rare. He said: 'The export of their eggs from Madagascar is now strictly forbidden by the country\u2019s legislation and complete eggs are relatively rare. 'As a rare, complete egg of an extinct species with some, albeit minimal, foetal bone it is noteworthy and all additional information on this enormous enigmatic bird is exciting.' Broadcaster David Attenborough is one of the few people to won a giant elephant bird egg after he pieced one together from fragments brought to him by locals while he was filming in Madagascar for the BBC in 1961.

Whether barking codes to each other over the loudspeaker or simply relaying news in difficult-to-understand abbreviations, it's not uncommon for passengers to wonder just what exactly is going on. Now British Airways Senior First Officer, Mark Vanhoenacker, has spoken to MailOnline Travel to reveal the most unusual jargon used on flights, and what it really means... British Airways Senior First Officer and author, Mark Vanhoenacker, shares the strangest in-flight jargon. The Heavy. 'This isn't a reference to my waistline!' Vanhoenacker tells MailOnline Travel. 'British Airways will always have tow pilots flying at any one time, but will have three and sometimes four pilots on its long-haul services, such as those flights to Singapore or Buenos Aires. 'The heavy pilot takes turns flying, allowing one of the other pilots to take a break.' The en-suite fleet. 'This is an affectionate term for the 747 fleet,' he explains.

Positioning refers to when crew members travel as passengers, often when a route is switching upon arrival. Positioning. 'This occurs when crew members travel as passengers,' Vanhoenacker reveals.

Every airline has their own call-sign, and for British Airways, all aircraft identify themselves as'speedbirds' Speedbird.

Sharper, right in an LA court on Monday, admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case. He was sentenced immediately. He also is expected to change his plea in person in Los Angeles on similar allegations. Similar hearings will follow in Las Vegas this week and in New Orleans in the next month. The Arizona and California cases, combined with others in Nevada and Louisiana, are likely to lead to a long prison sentence. In each state, Sharper was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women when they were unconscious or otherwise unable to resist or consent. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Warren Granville said Sharper will serve his time in federal custody and that the Louisiana case will be resolved through a federal court. In Arizona, Sharper admitted sexually assaulting one victim, though police say he drugged and sexually assaulted three women, at an apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe in November. Authorities say a search of the Tempe apartment turned up a shot glass with a white residue that turned out to be zolpidem, and California investigators discovered that Sharper had a prescription for the drug. Last year, Sharper's attorneys said their client did not make the drinks that authorities say he used to drug the women. One of the women told police she hadn't had any alcohol that night until Sharper insisted she drink a shot. Another young woman said she had been drugged, then went to bed, locked her door and wasn't attacked. The next day, one of the women confronted Sharper, who denied wrongdoing, according to the reports. The reports said Sharper was in Arizona to visit a woman who lived at the apartment.

{"article": "(CNN)As many as 13 senior leaders of al-Nusra Front, including the terror group's military commander, were killed in two Syrian airstrikes Thursday, a Middle Eastern security source who was briefed by Syrian intelligence told CNN. Abu Hammam al Shami was among those killed in the strikes against al-Nusra, al Qaeda's largest affiliate in Syria, the source said. Syria's state news agency SANA also reported al Shami's death. The special operation that took place in Hobait, in Idlib province, was part of a wider effort by Syrian forces to destroy areas believed to be gathering points for al-Nusra militants around the province, according to SANA. According to a 2014 al-Nusra video, al Shami joined the group after years of training in Afghanistan and Iraq. Also killed in the northwestern province of Idlib was a senior Saudi operative in the group, the source said. There were initial indications that al-Nusra leader Abu Mohammed al Jolani was wounded in one of the strikes, the source said Thursday. But on Friday, the source told CNN the latest assessment of Syrian intelligence was that al Jolani was not injured. The strikes took place in the towns of Salqin and Hobait, both near the city of Saraqeb in Idlib. One strike targeted a meeting of senior al-Nusra Front leaders; the other was on a home being used as a base, the source said. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition that is hitting ISIS targets in Syria said its planes weren't involved. \"Within the last 24 hours, we have not conducted any airstrikes within 200 miles of the province of Idlib,\" the spokesman said earlier Thursday. Al Shami was featured in a March 2014 video released by al-Nusra Front, in which he discussed his failed attempt to mediate between his militants and ISIS after rising tensions between the groups. The video included a biography by the group of al Shami, which was translated by the Long War Journal. It said that in the late 1990s, al Shami traveled to Afghanistan, where he was trained in a camp run by Abu Musab al Suri, a veteran Syrian jihadi strategist. Al Shami then trained in al Qaeda camps, where he met one of the 9/11 hijackers and personally swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden. By the time of the 9/11 attacks, al Shami had started to train recruits in Afghanistan and was named as the head of the Syrian jihadist contingent within al Qaeda. After the fall of the Taliban, he fled Afghanistan with senior Egyptian al Qaeda operative Sayf al Adel, the group said in the video. Al Shami began operating in Iraq, where he began working with al Qaeda in Iraq founder Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, conducting training for the group during the Iraqi insurgency, the al-Nusra video stated. In 2005, al Shami returned to Afghanistan for a short period, at the request of al Qaeda's leadership. When he got to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, one of bin Laden's top deputies, Attiyah Abd al Rahman, tasked al Shami with leading al Qaeda efforts in Syria, but he was arrested as he traveled through Lebanon, according to the video, and was detained for five years. After being released, he found his way to Syria, where he joined al-Nusra, the group said.

{"article": "A teenager was killed by stepping in front of a train just minutes after being told his grades weren't good enough to stay at sixth form college, an inquest has heard. Michael Platt, 18, had been studying in the first year of sixth form at Ifield Community College in Ifield, West Sussex, and had left the school just ten minutes before he was struck by a train and killed. An inquest at Horsham Coroners' Court heard he had been told he had not achieved the grades to enable him to return for a second year, and was advised to go to Central Sussex College's Crawley campus to see if he could join a course there. Student Michael Platt, 18, walked in front of a train at Horsham station, West Sussex, after finding out he did not have the grades to progress into the second year of college, an inquest has heard. Instead, in a state of 'turmoil', he jumped over the level crossing where he was struck by a train and killed. Michael from Gossops Green, East Sussex, was a member of the college choir and had planned to go to university to study child psychology. Mother Jane spoke at the inquest, and told the coroner her son 'was the life and soul of the party', Crawley News reports. She said her son was her best friend, and added: 'The only time he told me anything, looking back, in hindsight, was he thought the world wasn't a nice place and he had an issue with the way society is. 'All he said was \"what is the point? We struggle; we work hard for nothing at the end of it\". 'I said \"you leave a legacy\". But to him the world was an ugly place.' The 18-year-old had been studying in the first year of sixth form at Ifield Community College in Ifield, West Sussex, and had left the school just ten minutes before he was struck by a train and killed. Inspector Gary Ancell said. 'As the train driver approached the level crossing he said he saw people on either side of the closed gates. 'As he got nearer he saw a young male jump over the barrier and stand in the middle of the railway track, immediately in front of his train. 'There was nothing the train driver could do and he could not stop in time.' Coroner Dr David Skipp said as there was no note left behind, or a phone call from Mr Platt to loved ones, he did not believe the teenager had meant to take his own life. He recorded an open verdict, and added: 'I expect he was in turmoil when he left the school. 'Whatever was going through his mind, he took absolutely drastic measures, measures which I think he hadn't considered the effects of, and who would be hurt by what he did.'

Accused: Ibo Cha allegedly murdered and raped an 11-year-old girl but the police said he had not been arrested. The video footage was shot in September\u00a0but has only come to light following the kidnapping and murder of alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan in Dimapur. Ibo Cha was dragged into the centre Meluri village, stripped, strung up with rope and beaten for an hour before dying of his injuries. Men took turns attacking him and a 'ring-leader' appears to stop them form killing him too quickly. Inspector General of Nagaland, Wabang Jamir said Mr Cha had not been arrested and the villagers took the law into their own hands before the police became involved. He said: 'The police was not informed about the rape and murder of the young girl. Unfortunately there was no report lodged and we only learnt about the case after the beating of this man incident.

{"article": "(CNN)The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging an Alabama law that will force those under 18 seeking an abortion to go through an adversarial process that's akin to a trial. Generally, laws in the United States require parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion. But for some children, parental consent is impossible or even dangerous. This class of minors must seek a judicial bypass. While the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states, this Alabama law may have gone too far. Here are the suspect provisions of this \"bypass by trial\":. \u2022 Alabama has turned what is supposed to be an informal, child-centered hearing into more of a trial. \u2022 The court can appoint a Guardian ad Litem -- normally an appointed lawyer for a child in, say, a divorce proceeding or a hearing involving unfit parents -- for the fetus. \u2022 The minor may be cross-examined by the district attorney and possibly the minor's parents. \u2022 Information about the minor's pregnancy may be disclosed to her family, friends and employers, and they might even be brought to court to testify -- against the minor. When it comes to abortion, minors are supposed to enjoy the same constitutional right of privacy as adults, free from undue state interference. However, the Supreme Court has also specifically articulated reasons why the constitutional rights of children are not identical to the rights of adults. Children are vulnerable and unable to make critical decisions and, of course, parents have a right to participate in raising their child. States may pass laws that subject minors seeking an abortion to an additional requirement: parental involvement. However, if the state chooses to require parental consent for a pregnant minor to get an abortion, the state also must provide an alternative procedure for obtaining that authorization -- one that \"bypasses\" having to get Mom and Dad's permission. The Supreme Court has required that these hearings \"must assure that resolution... be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained.\" Plus, and perhaps most importantly, the procedure bypassing parental consent cannot be a thinly veiled mechanism for an \"absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto.\" In plain language, hearings must be quick and quiet, and they cannot be held in kangaroo court. The problem is, this does not give a lot of detailed direction to courts about how exactly to conduct these hearings. It's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly, and that sooner or later, a state like Alabama would experiment with state abortion law. Our system was specifically designed to allow states to experiment with social and economic legislation. Of course, that state prerogative is also tempered by a federal court's power to strike these laws down if they are unconstitutional. In this case, the ACLU's position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far. A hearing is fine, it seems, but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible \"undue burden\" on the right to have an abortion. This has been defined by the courts as placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the adult, or minor child seeking the abortion. The federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether Alabama's law violates established Supreme Court bypass requirements. But what about the actual bypass requirements themselves? They are a creation of the Supreme Court. Striking down an act of a state legislature is one thing -- challenging settled Supreme Court precedent is entirely another. What if the constitutional standards for bypass procedures contain something of an intrinsic paradox? Consider how it applies in this case. In Alabama, a judge at one of these hearings is required to waive the parental consent requirement if the judge finds either:. (1) that the minor is mature and well-informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own; or. (2) that performance of the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor. Abstract concepts like \"mature\" and \"best interest\" are rather amorphous at best. (True story: A respected law professor advised many classes of students that when confronted on the bar exam with a question about a child, do the following: Write \"best interest of the child\" somewhere in the first sentence; then write \"whatever the heck you want\" for the rest of the answer.) So then, the court must determine whether the minor is mature -- mature enough that she may have the court's permission to have an abortion. This means the court can then arrive at this Kafkaesque, perplexing alternative: A particular minor is too immature to have an abortion -- with the result being that this immature minor... should therefore be... a parent of an infant?  It gets stranger: What about a finding that it is in the best interest of the young mother to have the baby, even though she is deemed too immature to have an abortion? How would it be in the best interest of the immature mother to have a child? State courts and legislatures are not completely to blame; after all, the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line-drawing.

MacIntosh lured the boy, who has only one arm, to his hotel room in Lalitpur, a suburb south of the capital, Kathmandu, and repeatedly molested him, according to the Globe and Mail. Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh, 71, a businessman from the province of Nova Scotia, was sentenced to seven years in prison in Nepal for sexually molesting a boy (above Nepalese police escorting MacIntosh to his final hearing on Sunday) He arrived in Nepal on a tourist visa in August 2014 and was a frequent visitor to the children's shelter where the boy lived, and also gave the child promises of paying for a prosthetic arm while also offering him gifts and money.

{"article": "(CNN)A Chilean girl's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen: President Michelle Bachelet. Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease. Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system. Valentina's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal. Valentina's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant, according to her father, Freddy Maureira. The teen recently posted a video on her Facebook page, asking Bachelet to allow her to end her life. \"I am tired of living with this sickness,\" Valentina says in the video. \"Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever.\" Bachelet visited Valentina on Saturday for more than an hour at the hospital. The country's minister of health also attended. During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. The teen thanked Bachelet for the visit, and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter, according to CNN Chile. Before the visit, the President had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl. Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said. \"But what are we doing?\" Elizaldo said last week. \"The health ministry is in constant contact with Valentina's family, and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions.\" Valentina's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media. People took to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the debate on assisted suicide. One Twitter user posed the question in a tweet: \"After the case of Valentina Maureira, should euthanasia be legal?\" Doctor Andres Castillo, chief of pediatrics at Catholic University's Clinic Hospital, said that at the moment, Valentina's condition is stable.\" After her diagnosis, doctors expected her to live to about 17, which would give her three and a half more years to live.", "abstract": "Chilean President Michelle Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira, who has cystic fibrosis, after the teenager posted a video on Facebook asking the President to allow her to end her life.

His ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted Darren Sammy to wide long-on. Guptill was perhaps guilty of ball-watching when Ross Taylor was run out for 42 but, despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics, he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in ODIs with a single off Sulieman Benn. Corey Anderson was then caught by an off-pace delivery from Russell, shuffling across to pull the ball across to Gayle at midwicket for 15. Guptill's double-ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it, achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off Russell before partner Grant Elliott was dismissed on review.

He was embarrassed by Giorgio Chiellini for their goal, and he was lucky to get away with losing his man at the previous set-piece. When England were in possession, he didn\u2019t work hard enough to get on the ball \u2014 he was happy to let Chris Smalling bring the ball out.

Roy Hodgson's 'experiment' of playing Jones as a deep central midfielder didn't pay dividends. Read Martin Samuel's full match report from the Juventus Stadium. Out of possession, he often flew out in an attempt to deal with the danger. This is fine when he wins the ball, but a very risky tactic. In fairness, he dropped back nicely in between the centre halves regularly, which is clearly what he feels comfortable doing. The main problem is that he has a habit of chasing the ball when he can\u2019t win it. He looks like he\u2019s been fired out of a cannon! He\u2019ll need to assess situations better and hold his position in front of the back four. Sir Alex Ferguson famously labelled Jones the next Duncan Edwards, but he didn\u2019t look very Edwards-like. At 23, it feels like we\u2019re still trying to figure out his best position. He is being asked to play a role that needs to be filled by a more technically-proficient player \u2014 like Andrea Pirlo. Wayne Rooney looked excellent against Italy, like the elder statesman leading his younger team-mates. He does everything with intelligence and showed his quality with 30-yard diagonal balls and a fine effort against the crossbar. Wayne Rooney stepped to the fore in his role as captain and was unlucky not to score in Turin. England captain showed a good understanding with Harry Kane on their first start together. He also linked up really well with Harry Kane, especially in the second half. It looked like they had a kind of telepathic togetherness. I\u2019m sure that will be something Roy Hodgson will be keen to see more of in the future. It\u2019s interesting how, recently, strike partnerships have seemed like a thing of the past, but Rooney and Kane demonstrated they have an excellent understanding and play like a pair, not individuals. Jagielka shows why he's still valuable to Roy. When you look at Phil Jagielka\u2019s rise in international football, it has been completely without fanfare. He had a couple of hairy moments, but still looked the best defender on show in Turin, weighing in with countless clearances and blocks. He also reads the game very well. Everton centre-back Phil Jagielka proved he is England's best defender with a fuss-free performance. Jagielka fared better than fellow defender Chris Smalling who was forced to withdraw after feeling unwell. He was relegated to the Championship with Sheffield United in 2007 and bought by Everton, where he took a while to mature. But right now, he looks better than Smalling and Jones, who have had a lot more hype surrounding their breakthroughs into the England squad.

I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle. We can\u2019t be the Crystal Palace of last year, or the West Brom of this year. Digging in, blood and thunder, lump the ball in, protecting a lead, that\u2019s not us. Our squad is better on the ball, they\u2019re more suited to pushing for a place in the Europa League. Sherwood on his players stepping up. \u2018The players have a duty, a responsibility to fix this mess. I don\u2019t want to hear crap about how difficult it is to play at home. Playing for a big club comes with pressure. Anyone can do it for a lesser team \u2014 but you have to have b******s to play for Aston Villa. This is a big club. 'Aston Villa are like Everton... they're not a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle' Sherwood on not listening to criticism. \u2018When I was at Blackburn there were times when it was difficult. My name would be read out and there were a few groans. I didn\u2019t care. I\u2019d sometimes tell David Batty, \u201cI\u2019ll give it away more times than you\u2019ll get it this afternoon.\u201d Sherwood on Nabil Bentaleb. \u2018I\u2019d watched him in training. Every day was like his last on earth. He would cry if he lost a five-a-side. He played and never looked back. Sherwood says he loved the way Nabil Bentaleb 'played and never looked back' last season at Tottenham. Sherwood on telling Redknapp to take Bale off in the San Siro. \u2018Harry\u2019s going mad. \u201cGet f****** Gareth off?\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s the only f****** chance we\u2019ve got.\u201d He keeps him on, he scores a hat-trick, gets us back to 4-3 and if it goes another 10 minutes, we win. The kid\u2019s career springboards from that performance. Sherwood on playing with passion. \u2018The coaches used to call me Tackler Tim, or some rubbish. One day, I put one in and he said to Graham Taylor, \u201cWhy\u2019s he keep doing that?\u201d I\u2019ve never forgotten his answer. \u201cBrian, you know that shirt you wear on Saturday?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the shirt he wants.\u201d He was right, too. Take a player like Jack Grealish. I\u2019ve had lots of chats with Jack. He knows what I think. I tell him: \u201cI will take desire over ability every day\u201d. Obviously, the ability can\u2019t be too low. But if you have the ability \u2014 and he has \u2014 you\u2019ll make it if you have desire. Sherwood says you must have the desire and talent to make it at the top these days. The young manager was appointed last month to attempt to save Aston Villa's season. Sherwood on managing players. \u2018So I didn\u2019t come in here all guns blazing or wanting to be their headmaster. You can\u2019t get personal these days, get your hair cut, and all that nonsense. You\u2019ve got to move with the times. I left the stick at home, and the tickling brush. Now I feel I know them a bit better.

Alien forums say the image is 'evidence' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war. The satellite image shows a zoomed in section of Valles Marineris, a 2,500-mile (4,000km) long canyon on Mars, which was captured by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Scroll down for video. A striking image that allegedly shows a mushroom cloud (circled red) rising on Mars has been pounced on by conspiracy theorists. Alien forums say the image is 'evidence' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war. French Youtube channel UFOvni Disclosure has created a short film showing the 'cloud of smoke' which it claims could be either a nuclear explosion or extra-terrestrial methane. 'India's Mars orbiter captured something strange in the gigantic Valles Marineris Canyon of Mars,' the video says. 'The image shows a huge mushroom cloud and we may wonder whether it is an enormous rare dust wind cloud, or caused due to a nuclear or methane explosion.' The image was taken around the same time as the Siding Spring comet passed Mars last year. Pictured is a zoomed in version of what some believe is the alien mushroom cloud, showing the crater rim, stem explosion and cloud shadow.\u00a0The image was taken around the same time as the Siding Spring comet passed Mars on October 19 last year. 'At the moment of the close passage of (the comet) to the planet Nasa cut off the live feed,' said UFOvni Disclosure. 'But Dr Fritz Helmut Hemmerich was able to make a video from 1,200 metres at Tenerife in the Canary Islands showing (the comet) immediately after its Mars encounter and a huge explosion.' Dr Jonti Horner, astronomer at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia, told the Express: 'Fun as it would be to imagine that this is evidence of nuclear weapons on Mars...that's sadly just not the case.' He said looking images of the 'cloud' were an optical illusion caused by the angle of the crater with the trench. The theory that an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race is popular among conspiracy theorists. Last year, plasma physicist Dr John Brandenburg said he believed ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today. Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion. 'At the moment of the close passage of (the comet) to the planet Nasa cut off the live feed,' said UFOvni Disclosure. This screenshot compares the two images of the same area, with the cloud is only seen on the left. A scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on Mars was massacred. Dr Brandenburg is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in Illinois at the American Physical Society. He says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on Mars (image from his paper shown) 'The Martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on Mars,' he told Fox News at the time. 'A nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet.' But since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race. According to Vice, the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests'may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space.' His research centres around the 'high concentration' of Xenon-129 in the Martian atmosphere, and uranium and thorium on the surface, spotted by Nasa's Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Dr Brandenburg says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past, including Cydonia, the location of the famous 'face on Mars' spotted from orbit (left). However, later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes (right) Aside from this outlandish theory, Dr John Brandenburg has led a rather more normal, and prestigious, career. He has a PhD in Theoretical Plasma Physics from the University of California at Davis. Currently he works as a plasma physicist at Orbital Technologies in Madison Wisconsin. He has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on Space Missile Defense and Directed Energy Weapons. Dr Brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest, Death on Mars: The Discovery of a Planetary Nuclear Massacre, to be published in February 2015. Scientists have previously pointed about that the appearance of these elements is not surprising, as they are natural elements found everywhere. But Dr Brandenburg is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear", "abstract": "Conspiracy theorists have claimed that a mushroom cloud rising on Mars is evidence that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war.

'I didn't because at that time we had a bipartisan agreement that it should be closed.' The prison had 242 detainees when Obama began his presidency. According to Obama, the politics around closure grew increasingly tough and 'people got scared by the rhetoric.' Obama made the comment during a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio on Wednesday. He said Wednesday that 'the path of least resistance was just to leave it open.'

{"article": "Labour's flagship energy price freeze was in further chaos last night as Ed Miliband was forced to re-launch it as a drive to cut fuel costs. His pledge to freeze bills for 20 months was left in turmoil earlier this year by tumbling wholesale prices. Today, the Labour leader will announce that he would pass a law to force the regulator Ofgem to push prices down by up to \u00a3100 this winter. Scroll down for video. Ed Miliband has been forced to clarify his energy policy after tumbling wholesale prices demolished the concept of a price freeze, and now he says he will force suppliers to drop bills by \u00a3100 this winter. But critics pointed out that when he announced the price freeze, in a blaze of publicity in 2013, he called for Ofgem to be abolished. His officials are now drafting legislation to allow Ofgem to \u2018put an immediate end to the overcharging by the Big Six energy firms\u2019 which costs families and business around \u00a32.5billion a year. Labour was forced to \u2018rebrand\u2019 the proposed freeze as a price cap when power companies started reducing household fuel bills earlier this year in response to falling wholesale costs. The party had to issue a \u2018clarification\u2019 that they would also allow household energy bills to fall and they would not be frozen at a higher level than necessary. Mr Miliband had been criticised for intervening in the market and the industry warned it would put investment in jeopardy. The Conservatives have pointed out that if energy prices had been frozen when Mr Miliband announced the policy, it would have meant families paying bills \u00a3100 higher than necessary today. If Miliband had frozen gas prices when he announced his policy back in 2013, households would now be paying \u00a3100 more than necessary after falling wholesale prices drove down bills. Opponents of Mr Miliband say this mistake reveals the danger of meddling in a free market, and warn that any further intervention could risk investment and jobs. Last night energy minister Matt Hancock said: \u2018This is now the sixth version of a chaotic Labour energy policy that would have put up families\u2019 bills by \u00a3100 and could do the same again \u2013 their record at setting prices has been a disaster. \u2018And only Ed Miliband could propose giving a new power to a regulator he plans to scrap. This incompetence is exactly why Ed Miliband isn\u2019t up to the job. Hardworking taxpayers would pay the price with higher bills.\u2019 Mr Miliband will say today that in one of his first bills of the next Parliament, he would give Ofgem \u2018a legal duty to review prices by the autumn \u2013 and the power to order price reductions in time for the winter\u2019. He will accuse the Conservatives of failing to stand up to \u2018vested interests\u2019. \u2018We live in a country where you can\u2019t fulfil one of the foundations of family life \u2013 keeping your home warm \u2013 without being overcharged by one of the big energy firms\u2019, he will say. \u2018It\u2019s been 18 months since I announced the next Labour government would freeze energy bills \u2013 so they can only go down and not up \u2013 until 2017 while we reset this broken market.\u2019 Labour says prices are tumbling \u2018not because of anything the Government or the Big Six energy firms have done, but because of global changes in oil and gas supply\u2019.

{"article": "Researchers  found a link between milk consumption and higher levels of anti-oxidant which might minimise damage to brain cells. Drinking three glasses of milk a day could help stave off diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, say researchers. A new US study shows a link between milk consumption and higher levels of a naturally-occurring antioxidant called glutathione in the brain in older, healthy adults. The powerful antioxidant may minimise damage to brain cells from free radicals, destructive groups of atoms made as a by-product of metabolism that can damage cells. Antioxidants help to neutralise this type of oxidative stress in the body. The study was carried out at the University of Kansas Medical Center by associate professor of neurology In-Young Choi and Debra Sullivan, professor and chair of dietetics and nutrition. Dr Sullivan said \u2018We have long thought of milk as being very important for your bones and very important for your muscles. \u2018This study suggests that it could be important for your brain as well.\u2019 Altogether 60 adults enrolled in the study were asked about their diets in the days leading up to brain scans to monitor levels of glutathione in the brain. The researchers found those who said they had drunk milk recently had more glutathione in their brains. Those who drank around three glasses a day had highest levels, says a report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (must credit). Oxidative stress is known to be associated with a number of different diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and many other conditions, say the researchers. Dr Choi said \u2018Antioxidants are a built-in defence system for our body to fight against this damage, and the levels of antioxidants in our brain can be regulated by various factors such as diseases and lifestyle choices.\u2019 Dr Sullivan said \u2018You can basically think of this damage like the build up of rust on your car. \u2018If left alone for a long time, the build up increases and it can cause damaging effects. \u2018If we can find a way to fight this by instituting lifestyle changes including diet and exercise, it could have major implications for brain health.\u2019 For the study, researchers used high-tech brain scanning equipment housed at KU Medical Center\u2019s Hoglund Brain Imaging Center. Study found people who drank three glasses of milk a day had the highest level of anti-oxident glutathione. Dr Choi said \u2018Our equipment enables us to understand complex processes occurring that are related to health and disease. \u2018The advanced magnetic resonance technology allowed us to be in a unique position to get the best pictures of what was going on in the brain.\u2019 An editorial in the journal said the study presented \u2018a provocative new benefit of the consumption of milk in older individuals\u2019. There have been mixed findings in studies on the health benefits of milk. A study from Oxford University suggested milk drinking might mitigate neurological damage leading to diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s due to its vitamin B12 content. A randomised, controlled trial that seeks to determine the precise effect of milk consumption on the brain is still needed and is a logical next step, the researchers said.", "abstract": "Drinking three glasses of milk a day could help stave off diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, according to a new US study.

Whether it\u2019s watching Real Sociedad\u2019s next La Liga opponents on DVD, learning the language with his demanding tutor or sampling another tasty Basque speciality dish from the atmospheric pintxos bars, Moyes can\u2019t escape it. But he does like to switch off now and again and turn his attention to the Scotland national team. He will watch Gordon Strachan\u2019s side on the television this week as they play Northern Ireland and then the Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar. Moyes has been a manager at the highest level for more than a decade with Manchester United, Everton and now La Real, and he understands the scrutiny and intensity fellow bosses face from boardrooms, fans and media. Real Sociedad manager David Moyes has been impressed with Scotland boss Gordon Strachan. Strachan, pictured in November, is preparing his side for their match against Northern Ireland. That is why he has nothing but admiration for the job Strachan is doing. The national team sit in a decent position in Group D, in third place with seven points from four games. The weekend\u2019s fixture should be comfortable. Moyes hopes so and believes Strachan and his players have the determination and ability to be at the party in 2016. \u2018Gordon is doing a fabulous job. He has everybody believing again but it\u2019s good that there is a measured amount of optimism and nobody in the country has any stupid levels of expectation,\u2019 Moyes told Sportsmail. \u2018We\u2019ve had unrealistic ambitions in years gone by and it hasn\u2019t done us any favours. \u2018There is belief, and rightly so. I think we are introducing more and more young players and they have taken to it very well. \u2018The more experienced players are maturing nicely and the fact a few of them have Champions League experience certainly helps. \u2018All things considered, Gordon is doing a quite brilliant job. The 1-0 win against Republic of Ireland was an important victory. Gordon will want to kick on and make sure there is a win on Sunday. Darren Fletcher (far left) impressed Moyes during their time together at Manchester United. Moyes (left) worked with Fletcher (right) during his brief stint as the manager of the Manchester United. \u2018But he doesn\u2019t have a magic wand. It\u2019s difficult being a national manager because you can\u2019t buy a new centre half or a new left back, you have to work with what you\u2019ve got. That means you have to get the very best out of the players, try to improve them in order to maximise their standards when they play. \u2018I\u2019m not going to add to the pressure by saying I expect Scotland to qualify. What I will say is that I hope they do. \u2018We last reached a Finals 17 years ago and I was in France to support them. I was manager of Preston and also used it as an opportunity to enhance my knowledge by taking in games and sessions. \u2018If we qualify for 2016, I will be there again.\u2019 Moyes hopes two of his former players \u2014 Darren Fletcher and Steven Naismith \u2014 continue their good work at this level. Moyes signed Naismith for Everton after Rangers went into liquidation and the player exercised his right to leave for no fee. It was a no-brainer to sign him under such circumstances. The versatile star is now valued in excess of \u00a38million. Moyes is delighted Fletcher is back in the international fold after successfully battling a chronic bowel disease. He worked with the midfielder at Old Trafford and has huge respect for him. Moyes signed Scotland international Steven Naismith for \u00a38million from Rangers back in July 2012. When Moyes lost his job at United in April of last year, Fletcher was one of the first on the phone to text offering sympathy and expressing regret at the way it all worked out. \u2018Darren is a superb person and a great footballer,\u2019 Moyes said. \u2018I had the pleasure of working with him and he was an even better player than I thought. He was great in the dressing room, trustworthy and had the best interests of the club at heart. \u2018His health problems were well documented but he never once complained. I hold Darren in high regard. I\u2019m delighted he is relishing the responsibility of captaining West Brom. \u2018Stevie Naismith is a good lad. He really has come on leaps and bounds at Everton. \u2018It was always going to be difficult for him in his first year when he came from Rangers. But he has listened and developed into an important member of the Everton team because he can play a number of different roles. \u2018Gordon will be pleased to have guys such as Darren and Stevie. \u2018They are excellent senior professionals and the perfect examples for the", "abstract": "David Moyes, the manager of Real Sociedad, has praised Scotland boss Gordon Strachan for the job he is doing with the national team.

Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch Friday's solar eclipse amid fears they could be blinded. The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres.

A second school in the area, Fairwater Primary School, said it would not be making any changes to the school day to accommodate the eclipse. Meanwhile, Bryn Hafod Primary School, also in the area, said it needed to do a 'health and safety assessment' before it would make a decision on whether to allow children to watch the eclipse. During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse. Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole.

The nutrionist also explained what kefir is, and why it's good for you. 'Kefir results when milk is combined with bacteria and allowed to ferment,' she said. 'It is high in protein and will help with the recovery of your muscles.' Wholewheat pitta and hummus can provide much needed carbs and protein whilst pineapple, rich in an enzyme called bromelain, is useful for preventing injuries.

The wholewheat pita is a good source of slow releasing carbs to keep your energy levels up. Sweet potato (left) is a nutritionally dense carb whilst green vegetables (right) will help prevent fatigue. Fermented milk kefir is high in protein and will help with muscle recovery. Pineapple. Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain. Bromelain helps with digesting protein and is a helpful anti-inflammatory which is useful for preventing injuries. Pineapple also contains fibre, vitamin B6, manganese and is a great source of Vitamin C. Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme. Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training. The green veg provides vitamins A and C which support the immune system to function normally, which is hampered with hard training. Sweet potato. Try a starchy vegetable such as sweet potato for a nutritionally dense carbohydrate snack after your workout. Sweet potato is just as delicious whether eaten hot or cold. Fish and chips. Opt for a healthy version of fish and chips. Go for an oily fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines or anchovies.

At least 65,000 patients are now going overseas for surgery and other procedures each year \u2013 twice as many as a decade ago. One of the most popular destinations is Poland, for cataract treatment, as well as Spain, where couples are going for IVF. Medical professionals also say young women are increasingly travelling to countries such as Thailand and Turkey for cheap cosmetic surgery, including tummy tucks and breast implants. Many are combining the trip with a holiday, so they can recover in the sun while avoiding awkward questions back home. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that 65,000 patients went abroad for treatment in 2013, paying a combined \u00a3129.3million. A decade ago, the figure was around 32,000 a year. The head of one firm, which arranges overseas treatment, said there was a growing demand for those wanting cataract surgery, hip and knee replacements and IVF. All of these procedures are deemed \u2018non-urgent\u2019 on the NHS and so have long waiting times or are no longer offered at all. Ugur Samut, chief executive of Medigo, said the number of queries for all types of treatment had trebled in the past six months. \u2018We believe demand has increased recently due to longer waiting lists and postcode lotteries for some procedures on the NHS.\u2019 Tuck on the cheap: Medical professionals say young women are increasingly travelling to countries such as Thailand and Turkey for cheap cosmetic surgery, including tummy tucks and breast implants.

Hungary is the second most common, mainly for dental procedures which are expensive in England and where patients have to pay even for NHS treatment. Spain is popular for couples seeking IVF, Thailand for laser eye surgery and Turkey for liposuction, the removal of body fat. Barry Wilson, 60, from Birmingham, went to a private clinic in Poland last July for cataract surgery after being told he would have to wait eight months on the NHS. The entire trip including flights, hotels and the treatment cost less than \u00a31,000. He said: \u2018It\u2019s very daunting to travel to another country for surgery. My surgeon put me at ease at my consultation. I would return again, with no worries.\u2019 But Keith Pollard of website Treatment Abroad, which offers advice to patients going overseas, said the rise was mainly driven by adults wanting cosmetic surgery. He said: \u2018One reason is the increase in disposable income. People are prepared to spend more on cosmetic surgery. \u2018The other is that it has become more socially acceptable to travel abroad for treatment.\u2019 Nonetheless, hospital waiting lists in England are at a six-year high, with almost 12,000 patients facing delays of at least six months for routine operations.

The Shadow Chancellor launched a Labour dossier suggesting three Government departments \u2013 the Foreign Office, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Transport \u2013 would \u2018disappear\u2019 if the Tories kept cutting spending at the current rate. Later however, Mr Balls was forced to admit that even he did not believe the Foreign Office would be abolished. Scroll down for video. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (pictured at a conference yesterday) has been accused of having \u2018lost his marbles\u2019 after painting an \u2018apocalyptic\u2019 picture of Britain under another five years of a Tory government. The Tories said their plan to eliminate the deficit was necessary and accused Mr Balls of \u2018absurd scaremongering\u2019. The 31-page Labour document painted a bleak picture of life under a Conservative \u201835 per cent state\u2019, a reference to plans to reduce public spending as a proportion of GDP. It suggested police cuts would fuel crime, a third of elderly people who receive state-funded social care would have it stopped and the NHS \u2018as we know it\u2019 would cease to exist. George Osborne\u2019s \u20181930s plans\u2019 would also mean the Army being reduced to its smallest size since Cromwell, the dossier suggested. Mr Balls insisted a Conservative Government would have to make \u00a370billion of spending cuts to eliminate the budget deficit by 2017/18. He suggested avoiding some of the \u2018extreme cuts\u2019 outlined in the document would be possible only by raising VAT, slashing the NHS budget or imposing charges for healthcare. But he declined to set out how much spending Labour would cut if it regains office, or where the axe would fall. Asked if he \u2018seriously believed that the Conservatives will close down the Foreign Office or close down the Department for Transport or close down the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019, Mr Balls said: \u2018No I don\u2019t think that.\u2019 When asked why such scenarios were included in the dossier, he said: \u2018Because what the document says is if the Government was to do those spending cuts, which are bigger in the next parliament than in this parliament, on the same basis as in this parliament, that would mean closing the Foreign Office and the DWP. We don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that.\u2019 Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts. The Tories accused Ed Balls (pictured above) of \u2018absurd scaremongering\u2019 after he launched a Labour dossier which suggested three Government departments could disappear under the a Conservative government. Even the BBC\u2019s assistant political editor Norman Smith described the scenario as \u2018an apocalypse\u2019. A Labour aide added that the document had set out an \u2018implausible scenario\u2019 to illustrate the difficulty of the Tories achieving their deficit reduction plan. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said the analysis was \u2018nonsense\u2019. He said his party had pledged to cut \u00a330billion in the next parliament \u2013 \u00a313billion from departmental budgets, \u00a312billion from welfare and \u00a35billion from closing tax loopholes. It sounds like the politics of the playground. Former Labour star James Purnell claims he and Ed Miliband aren\u2019t friends any more. The ex-culture minister, now the BBC\u2019s strategy chief, gave an interview saying he had always been close to Mr Miliband. But he later called the London Evening Standard journalist to insist: \u2018When I said I was friends with Ed, that\u2019s not completely right. I\u2019m not friends with Ed any more.\u2019 The exchange simultaneously raises questions about the BBC\u2019s left wing ties and sheds light on insecurity among its upper ranks. \u2018I think Balls has lost his marbles on this,\u2019 he said. \u2018He is making up a set of figures today and I think fairly ludicrously already having to back track from his speech in which he claimed the next Conservative government would be closing down major government departments. \u2018That\u2019s a sign of how chaotic Labour is.\u2019 Mr Balls insisted that to achieve a budget surplus by the end of the next parliament, Mr Osborne would have to deliver \u2018colossal cuts\u2019 to public spending. \u2018An unprecedented \u00a370billion of spending cuts would be deeply destructive and close to impossible, even for this Chancellor,\u2019 he said. \u2018So George Osborne must surely have an alternative plan in his back pocket. These would lead to the smallest police force since comparable records began, the smallest Army since Cromwell, and over a third of older people receiving social care losing their entitlement to it. \u2018There is a real risk that the Chancellor will be forced to break his promise to ring", "abstract": "The Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, has been accused of scaremongering after launching a Labour dossier suggesting that three Government departments would disappear if the Tories kept cutting spending at the current rate.

Manuel Pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current City manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season. Mancini, the man who led Manchester City to its first Premier League title in 44 years back in 2012 says Pellegrini is \"lucky\" to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning England's top division. Pellegrini, who led City to the domestic title last season, is under fire with City trailing Chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the European Champions League. \"I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players,\" Inter Milan coach Mancini told CNN's Don Riddell on the eve of City's crucial game with Barcelona in the Champions League. \"I think City can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year.\" Nicknamed \"the Engineer,\" Pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side's title charge in recent weeks. The Chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its Premier League title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow Burnley last weekend. His team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night. City faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the European Champions League -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season. It must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture. Only once in nine attempts has Barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged Champions League knockout tie and not progressed. Pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at City but a number of those purchases have failed to impress. Eliaquim Mangala, who arrived from Porto for $47million has endured a dismal first season in English football, while $32million man Stevan Jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from Fiorentina. \"It's my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League,\" said Mancini. \"It's in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it's the best team. \"In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute,\" perhaps a nod to City's last gasp English Premier League title win in 2012, thanks to Sergio Aguero's stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers. \"I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title.\" Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes in December 2009, enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure. He led the club to the FA Cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season. Under Mancini, the club attracted star players such as Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Aguero. He signed a new five-year deal with the club in July 2012 but results dipped with rival Manchester United regaining the league title and City suffering a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wigan. Mancini was criticised for his side's lack of success in the Champions League, where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties. The Italian, 50, was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with Carlos Tevez, the Argentina striker, which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the City squad. In the 12 Champions League ties under his stewardship, City managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team's failure on the European stage. At the time of his sacking, the club said that Mancini failed to hit \"stated targets\" and that it wanted to \"develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football\". \"I had a fantastic time in England,\" he added. \"We won the Premier League after many years. I have all City's supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this. \"Maybe I miss the Premier League because I worked there for three-and-a-half years. I built the team that is now in second position. \"I think they play with the same players and I am very proud of this.\" Mancini faces a struggle of his own at Inter with the club unlikely to qualify for European competition next season.

'Second, I wanted to meet and shake hands for the transaction and discuss your offering of working with you in the future as you stated you have built Facebook on connections that you have with others in Silicon Valley.' He also told Zuckerberg one of the reasons he  sold him the house, aside from privacy, was 'your offering to help me get my homes, development projects, in front of your Facebook employees'. Voskerician says that although both he and Zuckerberg agreed on the deal, nothing was put into writing. However, the Facebook founder's lawyers have strongly denied the claims. Email exchanges suggest that Zuckerberg and his inner circle had no intention of helping Voskerician in anything other than a 'light' way. But the developer's lawyer has disputed this. Unless both parties reach a deal, the case will go to trial. If Voskerician wins, he may be awarded back the property, situated in Hamilton Avenue in the once-ordinary California area. Couple: After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the property, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million.

{"article": "A security guard shone a laser pen at the cockpits of passenger planes and a police helicopter while bored on coffee breaks at work. Mark Savage, 27, targeted aircrafts coming in to land at Southampton Airport but claims he was\u00a0'was just mucking around' and 'wasn't thinking'. Twice he aimed the beam at passenger planes, one of which was carrying 28 people - but despite risking lives with his reckless behaviour, Savage, of Hampshire, walked free from court today. Spared jail:\u00a0Mark Savage said he 'was just mucking around' when he shone a laser pen into the cockpits of passenger planes and was spared a prison sentence after a judge heard how he had mental health problems. Sparing him jail, a judge warned how his actions could have caused a crash and stated he 'could not think of anything more dangerous' to do. Recorder Michael Vere-Hodge QC made the decision  after Southampton Crown Court heard how Savage had mental health problems. He shone a beam at a cockpit of a Bombardier Q400 plane on a flight from Jersey that was preparing to land at Southampton Airport just before 9pm on September 9 last year, the court heard. Prosecutor Edward Phillips told the court co-pilot Edward Jarman was reaching a critical point in the landing stage when he saw a light reflecting off the plane's window. Dangerous: Savage aimed the laser beam at several aircrafts including a Flybe plane, which was carrying 28 passengers, forcing the captain\u00a0to switch off his external lights to land. Mr Phillips said: 'Fortunately the light wasn't in his eyes. He recognised the potential danger but was able to land the plane safely.' A similar Flybe plane behind, captained by Matthew Donnellan, was carrying 28 passengers and three other crew members and was coming in from Paris, France. Mr Phillips said Captain Donnellan had previously suffered temporary blindness and disorientation after a beam had been shone into his eyes so was considerably concerned when he spotted the light from Savage's pen. He made the decision to switch off his external lights, a call he would not usually make, but he considered it less of a risk than being blinded by the laser and was able to land safely. He shone a beam (like the one pictured) at a cockpit of a Bombardier Q400 plane on a flight from Jersey that was preparing to land at Southampton Airport. An image from a previous unrelated incident, in which a laser pen was shone at a helicopter, demonstrates the blinding effect the device can have on pilots. Mr Phillips said the matter was reported to police, who launched the force helicopter and found the source of light was coming from a compound near the Itchen Bridge in Southampton. The pen was discovered under a rock and Savage was arrested and taken to the police station where he admitted being responsible. Savage said he was 'just mucking around' and 'wasn't thinking' and accepted shining it at four or five planes on coffee breaks. Savage, from Totton, Hants, admitted three charges of negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger aircraft. He received a six month suspended sentence with 12 months supervision. David Storry, defending, said his autism and lack of understanding of consequences explains why he shone the light at planes. He said: 'A reasonable person would know the potential consequences of what he was doing. He didn't think through the consequences of his actions and carried on doing it. Also targeted: A Hampshire Police helicopter (like the one above) was called out and officers traced the source of the light and were able to arrest\u00a0Savage, who admitted responsibility. 'One of his problems is that he gets bored very easily, lacks concentration and acts impulsively. 'He fully understands the case against him. The difficulty is the lack of understanding of the implications of his actions.' Urging the court to impose a suspended sentence, Mr Storry said: 'He is vulnerable and wouldn't take well to a prison regime. He would be a fish out of water.' Recorder Vere-Hodge QC said: 'They were flying over urban areas and if the planes had crash landed, there would have a likely high level number of injuries and damage. 'I cannot think of anything more dangerous in our modern world than shining a beam into the eyes of people flying aircraft. 'I hope you have got it into your head the amount of damage you nearly did and you will never, never put yourself into this kind of situation again.'", "abstract": "Mark Savage, a security guard, has been spared jail after shining a laser pen at the cockpits of passenger planes and a police helicopter while bored on coffee breaks at work.

With implants: Courtney O'Keefe is pictured here, with her implants, after spending more than six months in hospital for a deadly infection.

Ms O'Keefe is pictured here following her double mastectomy, holding both of her implants in each hand. The implants were removed on December 17. Ms O'Keefe has not worked since she was struck down by the infection. Ms O'Keefe said she was in 'agony' upon returning to Australia and her mother whisked her to hospital shortly after she arrived back home in Perth. 'We went straight to Armidale Emergency,' she said. 'I was there for 5 minutes and she admitted me up to a room. 'I was in an isolation room becaues they didnt have any clue what I had... They swabbed, and it took four days to figure out what it was.' It was the beginning of a six month ordeal, with Ms O'Keefe spending time at both Armidale and Fremantle hospitals. She was diagnosed with the rare bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, which the Centre for Disease Control said is often contracted by patients in hospital, particularly those with wounds from surgery or hooked up to medical devices. Ms O'Keefe is pictured here after her stay in hospital, when she still had implants. Her condition worsened. 'It was also turning septic and was starting to shut down my liver, my kidneys, my heart, my brain,' she said. 'Mum and Dad had to come and say goodbye to me twice,' said Ms O'Keefe. Doctors called in respected specialists to treat the condition, and they concocted a special substance to fight it. A PIC (peripherally inserted central catheter) was installed inside her so she could receive a constant stream of antibiotics. On December 17, 2014, nearly a year after her ordeal, surgeons removed her implants because the infection had returned. Because the infection had spread to her surrounding tissue, both her breasts were also removed. 'I will never be able to life a normal life': Ms O'Keefe is pictured following the surgery to remove both of her breasts. But her ordeal is not completely over.\u00a0Ms O'Keefe has suffered kidney and liver problems because of the medication required to treat her infection. She told Daily Mail Australia she had coughed up blood and that doctors said she may require surgery if she does not improve. She lost her job and has not worked since the ordeal began. She had to move back in with her mother. And she's devastated. 'I'm never going to live a normal life,' she said. Ms O'Keefe urged Australians examining plastic surgery overseas to reconsider.

This, surely, is the worst yet, worse than 1996 when Sri Lanka\u2019s pinch-hitters left them trailing in their wake. Worse, even, than 1999 when England were eliminated from their own World Cup the day before the official song came out. And it is certainly worse than the last three World Cups when we had come to expect England to struggle in the one-day game, particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited-overs cricket followed the Ashes.

England batsman Moeen lays on the ground after being run out by Bangladesh wicketkeeper Rahim during the World Cup match. The 15-run defeat here by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval, which confirmed England\u2019s abject surrender, is nothing short of an utter humiliation, an embarrassment that, not for the first time in recent years, leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket. This was the World Cup that England were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for. This was the World Cup that the Ashes were moved for, leading to a 5-0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations. Yet so far advanced has the one-day game progressed in the last two years since England reached the Champions Trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one-day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. England have been able to defeat just Scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka they have now been humbled by a team in Bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves. This tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter-finals. It was almost impossible for England to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace. Or so it seemed. Instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace. It is one that leaves Peter Moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of England and Paul Downton, the man who appointed him, facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made. When the dust settles and England have gone through the motions of their last group match against Afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one-day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next World Cup in four years time. It is not just Moores and Downton with much to contemplate.\u00a0Senior players such as Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one-day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built. And the decision to replace Alastair Cook with Eoin Morgan as one-day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired, the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most. Morgan has been given permission to miss England\u2019s first one-day international after this World Cup, against an Ireland team having a far better tournament than England, so he can play in the Indian Premier League. That decision frankly stinks and if Morgan does not want to lead England into a new one-day era then he should give up the job now and let Joe Root, who was seriously considered when Cook was sacked, lead them from now on. Never mind that Jos Buttler almost rescued England after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275. And never mind that TV umpire Simon Fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that Chris Jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground.

{"article": "It was the final minute of a one-sided game and Everton winger Christian Atsu set off on one last attack. Sprinting in front of him was Ross Barkley and Atsu wasted no time sending the England man clear. As Tim Krul raced out, Barkley danced around him, the ball never leaving his feet and - with the goal at his mercy - he gracefully applied the finishing touch. Goodison Park, at long last, was exultant and all around this old stadium, fans punched the air in celebration. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez was a little more reserved but there is no doubt a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. This was a big day for the manager and his team, but they came through it with panache. In the end they beat Newcastle 3-0 but that score might have been six. Click here to read Dominic King's full match report. Host commentator. Everton move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with what turned out to be a comfortable win for the home side in the end. The Toffees took the lead through James McCarthy before Romelu Lukaku added a second from the penalty spot. Everton's day was made easier when Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous lunging tackle on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley added a third in the closing stages of the match. Substitute Ross Barkley shows Kone how it is done by rounding Krul before placing the ball into an empty net. Kone rounds Krul after dodging several challenges from Newcastle's defenders but he runs out of space to score. He probably should have squared the ball to a team-mate but his goalscoring instinct saw him try to score a goal of his own. Atsu comes on for the final five minutes of this afternoon's match at Goodison Park. Sissoko, who is captaining Newcastle following Coloccini's sending off, made Howard make his first real save of the afternoon with a powerful shot at goal. Howard made a good save to his left before shouting at his defenders. Osman, who has been in impressive form, just tested Krul with an effort but the Dutchman was able to palm the ball to safety. The Toffees are not exactly pushing for a third goal but I suppose they are content with their two-goal advantage. Newcastle, on the other hand, are starting to tire due to their numerical disadvantage. Gutierrez replaces Riviere as 10-man Newcastle attempt to close up shop. They know they are out of the game now so it's just a case of keeping the scoreline down to as low as possible. Newcastle's day has been made even worse as their captain has been sent off for a disgusting challenge - if you can call it that - on Lennon. He was incredibly late and his studs were raised as he made a lazy attempt to win back possession for his side. Carver throws on Cabella for Ameobi immediately after Everton's second. Lukaku adds a crucial second goal by converting the penalty from 12 yards. He slots the ball past Krul before running away in celebration. Gouffran is penalised for a clumsy tackle on Aaron Lennon. Kone is being given the time and space to dictate play in the middle of the park but his final pass leaves a lot to be desired. Ayoze Perez came on at half-time in place of Obertan. A positive move by John Carver, who will feel his side can get something out of today's game. Just to recap, here's how McCarthy scored his first goal of the season for Everton. That strike could be pivotal in terms of the Toffees' hopes of staying in the Premier League. A nervous Everton side go into the interval with a 1-0 lead. McCarthy's goal was somewhat fortunate as Krul should have done a lot better but the Toffees will take any kind of fortune given this position in the league. The home crowd are starting to vent their frustrations at Everton despite still being in the lead. Toffees fans will be desperate for their side to open up a two-goal lead in order to ensure they take all three points. The Toffees have grown in confidence since taking the lead through McCarthy. Kone appears to be enjoying a free role just behind Lukaku, while the Belgium international is holding the ball up well. Baines is starting to have some joy down the left. Janmaat is struggling to deal with Baines' runs from deeps. The England left back could have some joy today. Nice moment at Goodison Park. Jonas Gutierrez has just started warming up, running alongside the Family Enclosure towards the Gwladys Street end, both of which are the domain of home supporters. As he made his way to the corner flag on his short shuttle sprint, there was spontaneous applause from Evertonians, a mark of respect for what he has been through.

The brunette is back in London following news that her U.S. TV career has faltered at the first hurdle as NBC decided not to continue with negotiations following a 'cringeworthy' pilot. But the 31-year-old seemed to have put her any career troubles behind her today as she laughed and joked with a friend in London.

Pippa will be an aunt again soon, as her sister Kate is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William next month. And the former party planner was hoping to have more to celebrate this summer as she tried out for a high profile role on American TV.

Pippa will be an aunt again soon, as her sister Kate is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William next month.

Pippa had been in talks to join American TV station NBC as a'special correspondent', but negotiations for the \u00a3400,000 role disintegrated after she was deemed not to have a 'breezy' enough manner. The Vanity Fair Contributing Editor and Ocado magazine columnist, who was catapulted to fame following her sister's wedding to Prince William in 2011, has long been keen to make a name for herself in the U.S. But a source close to NBC says Pippa\u2019s screen trial, which can be watched online, was a flop. In the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for no ascertainable reason. And came across as \u2018a bit grand, awkward and bored, rather than enthusiastic\u2019, according to one insider. \u2018Cringe-worthy\u2019 said another. Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the'stunning' mountain scenery. 'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.' Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. 'It\u2019s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued.

Jean Delance, a junior at North Mesquite High School in Texas, who has de-committed from the University of Oklahoma after a video of a campus fraternity emerged showing racist chanting. The footage of the university's chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, also shows at least one woman at the back of the bus clapping her hands along with the vile song, 'There will never be a n***** in SAE.' In a television interview on KTVT in Dallas, Delance described the video as'very disturbing' and the people in it as 'uneducated'. He said: 'It is very distrubing, I never thought that stuff was still as trendy as back then or that it keeps repeating itself.' He also spoke of his disappointment that Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops did not call him to alert him of the situation. The now-infamous video shows with at least one of the chanting young men wearing a tuxedo, left, while a woman, right claps along with the chant.

{"article": "A man who married and impregnated a 12-year-old girl has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years in jail for persistent sexual abuse. Judge Deborah Sweeney said on Friday the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. He then'married her' before he sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions between January 11 and February 5 last year. The Australian girl was pregnant when her 26-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. A 27-year-old man has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars. The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW,\u00a0in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the man told the court today that 'his cultural and religious beliefs doesn't excuse his behaviour'. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, the girl was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and then miscarried in February after complaining of  abdominal pain. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. The man pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court in October to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence. The 27-year-old Lebanese student and the 12-year-old Australian girl spent their wedding night as a motel in the Hunter region of NSW where they had sex several times. The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged. He was ordered not to contact his victim for two years. Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier last year. The girl's father will face trial this year. The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly arranged the illegal marriage. The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He was charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013 \u00a0after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl\u2019s legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. The man has had his student visa cancelled and is now living in an immigration detention centre.", "abstract": "A 27-year-old Lebanese man, who married and impregnated a 12-year-old Australian girl, has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years in jail for persistent sexual abuse.

Trevino may also face charges for several abductions and murders. Trevino's give name is Alejandro, but he has had multiple aliases and nicknames, including 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42.' The arrest of Morales comes just days after the capture of Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.

Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.' \u2018Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,\u2019 said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

Once the flashpoint for the worst of the violence, security in northern Mexico has improved considerably, except for the lawless northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, said Raul Benitez. Founded in the late 1990s by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the powerful Gulf cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest criminal syndicates in Mexico. But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.

{"article": "Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Ennis-Hill\u2019s burgeoning rivalry has all the ingredients to propel athletics into the spotlight in a similar manner to the Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett clashes which captivated sports fans in the 1980s. \u2018They could have a rivalry like Steve and I had,\u2019 said Lord Coe. \u2018Head-to-heads are what get people excited. My kids got up at the weekend to watch Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. The more opportunities we have for athletes going head-to-head, the better. It\u2019s what people talk about. \u2018It\u2019s actually not just the thought of Jess and Kat but you have Morgan Lake, too, coming through and I\u2019m sure she will be equally good. It\u2019s an extraordinary period to be entering.\u2019 Katarina Johnson-Thompson won the World Indoor's in Prague, Czech Republic to become world No 1. Jessica Ennis-Hill is the Olympic Champion and her future rivalry with Johnson-Thompson is 'exciting' Johnson-Thompson, 22, is the World\u2019s No 1 hept-athlete and broke Ennis-Hill\u2019s British record at the European Indoor Championships in Prague this month. Her blistering form \u2014 coupled with murmurs from the Ennis-Hill camp that her training for a comeback after the birth of son Reggie is going very well \u2014 has set the scene for a mouthwatering duel. The pair are understandably keen to play down talk of a rivalry, Johnson-Thompson out of reverence for the Olympic champion of whom she claims to be \u2018in awe\u2019 and Ennis-Hill because she is unsure what competitive shape she will be in. But those charged with promoting the sport are keen to make the most of the fact that Britain boasts the world\u2019s two leading multi-eventers. They were expected to compete against each other for the first time since London 2012 \u2014 when Johnson-Thompson was 15th \u2014 at the Hypo-Meeting at the end of May, when the world\u2019s leading heptathletes descend on the Austrian alpine town Gotzis. But Brendan Foster revealed to Sportsmail that he is trying to set up a head-to-head for earlier that month at the Great CityGames in Manchester. Lord Sebastian Coe wants the heptathletes to have an exciting duel like he did with Steve Ovett in the 1980s. \u2018Kat has already agreed to do the 200 metres hurdles and long jump,\u2019 said Foster. \u2018Jess was invited to take part in the same events and soundings are favourable from her. \u2018With heptathlon they might only battle it out twice a year but if sport in Britain is to benefit from the rivalry that is going to be inevitable between these two then they should compete against each other a couple more times head-to-head in one, two or three events. It\u2019s in their interests and very much in the sport\u2019s interest.\u2019 Both Johnson-Thompson and Ennis-Hill, 29, have the World Championships in Beijing this summer as their primary aim and will probably be joined by 17-year-old Lake, who has surpassed anything either of them achieved at the same age. Johnson-Thompson and Ennis-Hill are friends off the track despite the well speculated competition. Lord Coe and Ovett were great rivals in the 80s and provided huge entertainment for the athletics world. With 12 years spanning their ages the three are unlikely ever to stand on the podium together but Lord Coe thinks that they can transform the image of a sport that increasingly seems to command the spotlight only when a new doping scandal emerges. \u2018Those three can really help engage, particularly with young girls where the challenge is to get them involved in sport,\u2019 he said. \u2018Stars like Kat and Jess are important for the sport. They are from normal backgrounds, they haven\u2019t come out of some kind of super-schools, they are like the kids next door and that is really important so that people can identify with them.\u2019 The Morrisons Great Newham London Run takes place on Sunday, July 19 and gives you the chance to run on the track and cross the finish line in the Olympic Stadium. To take part, visit www.greatrun.org. 17-year-old Morgan Lake is highly regarded and could add serious competition to the title in the future.", "abstract": "The rivalry between Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Ennis-Hill has the potential to bring athletics into the spotlight, similar to the Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett clashes in the 1980s. Both Johnson-Thompson and Ennis-Hill are world-class heptathletes, and their head-to-head competitions could generate excitement for the sport. The pair are expected to compete against each other at the Hypo-Meeting in May, and there are plans to set up a head-to-head at the Great CityGames in Manchester."}
{"article": "I can remember so clearly visiting the hospital to see Kell Brook the day after that horrific knife attack in Tenerife. As soon as I walked in I looked into his eyes and I knew exactly what he was thinking - is it all over? The wound was horrific, some 38 staples virtually holding his thigh together. I couldn\u2019t believe it, only weeks before we had been celebrating the biggest moment of his career when he dethroned welterweight sensation Shawn Porter in his back yard to capture the IBF welterweight title. Suddenly we are sitting there waiting to find out if he would ever be able to enter a ring again. The doctor\u2019s analysis wasn\u2019t great - she said with the right rehab there was a decent chance he could fight again but he would not be able to perform in the same way in and out of the ring. She couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Kell Brook performs at a media workout ahead of the first defence of his world title against Jo Jo Dan. Brook at home shortly after he was stabbed (left) and showing his scar (right) on the week of his fight. Over the last few months Kell Brook has shown the heart of a lion. No one really gets to see the struggle he went through - dressing the wound, struggling to walk at first, the endless hours of rehab and massage and this is all before the camp got underway. What we have now, just days away from the first defence of his IBF welterweight title is an elite level fighter, someone who I believe can go on and unify the 147lb division and someone who is in devastating form, ready to make a statement to the world in front of his home fans. Saturday in Sheffield is going to be an emotional night. No one has taken Jo Jo Dan for granted - he has earned the right to challenge Kell as the No 1 and mandatory challenger - a position Kell was in not so long ago. He is confident and full of hope to become world champion but he has a wounded lion in front of him who is ready to bite. It will be an awkward fight. Jo Jo is a southpaw who comes on strong late in fights. Another challenge for Kell will be handling the emotions of the situation in front of 10,000 people. But I believe in Kell. I think he has to impose himself early and I suspect he\u2019ll produce a devastating performance with a stoppage somewhere in the middle rounds. We\u2019ll see. Dan has earned his shot at Brook after becoming the mandatory challenger for his IBF world title. There are some huge plans ahead for Kell Brook but for now it\u2019s all about Saturday. Live on Sky Sports and live on Showtime in the US - finally he gets his chance to get his big homecoming. It\u2019s going to be some night. Fight fans can tune into a packed bill from 7.30pm - Frankie Gavin makes his Matchroom debut against Bogdan Mitic ahead of his massive fight with Chris Van Heerden on May 9 in Birmingham and Gavin McDonnell continues his fairlytale career battling Ukraine\u2019s Alexander Yegorov for the vacant European title. Big-punching Sheffield middleweight Adam Etches could be in a fight of the year contender with Sergei Khomitsky, who dismantled London super-middleweight Frank Buglioni in his last visit to the UK. Kal Yafai, Charlie Edwards and Stephen Smith are also in action. Adam Etches (above) takes on Sergei Khomitsky in what promises to be an intriguing fight in Sheffield. Last week we announced a huge show for May 30 at the O2 in London. After his destruction of Daniel Estrada at the same venue earlier this Year, Kevin Mitchell will go toe to toe with three-weight world champion Jorge Linares. That fight, for the Venezuelan\u2019s WBC world lightweight title, is going to be an absolute cracker. It is a real 50-50 fight. It is going to be a huge night of boxing in the capital, a year after that massive occasion at Wembley. The Welsh Mayweather, Lee Selby, is fighting Evgeny Gradovich for the IBF featherweight title and that is another fight that could go either way. Lee is so talented. Kevin Mitchell (left) will challenge for Jorge Linares' world title when he takes on the WBC champion in May. Anthony Joshua is on the bill against Kevin Johnson, a loud American with some real talent. People ask me about AJ and how he is recovering after the stress fracture in his back. I watched him sparring in a three-hour session last week and he is looking devastating. I left that day feeling more convinced than ever that this guy is going to be the world heavyweight champion. He will fight first on April 4 in Newcastle and I will make an announcement on his opponent in the coming days. I will meet Barry McGuigan and Carl Frampton\u2019s team in London today as we work towards making", "abstract": "Kell Brook, the IBF welterweight champion, is set to defend his title against Jo Jo Dan on Saturday in Sheffield.

{"article": "From Twitter abuse to derogatory comments on Facebook and abusive posts on Reddit, online bullying is a growing problem. Now a new survey has revealed that unpleasant and hurtful behaviour is becoming increasingly common in real life as well. One woman who knows all too well how that feels is Harnaam Kaur, 23, from Slough in Berkshire who has been growing a beard since the age of 16. Scroll down for video. Standing up to bullies: Harnaam Kaur, 23, appeared on This Morning to talk about her experiences. Facial hair: Ms Kaur began growing a beard aged 16 after developing polycystic ovary syndrome. She is one of the millions of British adults who have been bullied at some point in their lives, with most targeted about their appearance. Ms Kaur, who is now an anti-bullying campaigner, appeared on ITV's This Morning which commissioned the survey to discuss her experiences. Her problems began after she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that causes excess hair growth. As a result, the teaching assistant endured years of cruel taunts about her looks and spent thousands of pounds desperately trying to get rid of her beard. But after converting to Sikhism, a religion that forbids cutting hair, she decided to embrace her looks and allowed her beard to grow. Targeted: Ms Kaur, a teaching assistant, was bullied after developing facial hair due to her PCOS. Brave: Since becoming a Sikh, she has embraced her facial hair and appeared in a photography exhibition. Hard: Ms Kaur initially spent thousands trying to get rid of her facial hair but has now embraced it. PCOS is a common condition affecting a woman's ovaries, with three main features. These are cysts developing in their ovaries, the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, and high levels of male hormones - 'androgens'. The syndrome is associated with irregular hormone levels in the body, including insulin. There is no cure for the condition, but medicine is available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth and fertility problems. Most women with the condition can get pregnant - but sometimes need a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling. This involves destroying tissue in the ovaries making androgens including testosterone. 'When I first started growing my beard it was for religious reasons but as the years have gone by I\u2019ve kept it for more personal reasons,' she said in an interview conducted after her photo was included in an exhibition celebrating the world's best facial hair. 'It makes me feel like a brave, confident woman who isn't afraid to break society\u2019s norms.' Sadly, Ms Kaur's experience of being bullied isn't unique. Women are slightly more likely to suffer abuse, with 55 per cent saying they had been bullied compared to 54 per cent of men. Nevertheless, both sexes suffered mental bullying such as unkind remarks, with 64 per cent of women claiming to have had to put up with cruel comments and 37 per cent of men. Male respondents were considerably more likely to have been subjected to physical attacks, with almost 20 per cent saying they had been beaten up by bullies. While small numbers reported being bullied because of their ethnicity or sexuality, the vast majority, 50.6 per cent, said they were bullied because of their looks. Speaking about the results, a spokesman for This Morning said: 'These numbers reflect the current bullying culture-situation among adults today. 'There are some  shocking results that our viewers have disclosed and on This Morning today we will go through these with guests who have suffered similar experiences. 'This Morning is a topical lifestyle programme and prides itself on covering every issue effecting its viewers and we hope all experiences and advice featured today will offer help and support to all currently being bullied.'", "abstract": "A new survey commissioned by ITV's This Morning has revealed that bullying is becoming increasingly common in real life, with 55% of women and 54% of men saying they have been bullied.

{"article": "Shaun Harrison, Sr, 55, was charged with allegedly shooting a student in the face 'execution style' A father-of-eight minister and former dean of students at a Boston high school was charged for allegedly shooting one of his students in the face 'execution-style'. The unnamed Boston English High School student survived and told police he had been selling marijuana for Shaun Harrison, Sr. for the past several months, according to Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Michael Bradley. Bradley said the student had been told by Harrison, 55,  that they were on their way to a house where the student could pick up marijuana and girls\u00a0on the night of the shooting. After Harrison's home was searched on Thursday police found an illegally-owned rifle and shotgun in his bedroom, which Bradley said the minister had told police were weapons he had inherited from his father. Harrison only began working at Boston English High School at the beginning of January and served as a 'community or family outreach coordinator,' school spokeswoman Denise Snyder told the Boston Globe. She said he was unofficially recognized as the 'Dean of Students'. Harrison's defense attorney Kernahan Buck said he also ran anger management and substance abuse programs at the high school. He has since been fired from the high school, according to interim school superintendent John McDonough. The Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Harrison was an ordained Baptist minister who left the church, of which he was a member, in 2012 to form his own non-denominational church. The father-of-eight is an ordained Baptist minister and was the 'dean of students' at Boston English High School. The student allegedly told police\u00a0he was selling marijuana for Harrison for the past several months. Rev. Opal Adams, an associate pastor at the church, told the Boston Globe that Harrison did anti-violence work with young people in the community. Harrison's sister Susan believes he was'setup'. 'My brother is a good man and I don't know how this happened,' she told the Boston Globe. Harrison's son Jeremy, an anti-violence activist who worked to keep kids off the street, was arrested after shooting his girlfriend in the head while cleaning his illegally-owned firearm in 2013. She was critically wounded, according to the Boston Herald. Harrison was charged on Thursday with assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery and unlawful possession of a firearm. His bail was set at $250,000 cash.

{"article": "Mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug E.coli  if they get splashed with mud, doctors warned today. Medics at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary say they treated a 23-year-old cyclist for an E.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. The man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables, nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. A man was treated for E. coli which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a Tough Mudder event and was splashed with infected mud (file picture) But eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet, muddy tracks in eastern Scotland. He, along with other competitors, had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight, and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race. It is thought this was how he became infected with the bug, which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry. The man said he had taken part in a 'Tough Mudder' event, which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools. The cyclist, who has not been identified, recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the Journal of Infection Prevention. Writing in the research paper, the doctors warned: 'Sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high-risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with E. coli 0157. 'This case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of E.coli 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events.' Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is usually 3-4 days, but it's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear (up to two weeks). Source: NHS Choices. Dr Robert Laing, consultant physician in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and co-author of the journal article, said: 'We know that E.coli 0157 survives well in cattle faeces. 'This case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. 'Splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible.' E.coli 0157, which lives in the gut of animals, is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. Scotland has a particularly high incidence of the strain, with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the UK. In 2012, three people contracted E.coli 0157 infection following a 12-mile 'Tough Mudder' event at Drumlanrig Castle, Dumfriesshire, which involved immersion or contact with mud. Also in 2012, a study of one of the world's largest mountain bike races, the 95k Birkebeinerrittet in Norway, which annually attracts 19,000 participants, found that when mudguards were attached to bikes, there were fewer cases of gastrointestinal illness. Health Protection Scotland warned anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling and  crossing areas that might contain animal faeces are at risk of picking up E.Coli (pictured in a petri dish) A Health Protection Scotland spokesman said today: 'Anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling\u00a0- and events that cross areas that have recently been occupied by animals such as cattle or sheep - should be aware of the risks of picking up a gastro-intestinal infection such as Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), more commonly referred to as E.coli. 'One of the main risks to humans is from coming into contact directly or indirectly with contaminated animal faeces. 'Our advice would be to follow common sense principles and if you have contaminated hands or face, take care that this material does not get into your mouth and wash as soon as possible and before eating.'", "abstract": "Doctors at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary have warned that mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk of contracting E.coli if they get splashed with mud.

{"article": "A group of California parents have filed a lawsuit against a daycare center accusing two instructors of pricking thumb tacks into the legs of their young children as a. form a discipline and threatening the toddlers to keep them quiet about the abuse. The civil suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday, says. the teachers involved in the abuse, which occurred between 2013. and 2014 at a Tutor Time franchise, were fired after their. actions came to the attention of management, but that the. daycare center concealed their actions from parents. The suit follows an investigation by state authorities who. cited the center in Agoura Hills, west of Los Angeles, after. finding at least one instructor 'used tactics to intimate and. scare children,' according to documents from the state. Department of Social Services. Four California mothers have filed a lawsuit against the Tutor Time daycare center in Agoura Hills, accusing instructors there of pricking their children's legs with pins as a way of discipline. The lawsuit filed on behalf of four parents, identified in court papers as Nicole Z., Kim M., Debbie S. and Krista L., says their 2- and 3-year-old children suffered cruel and unusual abuse in a recurring. practice known at the center as 'pica pica,' which translated. from Spanish means 'prick prick.' 'If a boy was deemed inattentive or failed to follow. directions, these teachers would stick a pin into the child's. legs,' said the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of the parents by personal injury attorney Robert Clayton. 'The push pin was pressed deep enough into the legs to. inflict pain and injury on the child,' the court papers read. The lawsuit accuses the two instructors, named as Rosa Nepomuseno and Jessica Morales, and the operators of. the center of negligence, failure to report abuse, assault and. battery, breach of contract and other wrongdoing and seeks an. unspecified amount in damages. Caseworkers from the state Department of Social Service visited the daycare center last May and uncovered evidence that serious violations had occurred there, reported 7Online. As a result of the investigation, three Tutor Time workers were fired, including one who knew about the abuse but failed to report it. A former worker told the station that the classroom for 2-year-olds was overcrowded, with two instructors having to look after about two dozen toddlers. The lawsuit alleges that the sister of one of the alleged victims was \u201cmade to watch the defendants inflict this brutal punishment on her twin brother, which resulted in severe mental and emotional injuries to her. In a phone interview with Daily Mail Wednesday, attorney Robert Clayton said the first plaintiff in the lawsuit found out about the alleged abuse a year ago from a terminated Tutor Time teacher, who told the woman about the push pins, not knowing that she had a son at the daycare center. The attorney said when he contacted the management at Tutor Time, \u2018they weren\u2019t denying it happened, but they didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u2019 The boys\u2019 families, however, were of a different opinion. Clayton said: \u2018They were shocked. They could not fathom this had happened to their children, especially in a place they trusted\u2026They made the parents feel very safe.\u2019 The lawyer representing the four mothers said whenever parents would notice scrapes and pokes on the toddlers\u2019 legs and mention it to instructors at Tutor Time, the standard response was, \u2018they\u2019re just boys.\u2019 But according to Clayton, the teachers named as defendants in the lawsuit threatened the children to keep quiet about the pin pricks. Painful punishment: The lawsuit alleges\u00a02- and 3-year-old children suffered cruel and unusual abuse in a recurring practice known at the center as 'pica pica,' which translated from Spanish means 'prick prick' Clayton claimed that whenever one of the instructors would see the toddlers approach other staffers at the daycare center, she would tap her pocket containing thumb pins to warn them not to say anything about the \u2018pica pica\u2019 ritual. The attorney said his clients\u2019 children have been receiving counselling to help them deal with nightmares and bed-wetting allegedly resulting from the trauma. \u2018They are frightened every time they see anything sharp,\u2019 the lawyer told Daily Mail. The law partner at the LA-based firm Taylor and Ring further said his clients want to see change. \u2018They want to see that this never happens to another child,\u2019 said Clayton. Clayton said he has been getting calls from other parents, suggesting that there could be more victims out there. Lydia Cisaruk, a spokeswoman for Tutor Time, told Reuters in an. email that the company acquired the center from its franchise. operator last August but the purchase was unrelated to the. allegations of abuse. 'Before the acquisition, this matter was addressed by the. franchise owner/operator in conjunction with the licensing. authorities", "abstract": "Four California mothers have filed a lawsuit against a Tutor Time daycare center in Agoura Hills, accusing instructors there of pricking their children's legs with pins as a way of discipline.

{"article": "(CNN)With the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager Tony Robinson in Madison, Wisconsin, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, it's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point. And the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve. To approach things from a more positive angle, the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative. The best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse. This unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems, which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them. When things are going wrong, responsible people can begin by saying the right things. President Obama said on Twitter, \"Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together.\" The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying, \"The CBC understands the frustrations in Ferguson, but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country.\" And Attorney General Eric Holder noted, \"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson.... This was a damn punk, a punk who was trying to sow discord.\" For the most part, authorities in Missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters. Surely, not all responses have been as measured, but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people. While we pause for a moment to let passions cool, we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination. The way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community's real concerns. And it's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces. This approach would benefit both the community and the police. I'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations, as noted in the DOJ report on Ferguson. Nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent. One of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats. Officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass. Being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them. The cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies, he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve. Another idea is to give cops bicycles, which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community. Lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the DOJ report on Ferguson. In areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide, mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together. After all, both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods. Both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level.  A tech services company in the South Bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood. The event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like \"basically they're like us.\" Ultimately, police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike. Communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations. New Orleans Police Det. Winston Harbin became a minor Internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during Mardi Gras. Besides just being fun, Harbin's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing. Fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism, unequal treatment, bias, subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity. It is times like now, when that anger and resentment are boiling, that we address it. With the right approach, we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from \"HandsUpDon'tShoot\" to \"HandsTogetherInTrust.\"", "abstract": "The strained race relations in the US are being pushed to the breaking point with the ongoing protests over the shooting death of black teenager Tony Robinson, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and the shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri.

{"article": "Mark Noble is refusing to give up on his dream of breaking into the England squad ahead of the European Championship Finals despite being overlooked once again by Roy Hodgson. Noble has been one of the star performers since West Ham gained promotion back into the Premier League back in 2012. The 27-year-old has represented England at every level from the Under 16s to the Under 19s and was even made captain of the Under 21s team for the Euro Finals in 2009. But he has somehow failed to catch the attention of Hodgson who even called up Tottenham's inexperienced midfielder Ryan Mason ahead of him for the forthcoming games against Lithuania and Italy when Adam Lallana was forced to pull out of the squad with a groin injury. Mark Noble (right), Winston Reid (centre) and Diafra Sakho pose outside West Ham's future home. The Hammers will be moving to the Olympic Stadium in London next summer. However, Noble says he will not sulk over the matter and will continue to show his best form for West Ham as he looks to help the club push for a European place as they prepare to move into the Olympic Stadium next summer. Noble said: \u2018I have made it clear what I think about the situation and I would love to play for my country. But obviously at the moment it doesn't look like it is going to happen. \u2018I will keep playing as well as I can at West Ham and enjoying it every week. You never know what will happen in the future. Roy Hodgson takes charge of England training, having overlooked Noble for the squad yet again. Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason (second left) was a late call up in the position played by Noble. \u2018When we move to the Olympic Stadium we have to be thinking about European football because of the gate receipts and the money coming into the club and hopefully we will be able to invest in better players. We invested really well last summer and that has shown this season.\u2019 Noble hopes he will given a better chance of an England call-up following the proposals by FA chairman Greg Dyke this week to limit the number of non-EU players playing in this country. Harry Kane has come through the Tottenham youth system and only made a name for himself in the top flight back in November, but has already been rewarded for his outstanding season with his first call-up into the England squad this week. Noble has been one of the standout performers since West Ham returned to the top flight in 2012. The 27-year-old has represented England at every age level from the Under 16s to Under 21s. Noble feels a number of other home-grown players could now follow Kane into the senior squad if they are given the chance to play on a regular basis. When asked about Dyke's proposals, Noble added: \u2018I think that is great. When I came through into the league I was played at 17. You don't get that a lot now with players coming through the academies. \u2019If you do that you have to be very special because of the foreign players coming in. We have got the best league in the world and we want to keep it like that, but it will be nice to see some of our homegrown boys given a chance.\u2019 Lycamobile supports the West Ham Foundation as part of its mission to bring communities together. www.lycamobile.com.", "abstract": "Mark Noble, the West Ham midfielder, has not given up on his dream of playing for England in the European Championship Finals, despite being overlooked by Roy Hodgson.

Authorities in Minneapolis are now searching the river for Jennifer Houle's body. They are not declaring the case a suicide as her body has not yet been recovered, and any cause of death would be released by the Hennepin County medical examiner, they said. But police said a video shows Houle alone on the 10th Avenue bridge before she entered the water in the early hours on Friday and no suspects are being sought in connection with the incident. Scroll down for video. Loss: Jennifer Houle (pictured left, and left with a friend) went missing after a night out on Thursday but police have now said she entered the water from a nearby bridge in the early hours of Friday. Teams of rescuers searched the Mississippi river in an effort to recover Jennifer Houle's body from the water.

'That kind of set off some emotions,' Laven told KSTP. She said she had become separated from Houle in the bar and was unable to find her. Laven said that Houle's purse and phone were found in the street near her apartment just a few blocks from the bar at 3am on Friday, suggesting she had tried to walk home.

{"article": "Arsenal are searching for a fourth consecutive Premier League win at Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night as they look to chase down second-placed Manchester City. With a nine-point gap to leaders Chelsea, the title looks to be beyond Arsene Wenger's men yet again despite their recent good form. But would finishing as runners-up to Jose Mourinho's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name? Arsenal fan Lee Hurley of blog\u00a0Daily Cannon tells us whether coming second would be a success for the Gunners. Just four points from second place, Arsenal haven\u2019t finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil-rich Manchester City comes after the Emirates-austerity period has ended. But while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans, it can\u2019t be the end of Arsenal\u2019s ambitions and it won\u2019t be seen as success in its own right. This is a club that wins titles, 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when Chelsea decided to start buying trophies as they couldn\u2019t win them any other way. Arsenal players look dejected during the Monaco defeat as they now face a daunting second leg comeback. Arsene Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated in a 3-1 defeat by Monaco. Alexis Sanchez has been a star performer for the Gunners this season as they seek a top-two finish. In a league that contains clubs who have been outspending Arsenal significantly, to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted Arsenal, again, at the start of this season, who knows how much closer to Chelsea they might have been. But that\u2019s how it\u2019s been with Arsenal over the past 10 years \u2013 a severe case of the \u2018might have beens\u2019 \u2013 what might have been had they not lost so many top players to City and Barcelona and United, or if Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny not been monumental idiots in the League Cup final, or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the Emirates or Eduardo\u2019s leg not been snapped in 2008 when Arsenal were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same, albeit in a less dramatic fashion. Or, or, or.... If I\u2019m honest, it's all got a little tedious for many fans, which is why the FA Cup success last season was celebrated so wildly \u2013 a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts. The departures of Thierry Henry (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) to Barcelona in the past were huge blows. Arsenal players Mathieu Flamini (left), Olivier Giroud (middle) and Aaron Ramsey (right) celebrate FA Cup success in May 2014 - the club's ended a nine-year trophy drought. Wenger has come under a barrage of criticism from Arsenal fans after last Wednesday's  defeat to Monaco. I can\u2019t speak for all Arsenal fans. Such is the divide between Gooners, nobody could do that (so don\u2019t trust anyone who claims they do). For some fans nothing short of a trophy every year would represent success to them, regardless of how stupid that expectation is. For others they recognise how hard it is to just get in the top four every year (don\u2019t believe me, ask Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester United, even Chelsea who dropped out for a season) and how the footballing landscape has changed so dramatically over the past decade. Ultimately, football is about what you can celebrate and while it\u2019s great fun to get into the Champions League every year, at least until the group stages are over, it\u2019s just not the same as watching your captain lift aloft that great big trophy. After years of scrapping fourth, I\u2019d be more than content should Arsenal grab second place. I want more, though, and I think that is the one and only thing that unites Arsenal fans \u2013 they all want more. How patient we all plan to be for it to arrive is another matter altogether.

New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. '(Life\u2019s) changed a lot. The first five years I didn\u2019t do much with my life. It was pretty much spent inside the prison. I pretty much woke up every morning, I did some sport, I ate, I waited (until) lockdown. I woke up the next day and repeated again,' news.com.au reported him as saying. 'Then occasionally I\u2019d have somebody visit me. I pretty much did that for five years,' Sukumaran says. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' Sukumaran said. The Australian said that in the past ten years, the only thing that has consistently brought him joy has been helping others, and that being productive was his only real choice in order to avoid being 'destructive'. The release of the very candid interview comes as a painting of the Indonesian President Joko Widodo was revealed, inscribed with the message 'People Can Change'. Sukumaran painted the oil on canvas portrait of Mr Widodo in January after hearing that his bid for clemency was rejected. The Australian has recently completed his Fine Arts degree through Curtin University and has used his art as therapy for himself and other prisoners. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop spoke about the impending execution of Sukumaran and fellow Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan on ABC's Q&A program on Monday night. 'I'm not going to give up hope while they are still alive,' Ms Bishop said. 'I will continue to make representations as we are across Government, at every level across all the Indonesian departments, and the Indonesian ministers, the Australian Government\u2019s counterparts, we will continue to do that, and we are joined by other nations whose citizens are also facing death by firing squad, and we are working very hard, leaving no stone unturned, in our efforts to ensure that we can seek a permanent stay of execution for them' A painting by Sukumaran of the Indonesian President Joko Widodo was revealed. Sukumaran painted the portrait of Mr Widodo after hearing that his bid for clemency was rejected. The original painting was inscribed with the message 'People Can Change' Ms Bishop said that she could find no good purpose that could be served by the execution of the two Australians, especially considering the strides they had made to improving the lives of fellow prisoners. She pointed to the work the pair had been involved in, including the education and encouragement they provided to others in the jail. 'They are involved in the rehabilitation of other prisoners. Andrew Chan is now a Pastor. He has got a theology degree. He is providing a spiritual nourishment to other prisoners,' Ms Bishop said. 'Myuran Sukumaran is now an accomplished artist and he is taking art classes, master classes in art, and I just think that it would be a terrible injustice if these men were to pay for their crimes with their lives.'

A Brutally honest letter written by Roald Dahl to a teenager who asked him for advice on his A-level project has surfaced. Budding writer Jay Williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written. The 17-year-old did not expect a reply. But Mr Williams, who grew up near Carlisle, was delighted when he received a typed note signed by the man himself. However, in true Dahl style, there was a sting in the tail. However the letter was not what the eager teenager had expected with Dahl heavily criticising his use of 'beastly adjectives'. The correspondence read: 'Dear Jay, You are asking too much of me. You must realise I get an awful lot of these letters and you can't expect me to write your thesis for you. 'It should be fairly obvious to you what the role of a short story is in modern literature. It's a big one. 'Study particularly the American short story writers like O'Henry and Runyon and Hawthorne and Poe, and lots and lots of English ones. 'If you want any dope on me there have been an awful lot of profiles in English magazines over the past year starting with the February 1979 edition of Vogue. 'I have read your story. I don't think it's bad, but you must stop using too many adjectives. Roald Dahl responded saying the teenager was 'asking too much,' but that said that he had read his story. 'Study Hemingway, particularly his early work and learn how to write short sentences and how to eschew all those beastly adjectives. 'Surely it is better to say 'She was a tall girl with a bosom' than 'She was a tall girl with a shapely, prominent bosom', or some such rubbish. The first one says it all.' Jay, who now lives in Bristol, recently found the letter while going through old boxes and posted a picture on Twitter. The image was posted alongside the caption: 'In 1980, as a spotty teenager, I wrote to Roald Dahl asking for advice on writing. Here is his priceless response.' Amazingly it has now been re-tweeted more than 1,700 times and has been favourited by almost 2,400 people. Jay, who set up PR company 72point, said: 'As a callow youth, I was expecting him to tell me how marvellous the story was, and offer to introduce me to his publisher. Mr Williams in his teens, left, and the celebrated  author Roald Dahl, right, who replied to his letter. 'Instead he gave me this fairly forthright criticism. 'The story was for an A-Level English Literature project, and was probably really self-indulgent, overflowing with flowery adjectives, which Dahl quite rightly bristled at. 'After considering his advice, I have to admit it was probably fair and I've taken heed of it ever since. 'I was a big fan of Dahl's short stories aimed at adults, like Kiss Kiss. I loved their dark elements, the twist in the tale.

The fall occurs right as the doors are closing the the train is preparing to leave the station. Unsteady: This is the moment the apparently intoxicated man (left) loses his balances and goes to fall into the cap between the two carriages. Fall: The video shows the passenger falling straight into the space between the connected carriages. Down: The man slips straight into the gap, as fellow passengers (right) watch on with shock. As the man falls, shocked onlookers try to help, only to realize the train is alighting. One man can be seen in the video panicking and holding his hands in the air. However, one the train passes and people scurry to the platform's edge, believing a tragedy has just occurred, they suddenly see the man get to his feet and continue stumbling. He somehow fell into the zone outside of the rails known as the 'area of refuge'. The fellow passengers quickly pull the man up to the platform. Police arrived to assist the man. He suffered only minor injuries from the fall. Safe: People on the platform can be seen pulling the man back up onto the station after the train departs.

Sahray Barber, whose March 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across Southern California's Inland Empire, resurfaced on March 19. She had spent the ten days living in two Los Angeles-area hospitals under assumed names. Scroll down for video. Sahray Barber vanished on March 9 from her home in San Bernadino, California, and a search effort began. The 22-year-old college student reappeared on March 19 after spending about ten days in LA hospitals. After leaving the second hospital, she met a woman who treated her kindly and finally got her to open up and to reach out to her father, Barber said. Barber called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home. While she was gone, a huge search involving aircraft, dogs and horseback riders was being carried out by police. Barber released a statement to the\u00a0Riverside Press-Enterprise Enterprise on Thursday trying to explain what happened to her. She said she had lost her job, her car had been wrecked and computer problems were causing her to fall behind in her studies at the Art Institute of California-Inland Empire. She wrote: 'Things got so bad that I didn't know what to say or who to ask for help,. 'I had dug a hole so deep, that I felt entirely hopeless.' She called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home. Barber indicated that she paid little attention to media reports of the search while she was in the hospital, but was stunned when she found out all it involved. The young woman called what she did 'incredibly dumb'. She wrote: 'I ask for everyone's forgiveness, most especially my wonderful family for all the worry and long nights I caused you, and all the amazing men, women, dogs and horses that searched for me.' On the day she vanished, Barber walked out of her apartment, threw her computer and a few other belongings over a wall and left with just a few dollars in her pocket. Her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of California State University, San Bernardino, near Barber's home. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against Barber's roommates. They gave statements to police that indicated Barber had been killed, according to\u00a0Burguan.

{"article": "The last the world knew of Pia\u00a0Farrenkopf, she had withdrawn $1,500 from her checking account in\u00a0February 25, 2009. Friends and family didn't see or hear from the woman they described as fun and intelligent in the years since, but they chalked it up to Farrenkopf's solitary tendencies. Meanwhile, letters piled up in her mailbox in the middle-class neighborhood where she lived in Pontiac, Michigan, before being taken back to the Post Office as unclaimed. Mummified: Pia Farrenkopf, who was 44 when authorities believe she died, sat for five years in the backseat of her car mummified. A family member even tried to phone in 2012 to tell Farrenkopf her mother had died, but never got a response. Mortgage payments kept being deducted automatically from bank accounts flush with cash from Farrenkopf's job at ALLTEL Information Services, where she had once programmed banking software. It was not until the money ran out in 2013 and the bank foreclosed that Farrenkopf was finally discovered. The\u00a0Detroit Free Press\u00a0reports two repairmen, hired to patch a hole in the roof, found her in 2014, slumped in the backseat of the Jeep Liberty parked in her garage, mummified. Investigators later noted she was found surrounded by hundreds of unopened letters and several empty packs of cigarettes. She had $500 in cash in her pockets and a partially drank bottle of wine by her side. Detectives couldn't find a single fingerprint on the bottle. The home was in a state of chaos and disrepair - a far cry from the way her friend Joan Gill Strack said Farrenkopf liked to keep her home. Scene: Neighbors said they helped clear the driveway and mow the lawn while they believed Farrenkopf was still in the home, though many eventually moved away. World traveler: Farrenkopf traveled to England and Scotland, as well as around the United States, while working programming banking software for ALLTEL Information Services. 'Her house was well-kept, very clean, very tidy,' Strack said. 'She liked things picked up and ordered.' But police found the floors littered with empty soda bottles, more unopened mail, loose clothing and refuse.\u00a0Black mold had invaded after the sump pump broke down, with dark spots dotting the walls. Strack, who had worked with Farrenkopf when the two lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, said she was 'fun to be around' and'very, very good at her job,' and traveled to Scotland and England and throughout the US for work. Still, Farrenkopf was never extremely social. Siblings recalled long stretches of time where they wouldn't hear from Farrenkopf, who would often not  return phone calls. Fun and smart: Farrenkopf, pictured in this undated photo taken at a coworker's birthday celebration, was described as an excellent employee. Mysterious: Darryl Tillery, a neighbor, said he could not have known that the solitary Farrenkopf was in her garage for five years. Then a postcard or call came from a far-flung destination like Austria. 'Sometimes she would go, literally, for years without us hearing from her,' one sister, Jean LeBlanc, who lives in the Boston area near where Pia and her nine siblings grew up, told the Free Press. 'And then all of a sudden, she'd show up, so nobody ever thought anything about it.' Strack remembers how easily Farrenkopf could cut people out of her life when, after a friend showed up a few hours late for a party without calling, she immediately ended the relationship. 'Pia told her she was done with her,' Strack said. 'She didn't speak to her after that.' Strack said her own friendship with Farrenkopf ended in 2001, though she could provide few details beyond saying that they were together too much. Yet Farrenkopf was by all accounts still doing well. She continued working at Pontiac Fidelity National Information Services, where she was an 'exemplary employee,' management told the Free Press. She even began planning to open a small business of her own - a fitness business in nearby Waterford called Slender Lady. LeBlanc, who managed a Curves location in Massachusetts, agreed to travel to Texas with her sister in 2003, where the two attended a two-week seminar on health in preparation for Farrenkopf opening her business.

{"article": "A virus that starts off like the common cold could be responsible for leaving more than 100 children with paralysis. Last summer, more than 1,000 children and teens across the country were hospitalized with symptoms that appeared to be caused by a particularly nasty strain of enterovirus. While some of the children showed only minor symptoms of the virus - such as runny nose, sneezing and coughing - others suffered weakness of the limbs to complete paralysis. Doctors caring for the sick children  connected the illness early on to a pathogen called enterovirus  D-68. A new study published on Monday has strengthened the connection between enterovirus D68 and the sudden paralysis of more than 100 children in the last year. A new study published Monday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases backed those initial opinions, after following the progress of 25 children in California and Colorado who experienced paralysis. Enteroviruses are a type of virus that use a single strand of RNA to replicate themselves inside the cells of mammals. Among other enteroviruses are polio, the virus that causes Hand Foot and Mouth disease along with others that cause a range of respiratory illnesses. Enterovirus D-68 is among the most recently idenfitied and was first spotted in California in 1962. It can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and is likely to be spread by inhaling virus particles when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface. In previous years only small numbers of EV-D68 infections have been reported but that has increased during 2014, according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. It has caused severe illness in a number of children and has even been implicated in some deaths. The incidence of infections has fallen off considerably since October but public health officials warn that infections seem to spike during the late summer and autumn. Researchers now suggest that the children were infected with a mutated form of D-68, which first appeared four years ago. B1 has five to six coding differences that make it different from other strains commonly found in the U.S., and that these differences cause nerve-damaging symptoms similar to polio. And like polio, the nerve damage appears to be permanent - since none of the children have fully recovered. 'This is starting to look more like polio unfortunately where the paralysis appears to be permanent or semi-permanent. This is why there is such an urgency for more research to investigate this' researcher Charles Chiu, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said according to the Washington Post. However, the study has not definitely proved the connection between B1 and the paralyzed children, since researchers could not find the strain in the patients' spinal fluid. The researchers however, theorized that that was because the samples were taken too late. 'This is a virus that causes the common cold,' Chiu told NBC News. 'Parents don't bring their kids in until they are really sick. By that time, typically, the viral levels may be very, very low or undetectable.' They looked for other viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites that also could have caused the symptoms but none were present. Researchers were also not able to answer another mystery of the enterovirus - why some children only came down with minor symptoms and others lasting paralysis. Included in the study were two siblings that both came down with an 100 per cent genetically-identical strain of the virus in the past year. One of the siblings experienced  paralysis while the other only suffered upper respiratory symptoms. With enterovirus season just a few months away in late summer, researchers are saying it's extremely important that more work be done to unravel the B1 mystery and make grounds to develop a vaccine to fight the dangerous virus. The Children's Hospital Colorado continues to monitor the patients infected with enterovirus, and have even set up a special clinic for the victims.", "abstract": "A new study has strengthened the connection between enterovirus D68 and the sudden paralysis of more than 100 children in the last year.

Theresa May is being lined up to become Foreign Secretary, tasked with clawing back powers from Brussels, it emerged today. David Cameron is said to be considering promoting the Home Secretary to lead the fight to overhaul Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. The Prime Minister has made clear that if he is returned to Downing Street after the election he wants talks on EU reform to begin immediately. The Tories are going into the election campaign as the only party promising to renegotiate EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has visited almost every European capital in a bid to build support for his call for reform. Now it has emerged that the Prime Minister is considering handing the plumb job to Mrs May, according to the Independent on Sunday. She would be seen as 'Britain\u2019s answer to Angela Merkel', government sources say. Mr Cameron yesterday hailed Mrs May as a 'brilliant' Home Secretary who had cut crime and 'told Abu Hamza to sling his hook'. Foreign Office insiders insist there is growing support for the reforms called for by Mr Cameron. It includes curbing access to benefits for migrants, ending child benefit being exported to families overseas and tighter controls on families coming to Britain. Close ties with Mrs Merkel are seen as vital. 'Five years ago you could get a senior official to go to Paris or Washington but not Berlin,' a senior source told MailOnline. 'But now the relationship with Germany is on a more formal footing, and Merkel had made clear she wants us to stay.' However, securing agreement on a referendum after the election could prove difficult. Colleagues: PM David Cameron (left) hailed Mrs May (right) as a 'brilliant' Home Secretary who had cut crime. Lib Dems leader Nick Clegg accused the Tories of dancing a 'hokey cokey where one day they want to leave, the next day they don't want to leave'. Speaking at his campaign launch in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, he said: 'We are unambiguous as a party that says \"yes, Europe needs to be reformed, yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the European Union, we guaranteed that in law\". Many trips: Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has visited almost every European capital in a bid to build support for his call for EU reform. 'We are not like the Conservative Party, half of whom are straining at the leash to leave. We think that would be a terrible thing for the British economy.' He added: 'Of course it would be an economic act of self harm to leave the European Union. 'Large parts of the Conservative Party and Ukip appear to want Britain to cut itself off from what is the world's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for British goods and services. 'For me it's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure Britain's presence at the heart of the European Union in the same way it's flaming obvious that we should secure the British economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts, which is the Conservative approach, nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing, which is Labour's approach.'", "abstract": "UK Home Secretary Theresa May is being considered for the role of Foreign Secretary, with the task of clawing back powers from Brussels.

Christine Roberts, from Telford, Shropshire, began comforting eating after her parents split up and her mother announced that she was a lesbian. Weighing 19 stone at her heaviest, Miss Roberts was bullied because of her mother Sue\u2019s sexuality. Scroll down for video. Christine Roberts used to be a size 26 but shed half her body weight and is now a svelte 10 stone. Christine's weight shot up to over 19 stone and she wore size 26 clothes. 'Kids at school said I was gay because she was,' said 23-year-old Miss Roberts, who is now eight stone lighter. 'I knew it wasn\u2019t her fault, it\u2019s just how she was. They would cyber-bully me using a fake profile of me to tell other girls from school that I was in love with them. It was really hard.' The bullying caused Miss Roberts to reach for the biscuits and by age 16, she was size 26. Aged six, Miss Roberts\u2019 parents split and her and her sister, Lisa, \u00a0who is now 20, stayed with their mother, now 54. However, the Marks and Spencer supervisor said back then she did not understand what had happened. She said: 'We went and stayed with mum\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 then. But it was actually her girlfriend. 'It wasn\u2019t until I was ten that I fully understood what was happening.' When children at school discovered her mother was a lesbian, Miss Roberts said bullies used it to pick on her and she found comfort in food. 'I\u2019d eat three packets of biscuits in one go while I was doing my coursework - I just couldn\u2019t stop,' said the 23-year-old.

'At home I\u2019d have huge portions at dinner and make out I hadn\u2019t eaten all day.' By the time she was 16, Miss Roberts weighed more than 19 stone. 'It was a non-stop cycle. I\u2019d eat because I was miserable, then feel guilty and eat more to try to feel better.' Miss Roberts would eat several packets of biscuits a day and regularly have takeaways with friends. She said: 'We\u2019d get a Chinese or have a greasy pizza together. 'But they weren\u2019t getting fat because they would only have two slices. 'I ate half the pizza by myself.' When Miss Roberts turned 18, she became even more self conscious. 'I\u2019d organise nights out with friends then cancel because I felt so uncomfortable,' she said. 'On the rare times I did go out, I felt like I was getting funny looks. 'I wouldn\u2019t go to the bar on my own. 'I\u2019d just sit down all night.

'I\u2019d seen it online while looking for different diets - people said the results were so quick,' she said. For the first ten days, Miss Roberts ate nothing but protein. She had two poached eggs for breakfast, Quorn chicken fillets for lunch and chicken breast with egg white for dinner. She said: 'I lost 13lbs in that first week and it felt amazing.' During the second phase, she could also eat non-starchy vegetables on alternate days. Christine said she is hoping that now she has lost weight, she will find true love. Christine said losing weight has made her feel confident about herself.

But an American filmmaker has created a three-minute video that presents Paris in an entirely unique way. Sean Collins, a 31-year-old from Los Angeles, used special effects to make the French capital's famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tour and Arc de Triomphe, and pedestrians look like miniature toys. The video is the work of photographer Sean Collins, who studied at the American School of Paris. The American video maker captures a shot of the Eiffel Tower in the distance of his unique film. Sean filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend, a Boston University student who is studying in Paris. He said: \u2018When I went to visit her we decided to make this video. On her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film. \u2018We couldn't film on rainy, cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times.\u2019 Sean, who was educated at The American School of Paris, but later studied at a film school in California, explained that his intention was to present the French capital in a way it has never been seen before. Sean Collins experimented with effects that make Paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets. The people captured underneath the Eiffel Tower in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines. He said: \u2018My goal was to show Paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites.\u2019 The video opens on a landscape shot of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and Army Museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together. The Champ de Mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it, appearing to look like figurines. Sean spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images. A train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child. Shots of boats travelling under bridges tie Paris' natural beauty with its urban iconography. A couple of timelapse shots of the Eiffel Tower continue this theme before a train, which looks like it could be being controlled by a child, travels across a bridge. More landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football. As darkness descends on the Parisian streets the landscapes become more beautiful, before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell. Sean recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in Paris. The Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups shots of people looking like toys. A distant shot of the Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups of people negotiating busy streets.

Discussing the difficulties faced while filming, Sean explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation. Sean's goal was to show Paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it. Sean had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality. \u2018It's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect. I spent two weeks testing different ways to change the \"texture\" of the image,\u2019 he said. \u2018I experimented with some really distorted toy-like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect.

Michael Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in Meribel in the French Alps\u00a0in December 2013. He was retired from F1 at the time of the accident. Van Amersfoort Racing propelled Max Verstappen - son of Schumacher snr's 1994 Benetton F1 team-mate Jos - to prominence in Formula 3 last season. Verstappen jnr, 17, will race for Toro Rosso in F1 in the 2015 season. 'In the last couple of years, it has become a tradition for us that we offer the runner-up from the German junior karting championship a test session in our simulator,' added Van Amesfoort. 'This is handled by the DMSB, the German motorsport authority, and that is how we first got in touch with Mick Schumacher last autumn. He spent a full day in the simulator at our headquarters in the Netherlands, then we witnessed him during a test session at Valencia and, eventually, we reached an agreement to compete together in this year's ADAC Formula 4 series.'

{"article": "Special bond: Gunner Amy Stevens and Highfield (H.P), who is retiring. The poignant message on a tombstone outside the HQ of The King\u2019s Troop at Woolwich Army barracks says it all: \u2018Here lies an old horse called Wonder, his extraordinary age being forty years old when he died. This stone was placed August 1, 1808.\u2019 Of course, that was back in the days when horses really went to war. One can only imagine the battles Wonder courageously survived. But the fact that Wonder lived to such a ripe old age \u2014 in human years, well over 100 \u2014 is testament to the fact that even when horses were used on battlefields, the British Army valued and looked after them. Today, the four-legged members of The King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery housed at Woolwich don\u2019t have to charge at the enemy, thank goodness. They perform only ceremonial duties, such as Trooping The Colour, state funerals and military tattoos. The worst they have to cope with is galloping through theatrical smoke at the Horse Of The Year show. What\u2019s more, they live in a luxurious state-of-the-art equestrian training facility, with an army of grooms tending to their every need. They enjoy 24-hour care, with a dedicated vet and farrier on site. They are exercised daily in the arena or hacked out in nearby Charlton Park. Once a year they go on a four-week summer holiday to Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, where they spend time out at grass. And yet, despite this, animal rights activists launched a withering attack on the MoD last month, accusing the Army of being cruel to horses. Campaigners from Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) claimed the military should not be allowed to keep any animals at all. They seized on figures showing the MoD had put down 109 of their horses in the past six years as evidence of neglect. Anyone with experience of horses \u2014 like me \u2014 will tell you that figure is actually quite modest considering the MoD has 500 horses in its care at any one time at Woolwich, where The King\u2019s Troop is stationed, and at Knightsbridge, where the Household Cavalry is based. Activists singled out figures showing that horses were put down because they fell lame or suffered from colic. They suggested the MoD did not try hard enough to re-home horses who could no longer work. Again, any horse owner will know that colic and leg injuries in equines are all too often serious enough to warrant euthanasia and that it is sometimes the only option. However, this didn\u2019t stop the activists. Mimi Bekhechi, director of Peta, complained: \u2018The Ministry of Defence has no business using horses, dogs or any other animals. They are not soldiers, nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service. \u2018While painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals, a combat zone is no place for them.\u2019 But no horses are used in combat now. What the animal rights lobby appear to be campaigning for, therefore, is an end to the role of horses at official events. This is a worrying development. The artillery fire a 41 Gun Royal Salute in Green Park in honour of Her Majesty The Queen's 87th birthday. They perform only ceremonial duties, such as Trooping The Colour, state funerals and military tattoos. For anyone who feels proud to watch the magnificent spectacle of our gleaming military horses on parade at Buckingham Palace or on The Mall, it seems unthinkable. What\u2019s more, anyone who visits the Woolwich base can see that they are incredibly well cared for. By any standards, The King\u2019s Troop headquarters is an amazing facility. Everywhere you look, soldiers are sweeping, scrubbing and polishing. The horses are in peak condition. Their coats are glossy, manes neatly trimmed. If they actually bothered to visit, the naysayers would see that the horses look as happy as can be. As he shows me round the stable blocks, Captain Nick Watson explains that the soldiers become incredibly attached to the animals in their care. They put years of painstaking work into training them. Almost all are bought as four-year-olds, mostly from Ireland, and stay in service until 18. Every effort is then made to find them civilian homes where they can kick up their heels. But military chiefs readily admit it can be tricky finding the right home. It is not just a simple case of turning them loose in a field or handing them over to the first person who comes through the door. These are working animals who are used to an interesting and varied life. On parade, the unit\u2019s soldiers drive a team of six of the horses with each pulling World War I field gun.

{"article": "(CNN)Kids, being kids, like to climb on things. More often than not, that's OK. But when the thing in question is a war memorial? That's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington. The photographer, Matt Munson, described the shot on Facebook as \"two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran.\" The parents, he said, were laughing. \"It actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before I could take a picture of them all,\" Munson wrote. \"The more I look at this photo the angrier I get.\" He has plenty of company there. As the photo went viral, comment after comment poured in on Facebook and Twitter, chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue, part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier. One nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet. The third looks skyward, to a rescue helicopter or perhaps God, according to the memorial foundation's website. In Munson's photo, a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair. The older man, wearing a Navy ballcap, and a woman also look on. The children's parents aren't shown. Disgusting. \"Disgusting,\" Facebook user Trisha Davidson wrote of the children's actions. \"So wrong,\" Twitter user karsonwithak chimed in. But not everyone was upset. \"I fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that,\" Reddit user z3k3 wrote. But the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of World War II \"loved watching the kids play on the local memorial.\" \"He saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little,\" z3k3 wrote. Fair enough, some said. But some memorials are meant to be interactive. Others aren't. And a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just doesn't seem to be the place for play, a Reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote. \"Unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly 'use me, interact with me, to help carry my message' (e.g. memorial benches), the default is leave it respectfully alone,\" nickfree wrote. On the Mommyish parenting blog, associate editor Maria Guido wrote that \"there's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some.\" \"If these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- I wouldn't find anything wrong with the image, actually. But they're not,\" she wrote. \"These parents were disrespectful,\" she wrote. \"The kids were being kids and following their directives.\" Though the National Parks Service, which operates the memorial, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect. \"Please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation's veterans,\" the group wrote on Facebook. \"We hope our visitors understand this moving forward.\"", "abstract": "An amateur photographer took a picture of two children climbing on top of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington, which has sparked outrage on social media.

{"article": "Waking up one morning, Leesa Barrell was alarmed to find that everything seemed very different. \u2018It felt like somebody had put a brick wall up against my right side,\u2019 she says. \u2018I called out to my husband Lee and when he replied I could only hear his voice in my left ear.\u2019 Leesa Barrell (pictured) woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear. Initially, Leesa, 45, who lives in Norwich with Lee, 49, a school caretaker, and their son Ashlee, 12, thought the problem was probably caused by a wax blockage and would correct itself within a few days. But when it didn\u2019t, a week after her first symptoms she went to see her GP and was referred to an ear, nose and throat consultant. The specialist dropped a bombshell \u2014 she had lost the hearing in her right ear, possibly for good. \u2018At that point I became very tearful. I was so worried my hearing would never return,\u2019 she says. Leesa, a finance assistant, was even more overwhelmed when doctors could not explain why it had happened. Leesa is one of up to 6,000 adults a year estimated to develop idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, or unexplained hearing loss, that usually develops suddenly, or within three days, usually in one ear. Often, sudden hearing loss can be attributed to infections, certain medications, head injuries and meningitis, because these can all affect the inner ear. But in some cases, such as Leesa\u2019s, there is no clear explanation. The hearing organ, the cochlea, is found deep in the inner ear. It is filled with fluid \u2014 when soundwaves enter it, the fluid moves and tiny hair cells then trigger signals to the auditory nerve, which passes the signals to the brain. These are recognised as sounds, allowing us to hear. Sensorineural hearing loss is down to problems in the inner ear or with the auditory nerve. The other type \u2014 conductive hearing loss \u2014 occurs when something has physically blocked transmissions of sound, such as wax. \u2018Eighty-five per cent of the time no one ever knows why sudden sensorineural hearing loss occurs because we can\u2019t get to the inner ear to examine it without risking damaging it, or damaging the brain,\u2019 says John Phillips, the consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust who treated Leesa. The most popular theory is that it\u2019s caused by a virus damaging the nerve in the inner ear. Another is that a blood clot blocks a blood vessel that leads to the inner ear. A benign tumour on an inner ear nerve may also cause sudden hearing loss \u2014 but this is rare. Whatever the cause, losing your hearing suddenly can be \u2018very traumatic\u2019 says Mr Phillips. \u2018Hearing loss usually occurs in one ear so people get scared it will happen in the other ear, too. They often get balance problems because the inner ear contains the balance organ, the labyrinth, too. Leesa (pictured) initially assumed that the problem was caused by a wax blockage and that it would correct itself within a few days. \u2018Losing balance function on one side can make someone feel disorientated before the brain eventually adapts.\u2019 And the damage is often permanent. One year after sudden hearing loss, a third of patients don\u2019t recover any hearing, a third recover fully and the remainder have some hearing loss. Waking up one morning having suddenly lost your hearing is considered a medical emergency and, if this happens, you should see a doctor that day, advises Mr Phillips. It may be hard for patients to distinguish a genuine emergency from the muffled hearing that comes with a cold, so see a GP if in doubt. Steroids are currently the only treatment option to help patients regain some hearing \u2014 they can improve the outcome, in some cases, if taken within two weeks and are thought to help by calming inflammation. They used to be given orally, but the latest thinking is to inject steroids directly into the eardrum. The number of people in Britain with hearing aids. \u2018If someone loses all their hearing, cochlear implants can cost up to \u00a340,000, so prevention of permanent deafness is key,\u2019 says Mr Phillips. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found there is \u2018less recovery of hearing when treatment is delayed\u2019. It\u2019s also less likely to return in under-15s and over-65s, although it\u2019s not known why, as well as in people who suffer from vertigo or who had poor hearing beforehand. Thankfully, Leesa\u2019s hearing has partially returned \u2014 which is likely to be down to her seeking medical help quickly. When she saw Mr Phillips, a week after her symptoms appeared, he prescribed a three-week course of steroid tablets. \u2018On the fifth day of", "abstract": "Leesa Barrell woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear and was later diagnosed with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which affects up to 6,000 adults a year.

And the world No 4, who is marrying Kim Sears on April 11 in Dunblane Cathedral, has not entirely ruled out playing in the Monte Carlo Open in the week immediately afterwards. He thinks that unlikely, but as one of the most momentous days in his eventful life looms he is adamant that he can compartmentalise such questions and focus on the Miami Open, his last tournament as a single man. Andy Murray practices in Florida ahead of his opening match at the Miami Open this week. Andy Murray takes time out to sign autographs for supporters in Florida on the second day of the Miami Open. The world No 4 poses with fans  at the Crandon Park Tennis Centre. Murray happily signed autographs ahead of his opening match against either\u00a0Donald Young or Yen Hsun Lu. After reaching the semi-final in Indian Wells last week Murray is now the second highest points scorer on the ATP Tour this year, albeit some way behind the dominant Novak Djokovic. He now arrives at the event hosted by the city he considers a second home \u2013 where\u00a0plays either Donald Young or Yen Hsun Lu\u00a0\u2013 and is not finding it hard to separate the two biggest things in his life, happy to discuss the forthcoming nuptials with Kim when relaxing at his downtown apartment. 'Tennis is important but we also have lives to live as well,' he said on Tuesday. 'When I'm on the court I'm not thinking \"I'm getting married in a few weeks\" but back at the apartment there's time to do that. I can concentrate on both. 'As long as it's not in the forefront of my mind when I'm training then it's fine. It hasn't been a problem for me yet and I don't see it as an issue.' Whatever happens at this tournament the 27 year-old Scot will not rush back across the Atlantic: 'Hopefully it won't finish for me here until a week on Sunday and then I'll go home after that,' said Murray, who is having not just one but three best men: brother Jamie, former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins and an old friend from Spain, Carlos Mier. Murray said he is shelving plans for a honeymoon after marrying Kim Sears in April until later this year. The 27-year-old, who has started the year in good form, waits to speak to members of the media on Tuesday. Murray says he is coping fine juggling his tennis and planning a wedding. Murray is marrying long-term partner Sears in his hometown Dunblane on April 11. 'If I don't do well I'm going to stay here anyway and train on the clay and get used to playing in hot conditions. Regardless of how I do I'll be here for the next ten days.' With his 28th birthday looming time is short and Murray's first few weeks as a married man will involve getting stuck into the clay with little luxuriating in his new status. He will play in Munich, Madrid and Rome before the French Open, and might even take his new bride straight to the Riviera. 'Depending on how I feel after the wedding there's potential to play Monte Carlo, but I'd say that's unlikely. The honeymoon won't be until the end of the year.'

'My mind is a lot clearer and I think that's shown,' he said. 'Last year I came here and had struggled for the first three months and physically I was still not feeling great after surgery. I hadn't seen Ivan much, probably for only three to four weeks since my surgery (in late September) and there wasn't much direction. That carried on for a bit after I finished here.

Both sides made a bright start and it lit up even more for the home side when they took the lead in the ninth minute when Murphy got his 22nd of the season after nine minutes. Richard Chaplow's deep corner was nodded towards goal by Christophe Berra and the league's leading marksman was on hand to cleverly poke the ball home off the inside of the post. Murphy almost grabbed his second when he took advantage of dithering from Liam Moore and David Button to take the ball away from the Brentford goalkeeper - but he could only find the side-netting from a near-impossible angle. The home side were on top with Jonathan Parr narrowly missing the far post with a fierce cross-cum-shot while, at the other end, Ipswich keeper Dean Gerken did well to hold Alex Pritchard's curling effort from the edge of the area. However, Brentford were level when Gerken did brilliantly to parry Stuart Dallas' volley but Douglas was on hand to head home the rebound.

Ipswich Town's Balint Bajner (centre) plays the ball out of trouble after being surrounded by Brentford men.

Ipswich almost grabbed the lead just before the interval when a great breakaway saw Chaplow's shot well saved by Button, before Judge made a brave sliding block to deny Parr the rebound. The home side should have been ahead less than a minute after the restart when Parr broke into the box and perfectly crossed for Murphy who somehow slid the ball over the bar - and the gaping empty net - from five yards out.

Cole Skuse (left) brings the ball forward as Ipswich search for a winner, but they were unable to find one. In a chance reminiscent of Parr's in the first half, Berra could only push a good chance wide of the far post on 54 minutes.

Back came Brentford with Pritchard's free-kick well held by Gerken before Murphy missed another gilt-edged chance on 65 minutes when the striker raced clear but was denied by a brilliant save from the onrushing Button. Ipswich continued to create the better chances as the second half progressed, with Murphy's shot at Button lacking power and then sub Chris Wood heading wide under pressure. Eight minutes before the end, Teddy Bishop tricked his way through the defence but his low left foot shot was brilliantly saved by man of the match Button.

In a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama said, 'folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law, you\u2019ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free.' Cruz led a 2013 filibuster in the Senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law, making it easier to legislatively dismantle. Scroll down for video. President Barack Obama challenged Republicans who oppose Obamacare to come up with an alternative at an event today celebrating the fifth anniversary of the law. To\u00a0'folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law,'he said, 'you\u2019ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free' He and his allies were eventually defeated in that effort after a two-week stand off with Democrats, who held the majority in the upper chamber at the time. But he has continued to fight to have the law nullified and named repeal a top priority in a speech announcing his candidacy for higher office on Monday. The White House was won't to react that afternoon to Cruz's entry into the 2016 brawl but it did rib him over his campaign promise to throw out the sitting president's signature policy achievement. 'Well, there was a presidential candidate who ran in 2012 promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that campaign pledge didn\u2019t work out very well for him,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters, referring to that year's Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney. In a twist of irony, Cruz said Tuesday that he would sign his family up for Obamacare. Previously included in a plan in the name of his wife, a Goldman Sachs employee, Cruz's family will lose its health care soon as she leaves her job to join him full time on the campaign trail. Earnest resisted taking a shot at Cruz over the matter on Wednesday, saying that if he does apply for a plan via the government marketplace, 'he will find is what millions of Americans across the country have found,' which is that there are good quality healthcare plans available  because of the health care reform law. While others have pointed out the irony of the situation, 'I am seeking to merely point out the common experience that it seems that the Cruz family may be sharing,' Earnest told a reporter pressing him on the issue. At the event on Wednesday, Obama said critics of the law need to explain 'why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure. Or why we should go back to the days when women paid more for coverage than men' and a 'preexisting condition locked so many of us out of insurance.' The president said that because of the law, 'If you\u2019re a woman, you can no longer be charged more just for being a woman. 'And you know there are a lot of women. Like more than 50 percent,' he said, eliciting laughter from attendees of the White House-sponsored event for private and public sector health care workers. 'This law is also saving lives - lives that touch all of us,' he said. 'It\u2019s working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund, and defame this law.' Defending the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare after its biggest backer, the president, Obama said, 'It\u2019s not the \u201cjob-killer\u201d that critics have warned about for five years.' In fact, after it was passed, 'businesses began the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record,' he said, noting that the economy has added 12 million new jobs in the last 60 months. 'It\u2019s not the fiscal disaster critics warned about for five years. Health care prices are rising at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years, which has helped cut our deficit by two-thirds since I took office,' he contended. Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, health care costs were projected to be the'single biggest driver' of new deficits. 'Today, health care is the single biggest factor driving those projections down,' he said. 'We have been promised a lot of things these past five years that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case: death panels, doom. A serious alternative from Republicans in Congress,' he said. The comment was a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Cruz, pictured here on Monday at his campaign kick off, led a 2013 filibuster in the Senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law, making it easier to legislatively dismantle.

{"article": "With her dark sunglasses and stony expression, the image of Hillary staring at her smartphone made her look such a boss that it launched its own Tumblr parody account. The photograph, which dates from a trip to Tripoli, Libya in September 2011, was even adopted by the former Secretary of State herself for her Twitter profile picture. But it seems the picture, which inspired hundreds of comedy memes, could be no laughing matter for Clinton as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun. Indeed, Clinton herself has removed the image removed from her Twitter account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in Libya. For more than a year, the former Secretary of State had used the monochrome image of her using a Blackberry on board a C-military plane around a month after Colonel Gaddafi's regime fell. Switcheroo: Hillary Clinton swapped out a picture of her using a Blackberry on her way to Libya for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative. The picture, regularly seen by her 2.9 million followers, was removed Sunday -  to promote a political campaign for gender equality, timed to coincide with International Women's Day. The image was once a symbol of Clinton's funny side as the face of the Texts From Hillary meme, which she said had given her'many LOLZ'. But the change also comes at a time when senior figures in Congress are intensifying scrutiny of Hillary's communications from 2009-13, which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official State Department accounts. Proof? The chairman of the House Committee on Benghazi mentioned that he has seen no emails from Clinton's time in Libya, despite pictures such as this one from 2011, showing her using a Blackberry. The picture  inspired hundreds of comedy memes posted on a parody Tumblr account last year. This one refers to Carly Rae Jepsen's pop song Call Me Maybe. A lot of the memes make a joke about how serious Clinton looks and speculate about what she's doing on her phone. The image of Clinton staring at her smartphone with her dark sunglasses and stony expression make her look like she doesn't have time for anyone. Clinton has handed over swathes of communications from the time, but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. The image was mentioned by the chairman of a House committee into the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi to suggest that vital communications from Clinton's involvement in Libya were being kept from public view. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina), today told CBS's Face the Nation\u00a0that he has been provided with no emails from the September 2011 trip - despite Clinton being clearly pictured communicating while aboard the plane. He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip. Users couldn't resist creating memes that make Clinton look like she receives lots of invitations to parties. Some make a joke out of  those intending to run against Clinton, like Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Others imagine Clinton talks to other famous internet faces over youth behaviour including grumpy cat. Clinton made this entry into the Texts From Hillary account herself - the entry does not insult any political rivals, but just ribs the site's creators. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress. 'So, there are huge gaps. And with respect to the president, it's not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what is a public record and what's not.' Gowdy also said the records don't include anything from around the dates of the Benghazi attack itself, in which the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed. Suspicions: Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina) mentioned the pictured of Clinton while contending that emails from her time in Libya had not been handed over. As of Sunday evening, Clinton's profile still featured the Blackberry image, but as the 'header photo' displayed at the top of the Twitter page. In order to see it, users have to access her profile directly. The image will not appear in the timelines of her followers, nor when she is retweeted or appears in search results. Clinton herself tweeted to explain the change of profile picture. She wrote: 'See my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide.' She also included a link to Not-There.org, which is sponsored by the Clinton foundation she runs with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.", "abstract": "Hillary Clinton has removed a photograph from her Twitter account that could be a figurative smoking gun, as it shows her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in Libya.

Kate Morgan said she felt 'numb' when she came face-to-face with Ian Edwards, who was responsible for the death of her 22-year-old daughter Lona Wyn Jones. But the prison meeting allowed her to recover from the trauma of losing her daughter, and to have a good night's sleep for the first time in two years. Confrontation: Kate Morgan, left, had a meeting in prison with killer driver Ian Edwards, right, after her daughter Lona died in a high-speed crash.

Edwards, 25, was jailed for three years and nine months after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, but Ms Morgan, 45, was haunted by the crash afterwards. 'After Lona's death I felt like I was living in a bubble,' she said. 'I was completely numb for a long time. I did want Ian to get some punishment, but it wasn't particularly important to me whether he was jailed. Five minutes or 1,000 years in jail wasn't going to bring Lona back. 'Months later, when life without Lona wasn't getting any easier, I realised that I had questions only Ian could answer. When the family liaison officers were with me one day, I suddenly asked out of the blue if I could go and meet him in prison.' After Edwards agreed to the hour-long meeting, Ms Morgan travelled with a friend to Risley prison in Warrington, Cheshire to meet the driver, who was accompanied by his father.

'I was apprehensive on the morning of the visit, but it was something I needed to do,' she said. 'I wanted the crash explained to me, to know whether it had happened the way I'd been told. And I wanted to look him in the face and see how it had affected him. 'I went to see Ian because I needed answers. I had to know exactly how Lona had been killed, before I could even try to move on. When I first saw him I felt numb. I can remember looking at him and thinking, you b******. 'In that situation you're only allowed to ask three questions, but I only wanted to ask the one. He could tell that was the real reason I was there, so he talked me through the crash. He admitted he and another driver had been speeding, racing each other. 'The other car had pulled back into his lane, he said, which had made him swerve and mount the grass verge. I could see how sorry he was and he apologised repeatedly. 'I told him I accepted his apology but I didn't forgive him and hoped to never see him again. That night, I slept properly for the first time in two years. 'Afterwards, I felt instantly more at ease because I no longer had the \"not knowing\" feeling. I finally had closure - there were no more secrets.'

Lona, a carer from Dolgellau, had started renting her own house near her mother and 12-year-old sister Ella shortly before the fatal crash. Edwards was said by eyewitnesses to have been 'driving like a lunatic' in his Ford Fiesta as Lona sat in the back seat, before he lost control and flipped the car over. Lona died at the scene from head injuries. Ms Morgan said: 'Lona had come to see me in the afternoon. She was still all excited about her cottage - she'd just got a new fridge freezer and had stocked it up, so I joked that she'd have to invite me and Ella round for tea at the weekend. 'She was going to her dad's that evening. He lived about 20 miles away so her best friend Fay and another friend Ian, who I'd not met before, were going to give her a lift. 'They arrived at about 5.30. Ian had a silver Ford Fiesta and I waved them off, giving Lona a big hug before she went.

These indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever-golden horizon. Look at them. They are in furs before they are five, Chanel before six and in bed by seven. And while dressed in the finest of clothes, they eat in the best restaurants, are entertained like emperors and hot-housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush. Meanwhile, the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed, doting, cash-scattering parents. Scroll down for video. First birthday bling: Tama Ecclestone's little girl Sophia. Thank goodness the tots always have a gem-encrusted rattle to hand, perhaps to shake at the folly of it all. Take Tamara Ecclestone. You can always depend on Tams to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy \u2014 and this week she did not let us down. The 30-year-old daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone and her husband, Jay Rutland, have just returned from a holiday in Italy to celebrate his birthday. Before their next holiday, they had the small matter of celebrating daughter Sophia\u2019s first birthday this week \u2014 and Tamara was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten. Not by Sophia, who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head. But by everyone else who goggled at the \u00a370,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their London home into Sophia\u2019s very own petting zoo, complete with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra. A rather glum-looking zebra, to be honest, but in terms of competitive party-throwing, the little critter certainly earned his stripes. There was also a real live princess, complete with a wimple, and a platoon of security men delivering gift-wrapped presents for the lucky baby. In pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with Sophia\u2019s initials picked out in white. As well as a petting zoo with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra, Sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons. If you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on Mr Blobby, wonder no more. Tamara also posted photographs on social media of Sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas, surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons. Another gift, wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon, awaited her perusal on her high chair tray. What and who was all this lavish fuss for? Certainly not for the child, who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on. However, events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than celebrating a birthday. That\u2019s not to say Tamara is not a lovely mother. Her utter joy and delight in her baby is clear for all to see. Yet one wonders what will happen to all these poor little rich kids, barely out of the crib before they are bombarded by all the good things in life \u2014 and then some. This torrent of luxury is supplied by no doubt well-meaning parents who seem not to know the meaning of restraint, the value of a pound or the concept of modesty. Few of them have ever had to worry where the next million is coming from and sometimes there is the uncomfortable thought that children are just another accessory, a toy to pamper, a blank canvas upon which they can express how very, very rich they are and how very, very different their lives are from ours.

Tian Tian in her enclosure: She was artificially inseminated today with an attempt at natural mating to follow. Tian Tian the panda in her enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo:\u00a0On the two previous occasions keepers have inseminated her she has failed to produce a panda cub. Semen from Yang Guang was used in the procedure carried out by a team of three vets at the zoo, alongside a panda expert from China. Iain Valentine from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which runs Edinburgh Zoo, said: 'Natural mating will also be attempted today before the short breeding window comes to a close this afternoon. 'Both pandas remain extremely interested in one another, but as Tian Tian's transition to peak was so rapid it was a priority to move straight to artificial insemination first. 'Throughout yesterday Tian Tian remained very quiet and sleepy, but by 5pm there was a behavioural shift and the results of hormone tests that came back at 7pm, carried out by the University of Edinburgh, confirmed ovulation had occurred. 'As each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year, this is why we start hormone monitoring via urine samples so early and continually observe our female via CCTV as the window approaches.

The Mercedes driver, and current world champion, beat Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel into second place who himself snatched a front row berth away from countryman Nico Rosberg in the final seconds of qualifying. \"It was a fantastic job for the team to have us both up here again,\" Hamilton said, referring to teammate Rosberg's third place finish. Tension? Initially it had appeared that the tensions that had marked last season's title race had re-emerged. Hamilton aborted a flying lap after it looked like Rosberg had blocked him. But both men played down the incident in the post-qualifying press conference. Rosberg, for his part, was more annoyed that Vettel had managed to steal second place at the death. \"I just didn't drive well enough, I'm annoyed by that,\" Rosberg said. \"Third place is not good enough.\" Deluge. Qualifying took place amid spectacular thunderstorms which delayed qualifying by half an hour. Indeed, Malaysia has become known for such conditions. The 2012 race was halted for an hour and in 2009 abandoned altogether and awarded to Jenson Button after 31 laps.

{"article": "Doctors  stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery. And in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone. A San Francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person\u2019s breath that could hint at an underlying illness. Doctor in a stick? The very early model of the sensor (pictured) has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies. The very early model of the sensor has been created by San Francisco-based BoydSense and is on display at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released either through everyday metabolic activity, or by diseases in the body. Once created, they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. Some compounds, including carbon for instance, are released naturally. BoydSense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal. It uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean. It is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. If the sensor is added to a smartphone, for example, a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically. In particular, the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer. In addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath, Mr Thuillier said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food. In the MailOnline demo, the BoydSense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds. BoydSense\u2019s boss Bruno Thuillier gave MailOnline a demo of the technology at Mobile World Congress. The current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth - although Mr Thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves. It takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise, a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous \u2018sniffs\u2019. This process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version, however. For the demo, the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges. Within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone. This was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities, but Mr Thuillier explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential. If attached to a smartphone, the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best-before date, or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn. Mr Thuillier said: \u2018I am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere, anytime. This platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness. BoydSense aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics.\u2019", "abstract": "San Francisco-based BoydSense has developed a sensor that can identify gases and molecules released in a person's breath that could hint at an underlying illness.

Having beaten a host of highly regarded players to reach the fourth round of Indian Wells last week, she nearly came unstuck against the nuggety Russian, ranked a modest 95 in the world.

{"article": "Just as I can't travel to Liverpool without thinking of The Beatles, so I can't travel to Los Angeles without thinking of The Beach Boys. Their songs of beaches, baggies, boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun-kissed paradise, and their voices sounded as bright and as laid-back as California itself. This time I was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band. Their songs sounded as bright as a sun-kissed paradise, their voices sounded as laid-back as California itself. I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group. The Wilson family home on 119th Street, where the boys taped their first single Surfin' in 1961, was demolished to make way for Interstate 105. The rest of the street remains though, its neat lawns, porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group's clean-cut All-American origins. A redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the Wilson house, with a bas-relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here 'broadcast to the world an image of LA as a place of sun, surf and romance'. Hawthorne is indeed a place of sun (263 days a year) but no surf and little romance. It's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry (Los Angeles International is only five miles away). I could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get 'bugged' driving 'up and down the same old strip'. Hawthorne Boulevard, with its low-rise jewellery shops and furniture stores, is no place for the young. The Pizza Show added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling Beach Boys. I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group. Now run by the son of the original owner, it retains its kitsch medieval Italian interior, with wrought iron chandeliers, tiled awnings and mock grilled windows. Foster's Freeze, another gathering place, is a blue-roofed fast-food outlet that offers food from one service hatch and ice cream from another. When I arrived Louie Louie, a 1963 hit by The Kingsmen, was playing over speakers in the overhang. This was the very 'hamburger stand' where Brian Wilson saw a girl pull up in her father's Thunderbird and had the inspiration for Fun Fun Fun. Hawthorne High School, around the corner on El Segundo Boulevard, is where the Wilson boys and Jardine attended. The Beach Boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song Be True to Your School. The nearest surfing beach to Hawthorne is Manhattan, but the best is Huntington Beach, better known as Surf City USA. Here the sand is soft, the surf is year-round, and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles. Other than Dennis Wilson, The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers, but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean-side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it. They mentioned Huntington Beach in Surfin' Safari. The city of Huntington Beach makes much of its surfers. There's a Walk of Fame, a Hall of Fame and a small International Surfing Museum. The sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses, caps and jeans. My hotel, the Waterfront Beach Resort, had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read Wiped Out rather than Do Not Disturb. It was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfers bobbing about in the ocean. From the pier I could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall, grey waves. As if on cue, a local surf music tribute band, The Breakaways dressed in faded blue denims and short-sleeved Hawaiian shirts, began playing at the pier entrance. An even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when The Surfaris drummer David Raven took me to an outdoor gig in Irvine, Orange County, where he played with bassist Jay Truax (ex-Nomads), and guitarists Ron Eglit (Dick Dale and his Band) and Paul Johnson (The Bel-Airs). They called themselves The Legends Surf Band. We picked up Johnson from his apartment. He was wearing a baseball cap, blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye. On the drive down he told me his story.

{"article": "Scientists claim they are one step closer to creating a drug that can cure HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus. In their tests, they found that the technique could completely remove up to 72 per cent of cells that had been infected with HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus (pictured) CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code. Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut \u2013 known as a double strand break \u2013 closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the Crispr system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. 'Evolution has led to some of the most astonishing mechanisms for protecting organisms against their natural pathogens,' says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory in California. 'Understanding the immune responses by which bacteria protect themselves against viral infections has allowed us to engineer novel platforms for the targeting of devastating viruses, such as HIV, in human patients.' When a copy of the HIV virus sneaks into a human cell, it can cause havoc. It takes control of the cell's own molecular machinery to made copies of the virus's genetic material and then buries these copies in the cell's own genes. From there, the host's cell becomes an HIV factory, making new copies of the virus to spread throughout the body. Existing HIV drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle; some stop the virus from integrating into cells' DNA, for instance, while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus. The problem with these drugs, explains Hsin-Kai Liao, a research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab, is that they don't actually remove the copies of the virus that are hidden within cells' DNA. These copies can remain dormant for years and then activate again. 'Patients normally need to take drugs every day or every week for their whole lives, because of the HIV that can be latent,' says Professor Liao. 'This costs money, time and effort.' To combat this problem, the team turned to a molecular defence system called CRISPR that bacteria use to cut up foreign DNA at specified spots. Since its recent discovery, scientists have started using CRISPR to edit genes. But the researchers were also intrigued by its defensive ability and wondered if CRISPR could be programmed to slice and destroy viruses inside human cells. The new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. Pictured are the study team, from left: John Martlett, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, Hsin-Kai Liao, Yuta Takahashi, Concepcion Rodriguez Esteban, Tomoaki Hishida and Mo Li. CRISPR uses bits of genetic material called guide RNAs to dictate its cuts, so the scientists developed guide RNAs that bound to unique spots on the HIV virus. They added CRISPR, the guide RNAs and other molecules needed for the system to work to immune cells that had been infected with HIV. They found that CRISPR successfully cut the right spots in HIV's genes, inactivating the virus. This resulted in the virus being completely removed from up to 72 per cent of cells. Not only did CRISPR chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell, but it also cut up HIV that was hidden and dormant within the cells' DNA. While other research groups have taken similar approaches in targeting CRISPR to HIV, the new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. The Salk team also illustrated in a more complete way how CRISPR targets HIV in living human cells, verifying that it works both before and after the virus is embedded in the genome. Not only did CRISPR chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell, but it also cut up HIV that was hidden and dormant within the cells' DNA. 'CRISPR can actually excise the virus out of the human genome,' Liao says. Next, Liao and his colleagues tried adding the CRISPR system to human cells before they becoming infected with HIV. 'Having the system in place, they showed, prevented an infection\u2013CRISPR chopped up any copies of the virus before they could start replicating.

{"article": "Gareth Lee (pictured leaving court today) said he was left'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when the bakery refused his order. A Christian baker who refused to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan has begun a court battle over equality laws. Belfast-based Ashers Bakery refused to make a cake featuring an image of Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie below the motto 'Support Gay Marriage'. Northern Ireland's Equality Commission is now supporting a legal action against the family-run bakery on behalf of gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose order was declined. Mr Lee told a court today he was left'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when one of the owners of the bakery, Karen McArthur, rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for. 'It made me feel I'm not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong,' he said. Opening the case, Robin Allen QC, representing Mr Lee, said the baker's objection on religious grounds was not lawful. He said baking a cake did not mean the bakers supported any message the cake might carry and compared the baking of a cake to a postman delivering a letter or a printer printing a poster. 'A postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support,' he said. 'It's simply a functional relationship, a working relationship.' The lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians, church figures, bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter. But the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone, saying: 'Law must not be determined by those who shout loudest.' Mr Allen QC said he was not in court to challenge the McArthur family's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an Ashers logo on it. The case is being heard at Belfast County Court by district judge Isobel Brownlie. The Commission, which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region, has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation. The case has sharply divided public opinion in Northern Ireland and beyond. In the wake of the bakery's refusal to provide the service last May, the commission, a state-funded watchdog body, took on the case on behalf of Mr Lee. Initially, the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer'modest' damages to the customer. Claims of discrimination were made after a Christian-run bakery in Northern Ireland refused to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan on it on religious grounds. Pictured, left: The design. Pictured, right: Belfast Councillor Andrew Muir cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery. Ashers bakery general manager Daniel McArthur, supported by his wife Amy (right), has said he is fighting the case to allow Christian business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms. When Ashers, which is owned by the McArthur family, refused, the commission proceeded with the legal action. Outlining his view of the facts, Mr Allen said Mr Lee had used the bakery in Royal Avenue in Belfast city centre'regularly' before the incident. He said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake. He said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to'religious scruples'. The barrister told the court that the order was accepted by Ashers director Karen McArthur and Mr Lee paid for it in full. 'A contract was therefore concluded,' he said. Mr Allen said that, over the next few days, Mrs McArthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter-in-law, Amy, and the matter was then discussed with her son, Daniel. After that Mr Lee was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family's religious views, said the lawyer. A court was told  that for the bakery to refuse to make the cake was like a postman refusing to deliver letters. Mr Allen said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then 'the law is worth nothing'. He added: 'The rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere.' The barrister insisted that Ashers was not an 'explicitly religious' business and referred to an interview Daniel McArthur gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his 60-plus workforce were unaware of his family's faith. Mr Allen stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in Northern Ireland, given its history of sectarian strife. Daniel and Amy McArthur sat on one side of an almost packed courtroom, with Mr Lee watching from the other side. The Ashers case has prompted the Democratic Unionist Party to propose a law change at Stormont that would provide an 'equality clause' which would essentially enable businesses to refuse to provide certain services on religious grounds.

The terrorist group released a photograph on Tuesday of a masked fighter it identified as Abu Daood Al-Amriki, an alleged American jihadist who committed the suicide attack. The claim grabbed headlines, but days later, neither CNN nor U.S. government officials have been able to confirm the identity of the attacker. ISIS claims the attacker used an explosives-laden vehicle to mount an attack in Samarra, Iraq.

{"article": "A federal judge blocked Nebraska's gay marriage ban on Monday, but the decision will not take effect for a week and the attorney general's office immediately appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska sued the state in November on behalf of seven same-sex couples challenging the ban, which passed with the approval of 70 percent of voters in 2000. In addition to prohibiting gay marriage, the ban also forbids civil unions and legalized domestic partnerships. The ban means that same-sex couples miss out on medical and financial benefits available to heterosexual married couples, U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon said as he issued the injunction. Legal fight: The ACLU of Nebraska sued the state in November on behalf of seven same-sex couples challenging the ban. ACLU of Nebraska Executive Director Danielle Conrad is seen speaking February 19. 'All of the plaintiffs have further demonstrated psychological harm and stigma, on themselves and on their children, as a result of the non-recognition of their marriages,' he said in the 34-page ruling. 'The plaintiffs have been denied the dignity and respect that comes with the rights and responsibilities of marriage.' Bataillon rejected the state's argument that the ban reflects the will of a majority of voters and promotes family stability. He said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately endorse same-sex marriage rights, which have been upheld in four appellate districts. 'The notion that some children should receive fewer legal protections than others based on the circumstances of their birth is not only irrational \u2014 it is constitutionally repugnant,' he said. His order blocking the ban takes effect March 9. Bataillon previously struck down Nebraska's gay marriage ban in 2005, saying it violated the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians. An 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel reinstated the ban in 2006. According to the court's online records, the Nebraska attorney general's office filed an appeal straight after Bataillon issued the injunction. A spokeswoman for Republican Attorney General Doug Peterson said attorneys in their office were reviewing the ruling and would issue a statement later Monday. Missouri, Arkansas and South Dakota have appeals against stays on same-sex marriage bans pending before the 8th Circuit. Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said the majority of Nebraskans voted for the constitutional amendment. 'The definition of marriage is an issue for the people of Nebraska, and an activist judge should not substitute his personal political preferences for the will of the people,' Ricketts said. Opposition: Gov. Peter Ricketts,\u00a0a Republican, said the majority of Nebraskans voted for the constitutional amendment which banned same-sex marriage. Couple: Susan Waters, left, and Sally Waters are seen February 24. They were legally married in California in 2008, are among the couples suing to overturn the ban. Susan and Sally Waters of Omaha, who have been together for 17 years and were legally married in California in 2008, are among the couples suing to overturn the ban. They returned to their native Nebraska in 2010. Sally Waters was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in 2013, and says that without formal recognition of their marriage, her spouse won't receive the same tax and Social Security benefits to take care of the couple's children and will have to pay an 18 percent inheritance tax on half of the property they share, including their family home. 'Today, Nebraska's motto of \"equality before the law\" rings true for gay and lesbian Nebraskans who seek to have their marriages recognized,' said Danielle Conrad, executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska. Gay marriage is currently allowed in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Supreme Court announced Jan. 17 that it would decide whether same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry everywhere in the U.S. A decision is expected by late June.", "abstract": "A federal judge has blocked Nebraska's gay marriage ban, which passed with the approval of 70% of voters in 2000, but the decision will not take effect for a week and the attorney general's office immediately appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Shakira, who lives in London with her husband, Tom, said that she was horrified to find that while she was pregnant people were constantly telling her she'd never get her shape back. She said: 'It was amazing and it shocked me that everyone was saying to me, \"You're never going to get your figure back.\" 'Even a midwife - not my own - said to me, \"There's nothing you can do, your boobs will be saggy, you'll never get your stomach back.\" 'And I just thought it was very demoralising for me and for that to be the message going out to other women.'

Shakira shared a photograph of herself on her first day back at the gym, she has since regained her impressive abs. 'Some people commented saying, \"I can't believe you're so self obsessed\", but it's not about that, it's about being happy and healthy and for me that means being in good shape.\u00a0It's important to feel good about yourself.' Shakira says she carried on teaching her exercises until just five weeks before Rio's birth, but that didn't stop her putting on weight when she was pregnant. The usually slim and toned Mother said she put on over two and a half stone. 'I was still teaching my classes up until about five or six weeks before he was born,' she said. 'I obviously wasn't lifting any heavy weights any more but I was keeping active and I have a chocolate labrador so he always needs walking. She continued: 'They say you put on about two and a half stone during the pregnancy but I had put that on by six months and you could really see it in my face. 'I would be lying if I said it never bothered me, there was one time I wanted to buy a dress and it was the kind of thing I would have always loved to wear but I just couldn't. 'But I made the choice to become a mother and I think pregnant women look beautiful.' Shakira's first run came 15 days after she gave birth, she jogged for 15 minutes and says it's important to build up your exercise regime slowly. Shakira says one of her favourite things to do is to put on her music and dance around her house. Shakira regularly shares photographs of herself enjoying her work outs on Instagram. Shakira has been showing off pictures of how her body has been changing, these pictures were taken 15 days after she gave birth to baby Rio. Shakira, who has worked with the pop singer Jessie J, revealed that when it came to getting back into shape, she found it was important to take things one step at a time. She said: 'I had to accept, you know, I'm not going to have two hours to go to the gym. But you just have to fit it in where you can. 'I do my exercise in short sharp bursts so if that baby is sleeping for an hour I might do half an hour of exercise. 'I'm lucky enough to have a garden so I'll pop outside where I will do some high knees, jumping jacks, burpees, press ups then some tricep drips and sit ups.' And she'll even dance around her house in a bid to get fit: 'One of my favourite things to do is to put some music on my headphones and just dance around my bedroom. 'I must look completely crazy to anyone if they looked in but I love dancing - I used to do musical theatre and also one of the things I missed the most when I was pregnant and having a baby was being able to go out to a club and dance", "abstract": "Shakira Martin, a fitness instructor from London, has shared her story of how she lost her baby weight in just eight weeks after giving birth to her son, Rio, in a bid to inspire other new mothers.

Hugo Selenski, 41, was convicted last month of two counts of first-degree murder for killing pharmacist Michael Kerkowski and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett in 2002 as part of a robbery plot.

Poundland founder Steve Smith pictured outside his Shropshire home, for which he is asking for \u00a35.75million. The property boasts seven bedrooms, five grand reception rooms, a dancefloor, bar and swimming pool. It also features a lavish pool room with a full size heated pool and hot tub. Pictured is one of the mansion's living rooms, adorned with expensive rugs.

Only 16-year-old Joe still lives at home, while Katie, 26, lives with her husband and two children in a converted barn on the 28-acre estate. He said: 'The house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave. We began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007. 'It was a real labour of love and no expense was spared. I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It\u2019s really unique and we\u2019ve had some great parties there.' When he bought Hammer Hill House in 2004, Mr Smith set about doubling the property in size, turning the quaint country house into a sprawling estate. The property listing boasts of the space afforded by the 28-acre estate  Country Life magazine once mooted as a possible base for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Mr Smith added: 'We've had the place for 11 - 12 years and I suppose I like projects, I get itchy feet and want to build something else. 'I'm looking for a site where I can create my own house and build the kids' houses. So I'm looking for a plot of land where I can build four houses and keep the family together.

Before the advertising watchdog\u2019s ruling, Poundland's website boasted: \u2018Everything for \u00a31 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we\u2019re still true to that vision today.\u2019 Under a heading \u2018Our Values\u2019, it added: \u2018We\u2019ve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the UK...We are very proud to offer you a single \u00a31 price, that hasn\u2019t changed since we opened our first store.\u2019 However, people complained to the ASA that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking DVDs of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for \u00a32 each. Poundland defended the breaking of its normal \u00a31 price barrier saying the \u00a32 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold.

After wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours, these images and video capture the dramatic moment a digger saved the large mammal from a trunkful of trouble in a heroic rescue mission. The heart-rending rescue took place near Makindu in southern Kenya, where local farmers were shocked to find the distressed male elephant desperately trying to escape from a deep mud pit. Scroll down for video. The digger gets to work to save the stricken elephant after he got stuck in the well in Chyulu Hills National Park, southern Kenya. The young mammal was stuck wallowing in the dank ditch for up to 12 hours before he was able to make its way out of the muddy water. This is the moment the elephant made its break for safety, after the digger was able to create a gentle slope out of the heavy clay. Unable to help the large mammal climb the steep clay sides, wildlife conservationists enlisted the aid of a heroic construction company, who used their digger to plough the elephant to safety. Conservation scientist and wildlife photographer Jeremy Goss, 30, was on the scene to capture these dramatic photos and video footage of the courageous rescue on farmland bordering Chyulu Hills National Park. He said: 'It was heartbreaking to see the elephant in the well, particularly because the community had not been very keen or able to help it out. 'Elephants raid their crops and are generally not welcome, but it was a shocking sight for them nonetheless.' It is believed the young African elephant, which can weigh up to seven tonnes, the same weight as a London double decker bus, had been trapped in the murky sludge for up to 12 hours after it fell in the well while taking a drink. The elephant was thought to be searching for water in the area, which is experiencing an unusually intense dry period, when it discovered the man-made drinking well on farmland bordering the park, near the town of Makindu. Local farmers were shocked to find the male elephant desperately trying to escape from a deep mud pit he had been trying to drink from. The rescue took place near the town of Makindu. Conservation scientist and wildlife photographer Jeremy Goss, 30, captured what happened. The elephant was thought to be searching for water in an area of southern Kenya which is experiencing an unusually intense dry period. The young elephant appears to make a plea for help with his trunk (left), through which he was at least able to breath while he was stuck (right) Wildlife conservationists and park rangers from The Kenya Wildlife Service and Big Life Foundation were quick to the scene to help excavate the animal from its muddy prison. After it became clear there was no way for wildlife rangers to break the slippery bank, it was left to a digger from Chinese company China Road and Bridge Corporation, working on a nearby railway, to cultivate a gap in the bank allowing the mammal to walk to freedom. Exhausted from the ordeal, the elephant, which was too tired to move from the ditch, was eventually encouraged to make its dash out onto the open plains after being nudged by the digger. Jeremy said: 'This elephant had gone into a human dominated farming area that borders a national park at night to find water in a man-made well. 'The area has been experiencing a very dry period and water is hard to find. 'He must have slipped in while drinking and couldn't get out because of the steep clay sides. 'Wildlife conservationists watched helplessly for hours as the animal struggled in the well, but thankfully the Chinese construction company came to the rescue by providing the machine. Wildlife conservationists and park rangers from The Kenya Wildlife Service and Big Life Foundation were quick to the scene. The elephant enjoys his new found freedom. He was exhausted from the ordeal and was nearly too tired to move from the ditch. The elephant was eventually encouraged to make its dash out onto the open plains after being nudged by the digger. 'The digger managed to get the elephant out by digging one side out of the well, the operator having to make precision movements to avoid hitting the elephant in the small well. 'Once it emerged, it seemed very tired but otherwise seemingly unharmed.' Following the rescue, rangers were called upon to escort the elephant from the farmland back into Chyulu Hills National Park, home to the highest mountain range in eastern Kenya. Using land cruisers in tandem with a helicopter, the rangers tried to push the elephant in the direction of the 100 kilometre long national park, preventing it from moving back towards other farms and settlements. Jeremy said: 'There was then a difficult process where rangers had to prevent the elephant from moving back towards other farms, there were still lots of people that had been watching the rescue and they had to flee as the elephant ran in different directions. 'But it was a wonderful moment watching him escape from the well. It was because of humans that he ended up", "abstract": "A young elephant fell into a mud pit in southern Kenya and was stuck there for up to 12 hours.

According to locals, Cherokee is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 300 native speakers left in the state. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the new division of New Kituwah Academy in January. The school has been operating since 2004 but up until now only taken students from early childhood through fifth grade. Continuing studies: A Native American language school for grades 6-12 will open in North Carolina in a bid to keep Cherokee culture alive - the New Kituwah Academy has only been open to young students up until now. From their earliest years, children learn only in Cherokee at the facility. Only in the higher grades is English introduced, mostly as a bow to parents concerned about what happens after their children leave the school. Cherokee had no writing system until the early 1800s, when the renowned silversmith Sequoyah wrote a syllabary to put its sounds on paper. While English has one symbol for every letter, Cherokee has one symbol for each of its 80-plus syllables. Unlike many other languages, which focus on nouns and adjectives, Cherokee focuses on verbs. One verb can reveal how many people are talking, what they're doing and how near they are. The near demise of the language came largely thanks to the U.S. government. Written words: This chart shows the Cherokee alphabet - there are now fewer than 300 native Cherokee speakers remaining in North Carolina. Learning process: Cherokee tribe member Haley Smith, 11, works on an English assignment at New Kituwah Academy in Cherokee. Most Cherokee were forced to make a brutal march from the Southeast to Oklahoma in the 1830s. A few stayed behind, keeping a desperate grip on their way of life. Then, beginning in the late 1800s, officials set up boarding schools to eradicate the American Indian languages. Teachers punished students for speaking their native tongues. Without New Kituwah or something like it, 'the Cherokee language will for sure die,' said Walt Wolfram, director of the North Carolina Language and Life Project at N.C. State University. 'Lots of people remain skeptical about whether languages can be revived. But the [other] option is certain death. In that sense, Kituwah Academy is the only antidote for what will be inevitable.' New Kituwah is one part of the Eastern Band's effort to preserve the language, said Annette Clapsaddle, director of the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, which has given almost $2 million to the school. Heritage: In this February 10, 2015 photo, a statue of Sequoya, creator of the Cherokee alphabet, stands in front of the New Kituwah Academy in Cherokee, North Carolina. Other initiatives include Cherokee language programs at public schools and a Cherokee studies program at Western Carolina University, she said. Throughout the U.S., Native American tribes in recent years have launched efforts to preserve their languages. The Cherokee nation in Oklahoma opened the Cherokee Immersion Charter School in 2002, said Julie Hubbard, a spokeswoman for Cherokees there. Students start at age three and go through eighth grade, when they can transfer to a public school or to Sequoyah High School, where the Cherokee immersion students study together, she said. New Kituwah - which has about 90 students - has had problems finding teachers fluent in Cherokee. Most native speakers are in their 60s and 70s and struggle with health issues, school administrators said.", "abstract": "A new Native American language school for grades 6-12 has been accredited in North Carolina to keep Cherokee culture alive.

Another third of gay male pupils said they left school without being taught anything about HIV or safe sex, despite a spike in infections nationwide. A survey by the National Aids Trust (NAT), which quizzed more than 1,000 gay or bisexual men aged 14 to 19, also found that more than half had experienced some form of discrimination. More than half of gay teenagers said they had been bullied at school. While 99 per cent said they had been targeted by a classmate, 39 per cent said their tormentor was a teacher or adult (file image) Of those 99 per cent said they had been targeted by another pupil, while 75 per cent said they received online abuse, reports The Independent. However, another 39 per cent said the bullying had been at the hands of a teacher or another adult at their school. Deborah Gold, the chief executive of NAT, said: 'It's an incredibly high number. 'The idea that teachers or other adults at school are sometimes responsible for bullying and discrimination is utterly unacceptable.' The survey also showed a worrying lack of education among young men about the spread of HIV and safe sex, despite them being in the most at-risk group in the UK. Two thirds of those surveyed said they had not been given information about testing for the killer virus, while a third were given no information about the spread of HIV. Another three quarters were also unaware of the drug PEP, which can help prevent infection if it is given to a patient within three days of them being exposed to HIV. A third of teenage boys said they had been given no information on HIV or safe sex, while two thirds said they didn't know how to test for it, despite being in the most at-risk group (pictured, the HIV virus) Three quarters of pupils also said they had been given no information on same sex relationships during sex educations lessons. Ms Gold added: 'The number of young men who have sex with men who are contracting HIV is increasing. I think there's an absolute link between the lack of this education at a time when people need it and the consequences of that.' While education on HIV is required as part of the science curriculum, it is only recommended as part of social and health education classes, with campaigners calling its application 'patchy'. The most recent figures from Public Health England show that HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men are at an all-time high, and are continuing to rise. In 2012 there were 3,250 new diagnoses of HIV among this group, pushing the total to more than 40,000, of which around 7,300 were unaware they had the virus.", "abstract": "A survey by the National Aids Trust (NAT) has found that one in five gay teenagers in schools across Britain are being bullied by teachers or other adults.

{"article": "Martin Skrtel was hit with a three-match ban on Wednesday for stamping on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, but the Liverpool defender escaped any further action after he appeared to mock the FA by posting a picture of clowns on social media. The photograph appeared on Skrtel\u2019s Instagram account on Wednesday morning, shortly before the FA announced that he had been found guilty of deliberately treading on De Gea towards the end of Liverpool\u2019s 2-1 defeat to their rivals at Anfield on Sunday. The FA are aware of the post but have decided not to take the matter further. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg in the incident which saw the FA charge the defender. Skrtel could have been in more trouble for posting this picture of clowns after the FA upheld his  ban. Premier League: Arsenal away,  April 4. FA Cup Sixth round: Blackburn away, April 8. Premier League: Newcastle at home, April 13. Skrtel, 30, had denied the FA charge which was brought on the basis of video evidence, after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident with De Gea. The Slovakia defender becomes the second Liverpool player to be banned for violent conduct in the game after Steven Gerrard was given an automatic three-game suspension for stamping on Ander Herrera just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute. Both players will now miss the trip to third-placed Arsenal a week on Saturday and Newcastle\u2019s visit to Anfield on April 13, as well as Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn five days earlier. Liverpool also have a number of injury concerns arising from the United game. Daniel Sturridge (hip) and Adam Lallana (groin) have withdrawn from England duty, while Raheem Sterling is expected to do the same after playing in tomorrow\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley. Skrtel was charged with violent conduct but claimed the alleged stamp was not intentional. A three-man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was missed by Martin Atkinson (right) Brendan Rodgers has a major selection headache ahead of the trip to Arsenal in the Premier League. Sterling has been having injections in a toe injury and is unlikely to risk aggravating the problem by playing in Tuesday\u2019s friendly with Italy. Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has been having scans on an ankle injury at Belgium\u2019s training camp after colliding with Wayne Rooney on Sunday and Dejan Lovren has pulled out of the Croatia squad with a recurring abdominal strain. Lovren would have been an ideal candidate to replace Skrtel, who made no secret of his feelings yesterday when the FA announced that he had been found guilty of deliberately treading on De Gea\u2019s right shin. A three-man panel of elite officials reviewed the footage on Monday and agreed unanimously that it was a red card offence. The 30-year-old denied the charge and argued that any contact with De Gea was unintentional, but an independent disciplinary commission decided otherwise yesterday. Captain Steven Gerrard was sent off after stamping on Manchester United's Ander Herrera on Sunday. Gerrard will also miss three games after seeing red for this stamp during the 2-1 defeat. An FA statement was released at lunchtime shortly after Skrtel had posted a photograph of four clowns on social media in what was interpreted as a clear dig at the authorities. The FA have been known to punish thinly-veiled criticism before \u2014 not least when Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was fined \u00a310,000 last season for bringing the game into disrepute after making sarcastic comments about match officials following a defeat by Sunderland. It is understood that they did not think there was enough evidence on this occasion to justify a similar charge against Skrtel. He is currently in Slovakia preparing for tomorrow night\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifier against Luxembourg and next week\u2019s friendly against the Czech Republic. Considering the problems afflicting Rodgers and his Anfield squad at the moment, it is probably just as well.", "abstract": "Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel has been given a three-match ban for stamping on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, but escaped further punishment after posting a picture of clowns on social media.

{"article": "Our pillar-box red, open-top Chevrolet would fail its MoT abysmally. The suspension has gone; only the driver's door opens from the inside and there doesn't even seem to be a speedometer. But it's still going and it's a lot of fun. A bit like Cuba, in fact. Everyone says you have to go now before the chicken nugget invasion changes everything following President Obama's decision to lift sanctions after 55 years. A place with a past and a future: Havana is an evocative city, rich in Spanish colonial architecture. For sure, change is needed in a country where almost everyone is denied access to the internet, where most people take home around $20 a month, where there is still rationing and where not believing in the 'Triumph of the revolution' still makes you an enemy of the state. But turning round this old tanker is going to take decades, not years. The real reason to go now is because for all their travails, the Cuban people are remarkably kind, honest and polite - and Havana is like nowhere else on Earth. Everywhere we go, there is a healthy scepticism about the Castro years and what might happen if outsiders are ever allowed to buy land and property. We're in the open-top Chevy (not driving it) on the way to Ernest Hemingway's house, 20 minutes from Havana. We've already downed a daiquiri at Floridita, where a statue of the great man occupies the end of the bar, and we've chased that up with a mojito at La Bodeguita del Medio, another of his hang-outs near the sublime Cathedral Square. Before the day is done, we'll sink more at La Terraza in the fishing village of Cojimar, the inspiration for The Old Man And The Sea, which helped Hemingway win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. At the wheel: Despite various mechanical troubles, Mark managed to take to the road in Cuba. He bought Finca Vigia in 1940 and lived there off and on for 20 years. It's pretty much how he left it. Bullfighting scenes and stuffed animals hang from the walls, his typewriter sits on the desk and rum competes for space with his books. Ask to see Ada and take along a translator. She has looked after the house for more than 20 years. When I ask her what Hemingway would make of Cuba today, her eyes fill with tears. 'I don't know,' she says, 'but Hemingway loved Cuba.' Back in Havana, our guide takes us to the Museum Of The Revolution, where Fidel, naturally, is the star of the show - but George W. Bush has a walk-on part in the rogue's gallery with the caption: 'Thank you cretin for helping us make socialism irrevocable.' Full of character: Trinidad is a touristy - but charming - colonial town  three hours south-east of Havana. What knocks us back is the beauty of the dilapidated grand houses, palaces and squares. It makes you wonder why on earth the British gave Cuba back to Spain in 1763 in return for Florida. Miami or Havana? No contest. A joke that still does the rounds is that the revolution failed on three fronts: breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it's no laughing matter. There's only so much dry fish with black beans on the side that a man in Havana can take. Our best dinner is at Mama Ines, where Fidel's ex-chef has opened his own restaurant. He's an engaging fellow and the walls are hung with black-and-white photos of him and his former boss. You absolutely have to eat at La Guarida, housed on the third floor of a glorious, crumbling building. The food is as dull as anywhere else, but the experience is exquisite: antique wine glasses, nicotine-stained walls, little balconies with room for one table each. There's music everywhere in Havana, of course. What takes us by surprise is the art. We have a tour of two studios where Fidel is caricatured as a false Jesus Christ and a sex maniac. Clutter and colour: Cuba's half-century on a limb has preserved Havana in a dilapidated but beautiful state. There aren't many decent hotels in the capital. We pick the pricey Saratoga opposite the vast Capitolio building (a metre higher than Capitol Hill, of which it is a near-perfect replica) because it has a pool on the roof. On the way to Trinidad, a colonial town three to four hours away, we call in at the Bay of Pigs and watch a 20-minute propaganda film about the failed U.S. invasion, then spend a couple of hours in Cienfuegos, which, frankly, leaves us cold, despite the 30 degree temperatures. Trinidad is charming, but touristy. Two nights here (we stay at the excellent Iberostar Grand) are ample", "abstract": "The article describes the unique experience of visiting Havana, Cuba before it changes due to the lifting of sanctions.

{"article": "NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens today revealed those working in the health service should 'practice what they preach' Overweight NHS staff will be told to take part in free slimming classes to shed the pounds, in order to set a better example to their patients, it has emerged. The drastic scheme could help 700,000 of NHS England's 1.3 million workforce, who currently struggle with their weight. In a drive to 'practice what we preach', the NHS will sign their employees up to one of three slimming classes, depending on the amount of weight they have to lose. Staff will be put on personal eating plans and be offered cognitive behavioural therapy to help reassess their relationship with food. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, who announced today's initiative, said: 'Today the NHS is starting to practice what we preach - helping our own staff get healthier and prevent illness. 'The 'h' in NHS stands for health, and that's going to require a far bigger emphasis on prevention.' It comes as Mr Stevens revealed tens of thousands of lives could be saved by a new initiative aimed at preventing people developing type 2 diabetes. The weight-loss pilot programme will initially be open to staff at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London. Porters, nurses, doctors and support workers have helped design the scheme. And there has reportedly been an overwhelming response from volunteers eager to sign up for the scheme. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: 'This is the first time this innovative approach to weight management has been piloted in the NHS. 'It is not just a weight-loss service but a comprehensive package of support, that includes eating better, being more active and improving self-esteem, which is tailored to the needs of NHS staff. 'By rolling out a public health scheme in our hospitals we are showing the nation that we are serious about tackling obesity and preventing life-threatening diseases.' Being obese and overweight can significantly increase a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. As such, a large proportion of cases could be prevented. Trials in the US, Japan, China and India have shown 30 to 60 per cent reductions in cases over three years in adults at high risk, after intensive lifestyle changes were introduced. The new National NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme, set to be unveiled by Mr Stevens at the Diabetes UK conference today, is set to run in line with the drive to improve the lifestyles of NHS employees. It is hoped the schemes will save lives as well as millions of pounds for the NHS by significantly reducing the four million people otherwise expected to develop type 2 diabetes in England by 2025. Mr Stevens revealed overweight NHS employees would be offered slimming classes to help shed pounds in a bid to set a better example for their patients (file image) England will be the first country to implement such a programme at scale, initially targeting up to 10,000 people at a high risk of type 2 diabetes followed by a national roll-out. 'The NHS already spends an estimated \u00a310 billion a year on potentially avoidable illnesses, and the human toll is more than 100 amputations a week and around 20,000 early deaths every year,' Mr Stevens said. 'Yet for over a decade we've known that obesity prevention cuts diabetes and saves lives. 'If these results were from a pill we'd doubtless be popping it, but instead this programme succeeds by supporting people to lose weight, exercise and eat better.' The programme is a joint initiative between NHS England, Public Health England (PHE) and Diabetes UK. PHE chief executive Mr Selbie said: 'This innovative programme is putting 'evidence into action' on the ground. 'Despite Type 2 diabetes being largely preventable, 2.5 million people in England already have the disease with another 9.6 million at high risk of developing it and this cannot be ignored.' Type 2 diabetes usually develops after the age of 40 and is more common in people who are overweight. Seven places around the country have been chosen to take part in the initial phase of the programme, involving drives on weight loss, physical activity, cooking and nutrition. These are Birmingham South and Central clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), Bradford City CCG, Durham County Council, Herefordshire CCG/LA, Medway CCG/LA, Salford CCG/LA, Southwark and Lambeth Councils and Southwark CCG. The weight-loss programmes, which include advice on healthy eating, come as NHS England announces another new initiative to help reduce the number of cases of type 2 diabetes, a condition closely linked to being overweight. Experts say the scheme will save lives as well as millions of pounds for the NHS. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'This is a real step change in terms of highlighting the seriousness with which type 2 diabetes is viewed and we feel this prevention programme is hugely significant. 'We hope this will also send a clear message that still more needs to be done going forward to help people lead healthy lifestyles from the beginning to the ends of their lives.'

John Danforth denounced the ugly nature of American politics Tuesday while eulogizing Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich, suggesting that political bullying and an anti-Semitic whisper campaign led his friend to kill himself. Danforth expressed 'overwhelming anger that politics has gone so hideously wrong' as he spoke at a memorial services that drew many of Missouri's top elected officials and hundreds of others to the Episcopal church that Schweich had attended in suburban St. Louis. 'Words do hurt. Words can kill,' Danforth said. 'That has been proven right here in this state.' Schweich, 54, fatally shot himself last Thursday in what police say was an apparent suicide at his home in Clayton. He left behind a wife, two children and an apparently rising political career. Missouri's top elected officials and hundreds of others gathered Tuesday at The Church of St Michael and St George in Clayton for the memorial services of state Auditor Tom Schweich. Former U.S. Senator John Danforth (left) delivered the euology at the service, and said campaign bullying was to blame for Schweich's (right) suicide. Schweich was running for governor at the time of his death. He had launched a campaign for the Republican nomination for governor just a month before his death and was already locked in a contentious primary with Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House speaker and U.S. attorney. Danforth, who is an ordained Episcopal priest, served 18 years as a Republican senator before retiring in 1995 and remains one of the more respected elder statesmen of Missouri politics. Danforth said he had talked with Schweich two days before his death. He said Schweich was upset about a radio ad from a political action committee that mocked his physical appearance and suggested he was a pawn of Democrats who would 'quickly squash him like the little bug that he is' in a general election.

(AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen, Pool) Former Sen. Danforth leaves The Church of St. Michael and St. George in Clayton, Missouri, after delivering the eulogy at the funeral for Schweich. Even though Schweich was an ordained Episcopal priest, he was allegedly mocked for his Jewish ancestry during the race. Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder leaves \u00a0church on Tuesday, March 3, 2015, after attending Schweich's funeral. Former U.S. Sen. Christopher 'Kit' Bond \u00a0also attended the Tuesday services for Schweich. But Danforth said Schweich was particularly distraught by what he perceived to be an anti-Semitic whispering campaign by the chairman of the Missouri Republican party, who Schweich said had been telling people that Schweich was Jewish. Schweich was Christian, but had some Jewish ancestry and had said his grandfather had long-encouraged him to stand up to anti-Semitism. The party chairman, John Hancock, has denied making anti-Semitic remarks, though he has acknowledged he mistakenly believed Schweich was Jewish and may have mentioned it in an off-hand way to some people. Hancock didn't attend the memorial service and declined to comment about Danforth's remarks. 'Today is not an appropriate time to engage in political back-and-forth,' state GOP Executive Director Jonathon Prouty said on Hancock's behalf. Schweich's former spokesman, Spence Jackson, said after the service that Hancock'should resign immediately' as Republican party chairman and that Hanaway should 'do some serious soul-searching about the race she's run so far and the people she's associated with.' Hanaway did not attend the funeral and a spokesman for her said she will not have any comment.

Danforth recited a passage from the gospel of Matthew in which Jesus describes as blessed those 'who are persecuted for righteousness sake' and against whom others 'utter all kinds of evil against you on my behalf.' He said Schweich was a'model public servant' who 'was a person easily hurt and quickly offended' \u2014 so much so that Danforth said he had tried to discourage Schweich from entering politics six years ago because he didn't believe Schweich had the temperament for it. Danforth said he is haunted by the fact that he had advised Schweich not to personally go public last week with the allegations of the anti-Semitic whispering campaign and had suggested Schweich should have someone else supply that information to the media. 'He may have thought that I had abandoned him \u2014 left him on the high ground all alone,' Danforth said.

The original Chauvet Cave is famous for its 36,000-year-old art, which dates back to prehistoric times and is believed to be the oldest in the world. In order to recreate the cave and its drawings with accuracy, 3-D modelling was used and some 6,000 digital images were overlapped in developing sketches. An expansive replica of the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave is scheduled to open to the public soon in southern France. In total, \u00a345million ($67million) has been spent to create the replica cave complex, which is situated inside a larger educational exhibition. Located one and a half miles from the original caves, construction began on the project in 2012 and is finally expected to be completed by April. The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave, discovered in 1994, is the length of two-and-a-half football fields and covers 68,000 square feet. Its five enormous chambers are not replicated to exact original proportions, but greater focus is given to highlighting the cave's impressive prehistoric art.

{"article": "He discovered a passion for flying somewhat late in life. But Harrison Ford embraced it with gusto and claimed to fly his planes as much as he drove his vintage cars. The actor was 52 when he first seriously started flying lessons and over the years the Indiana Jones star has amassed an impressive aviation collection. The experienced and respected pilot keeps the aircraft at the Santa Monica Airport - which is where he was where he had taken off from in his two-seater PT- 22 shortly before he crashed on a nearby Venice golf course on Thursday. Current fave: Harrison Ford has been seen several times lately flying his silver and yellow PT-22 two-seater vintage plane in and out of Santa Monica Airport. He was last photographed taking off in the aircraft last Friday. A real-life action man: Ford, 72, once said that learning to fly gave him freedom and pleasure and he's survived a number of crashes over the years. The Ryan PT-22 Recruit with its silver metallic body and eye-catching yellow trim was built in 1942 and was primarily designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Corps. Ford was regularly seen flying it in and out of Santa Monica Airport and was last photographed in it just a week ago on Friday February 27. In an interview with The Mail On Sunday back in 2010, the Blade Runner and Star Wars actor talked about some of the planes in his collection and the reasons he loves flying so much. 'Flying is like good music: it elevates the spirit and it's an exhilarating freedom.' he said. 'It's not a thrill thing or an adrenaline rush; it's engaging in a process that takes focus and commitment. Aviator: The 72-year-old actor keeps his collection of planes at Santa Monica Airport and routinely flies himself to and from his ranch in Wyoming. Ford, 72, has a long range jet, a Citation Sovereign,  a turboprop aircraft capable of operating on unimproved airstrips; and a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver single engine bush plane. He also has a 1929 Waco Taperwing open-top biplane, an Aviat Husky, which is a two-seat fabric-covered bush plane, and a Bell 407 helicopter. In 1999, Ford was flying his helicopter along the Lake Piru riverbed, north-east of Los Angeles, when it went down in a hard landing during a routine training session. 'All of my planes are great to fly, and that's why I've got so many of them': The Indiana Jones star's collection includes an Aviat Husky, a Canadian de Havilland Beaver and several Cessnas as well as a 1929 open-top bi-plane and a Bell helicopter. After landing hard the aircraft  began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log and flipped onto its side. Neither the actor nor his instructor were hurt although the helicopter was severely damaged. He later joked the incident gave him the opportunity to buy a new helicopter. The family that flies together.....: The star often uses his private jet to fly his wife, actress Calista Flockhart and their son Liam from place to place. Ford once described crashing a plane as being like scraping a bumper and said he used his planes as much he used his cars. 'I'm so passionate about flying, I often fly up the coast for a cheeseburger,' he said in 2010. The Hollywood star often flies to and from his  ranch in Wyoming and has used his helicopter there to aid Search and Rescue crews locate missing hikers. It's not a Millenium Falcon but the Han Solo actor still loves flying his own planes and is happy to do it all, even carrying his own bags on and off the aircraft. Ford has twice assisted local search and rescue teams with his helicopter, including one instance in which he picked up a hiker who became dehydrated. He donated his flying skills to non-profit organizations, including Operation Smile and the Special Olympics, and flew medical personnel and supplies to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. The father-of-five has played leading roles in at least two rescues, helping evacuate a missing hiker and a Boy Scout on separate occasions in 2001. Up in the air: Ford who just confirmed he plans to make a sequel to the 1982 cult classic Bladerunner, is a veteran pilot with 20 years experience. With his need for speed, Ford collects vintage cars and motorbikes,. He has about a dozen motorcycles including several BMWs, a couple of Harleys, Hondas and a Triumph. He has vintage cars too including a rare 1955 forest green convertible  Jaguar XK 140 worth about $150,000. Ford is married to actress Calista Flockhart and they have a teenage son Liam.

{"article": "Terrorists have developed several new techniques to communicate with each online by leaving coded messages on websites like eBay and Reddit, claims a new book. The shocking discovery made by intelligence officers and code breakers in Israel, Britain and the United States revealed that seemingly innocuous chats are often much more, according to new sections in the book Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad. Code breakers found that al-Qaeda is now using a technique to encrypt its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay. Communication: Terrorists have developed several new techniques to communicate with each online by leaving coded messages on websites like eBay and Reddit. Secretive: Code breakers have found that al-Qaeda is now using a technique to encrypt its messages in goods offered for sale on eBay. Meanwhile, Israeli intelligence officers who spent time tracking the Internet message board Reddit found more than once, that a terrorist used hexadecimal characters and prime numbers as code. After the messages were decoded, they sometimes indicated an attack was being planned or even about to happen, according to excerpts printed in\u00a0The New York Post. Terrorists are even hiding messages in 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target,' one intelligence source told author Gordon Thomas. In a fight back, MI6 in London and Mossad have recruited linguist specialists in Arabic, Urdu and Pashto to translate the online magazines that both al-Qaeda and ISIS are publishing with instructions. This, they hope will infiltrate a message about a planned attack before it takes place. In the wake of the brutal Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, both ISIS and al-Qaeda have been concealing messages to their followers. Both Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, and MI6 in London confirm that there has been an increase in this type of traffic online, according to the book. Cyber unit: The eleventh director of Mossad, Tamir Pardo, pictured, determined that Israel would use a cyber unit to avoid experiencing an event similar to the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Electronic war: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the country's electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as Israel's most important defense. Mossad: The front page of the website for Israel's spy agency says it sees the 'invisible' and does the 'impossible' However, when an attack appears imminent in a particular country, Mossad sends details to that nation's intelligence service's cybercommand. By working with each other in unison, intelligence agencies hope to  prevent future attacks. Cyber units worldwide are becoming increasingly important in the fight against terror. A number of the most skilled cryptologists in the Mossad unit for example, have mastered steganography, how to conceal secret information within a digital file. Cryptologists have the ability to explore an area inaccessible to the search engines of Google, Yahoo and Bing called the dark side, or dark web. This no-go zone contains billions of Web pages and is estimated to be 5,000 times larger than any other on the Internet. Much of this information is detailed in a 2015 version of a book by author Gordon Thomas called 'Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad.' It delves into the clandestine world of Israel's spy agency, the Mossad. Mossad is using its new cyberwarfare department to track threats and attack Iran's nuclear capacity. The eleventh director of the spy agency, Tamir Pardo, was determined that Israel would not experience an event similar to the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. This decision came after it was revealed that an intercepted phone message by the American National Security Agency hinted at the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - but it was caught too late. Pardo understood the importance of cyberwarfare after undergoing training at the NSA. He was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told him that their electronic battles against cyberattacks were regarded as Israel's most important defense. Meanwhile, Iain Lobban, the head of Britain's Government Communication Headquarters revealed the country's Ministry of Defense was once targeted over 1,000 times a month. He identified the attacks were mostly coming from the Tenth Bureau, the highly secret department of China's People Liberation Army responsible for science and technology. In the United States, General Keith B. Alexander, the head of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, confirmed that 'our targets are enemy military command centers that we can reach from cyberspace.'", "abstract": "Terrorists are using new techniques to communicate with each other online, including leaving coded messages on websites such as eBay and Reddit, according to a new book.

Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined \u00a32,000 in March 2014 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for Torquay - a charge which he denied. Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities. Stevenage's Ronnie Henry (in the white) accused Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie of biting him. 'So in passing comment, word is around the place that there's been an incident and the police are involved. He's (Henry) not in a good situation, he's in the treatment room and he's suffered quite a nasty injury. 'Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don't go on a football pitch expecting to lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it's a football match and he's nearly lost his finger.' The game had already threatened to boil over before Labadie and Henry's clash due to the nature of Dagenham's winning goal. Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for Dean Howell to score. But only after long consultation with his assistant did referee Dean Whitestone award the goal. Stevenage manager Graham Westley said that the alleged incident had become a 'police matter' In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal. Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club. Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup. The Barcelona forward was banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months and received a nine international match suspension.

Mr Hockey says it is due to the aging population in Australia that the role superannuation needs to be reconsidered, the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald reports. However the notion has been met with discontent among the Grattan Institute, Labor and the superannuation association, who warn that house prices will rise if the idea was put into place. This comes as the recent release of the Abbott government's Intergenerational Report revealed a snapshot of the next 40 years, showing Australians can expect to live into their mid-90s in 2055. First home buyers may be allowed to spend their superannuation to help them buy a property, Treasurer Joe Hokey has proposed. Mr Hockey said on Friday that the government may have to make fundamental changes to the superannuation system, considering Australia's ageing population. 'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I am concerned about rising house prices and the accessibility to homes and homeownership for younger Australians, but we've got a limited pool of savings. We need to have these conversations.' However John Daley from the Grattan Institute told the Sydney Morning Herald he was against the prospect, saying that Mr Hockey's proposal would only increase housing costs. 'It won't improve the problem around supply. If supply remains constant and you effectively increase the amount that people can pay then prices will go up. This is economics 101,'\u00a0Mr Daley said. 'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey said. Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen was also opposed to the notion as he told the Sydney Morning Herald that it goes against the principle behind superannuation. These views were echoed by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia as they expressed that such a proposal would only help those on higher salaries rather than Australians who earn less. On Thursday, the Abbott government's first intergenerational report was released and found that by 2054/55 there will be about 40,000 people aged over 100 years in Australia. These figures were compared to about 122 Australians aged over 100 in 1974/75 and around 4,000 now.

{"article": "Boston (CNN)She knew something awful had happened. It was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams. Her foot was turned sideways and her legs wouldn't work right. And her good friend, Krystle Campbell, was just lying there on the ground. Karen Rand -- she's Karen McWatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement. She wanted to get closer to Krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos. \"I got close to her, \" she recalled. \"For some reason, I got close to her head and we put our faces together.\" Krystle said that her legs hurt. They were the last words she'd speak. The two women held hands until Krystle's went limp. McWatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the United States for policies they believe inflict suffering on Muslims. Three people were killed in the blasts: Campbell, a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain; Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy; and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old grad student. More than 250 others were injured. And the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack, who recounted in detail the chaos of that day. Prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted. Tsarnaev's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors. McWatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people. Their two faces, side by side, stand out among the jumble of limbs. Krystle's mouth is open, but she is very pale. \"I was really scared,\" McWatters testified, \"and I remember screaming for someone to help us. Everybody was screaming, everybody was screaming for help. It seemed like a long time before help got to us, but it probably wasn't.\" By the time first responders reached Krystle, it was too late.  \"They were doing CPR on Krystle and I started to think she didn't make it,\" McWatters said. She grabbed her friend's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket. By the time she arrived at the hospital, shock had set in. She was confused. For a while, that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was Krystle Campbell. When Krystle's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she wasn't their daughter, they were heartbroken, McWatters said. Krystle's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents. Two days later, doctors told her they were taking her leg. Her body was broken, and it hurt like crazy, she said. But not as much as losing her friend. Campbell's death was the first to be described in detail at Tsarnaev's trial. But descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will come soon. There were runners conquering a 26.2-mile feat nearby, but Noah's attention was elsewhere, playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist. The 5-year-old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks, his mother, Rebekah Gregory, told jurors. Gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that Noah was happy playing scientist. The next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back. Other witnesses used similar phrases: Blown through the air, deafening explosion, cries for help. Shane O'Hara, the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store near where the bombs went off, said it sounded like a loud cannon, followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows. O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair. The decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him, he said. There were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors' questions. He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the courtroom. He told the jury the plea he heard: \"Stay with me, stay with me.\" Outside, Gregory tried to sit up, but could not rise much. \"My first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby, where was my son,\" Gregory said. She couldn't see her legs, but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk, she testified. \"At that point I thought that was the day I would die,\" she said.

A baby died from meningitis after the on-call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was \u2018very busy\u2019, an inquest heard. Leo Radcliffe\u2019s mother had rung NHS Direct after the five-month-old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing. A call handler from the privately run Go-To-Doc scheme passed the call to duty GP Dr Jason Tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi. Instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address, however, he left two voicemail messages on Leo\u2019s mother\u2019s mobile phone asking her to contact him. When she failed to answer, he assumed the family were asleep and that Leo was OK, made a \u2018likely diagnosis\u2019 of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was \u2018not necessary\u2019, the hearing was told. But four hours later, Leo developed a tell-tale rash on his forehead, and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital. After being challenged over what happened, Dr Tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived. He even described the street and area, claiming it was \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018scruffy\u2019 before coming clean. His mother, Katie Corry, now 23, told the hearing in Manchester that in the hours before he died in June 2010, Leo had become unsettled and started making a \u2018whimpering noise\u2019 while out in his pram. Back at their home in Chadderton, Oldham, he refused food, and she and Leo\u2019s father Kaine Radcliffe, 25, a labourer, noticed a rise in his temperature. She gave him baby paracetamol, but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily, although there was no sign of a rash. Shortly before midnight she rang the NHS Direct helpline, which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service, and then told a health adviser from Go-To-Doc about Leo\u2019s condition. Miss Corry said Leo felt \u2018really, really hot, like boiling hot\u2019. His case was referred to the on-call doctor with the message in capital letters: \u2018NO MONEY NO TRANSPORT, VISIT.\u2019 Scroll down for video. 'Lies': Dr Jason Tahghighi, right outside court yesterday, said that he had been to the family home and that he hadn't knocked because the lights were off, it was heard. Left, Leo's parents Katie Corry and Kaine Radcliffe. Leo\u2019s exhausted parents then fell asleep, and when Miss Corry woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails. \u2018Leo was beside me and I saw a purple rash on his forehead,\u2019 she said. \u2018I got a glass and put it on the rash because I knew it was meningitis.\u2019 Symptoms: Leo Radcliffe, pictured, had been suffering a high temperature and heavy breathing. Her partner called an ambulance but Leo died later that day at Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital. His family has since received an apology from Go-To-Doc. Dr Tahghighi, 47, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. His first voicemail message said: \u2018We are very busy with visits. Maybe he can wait until the morning.\u2019 The second said: \u2018As you haven\u2019t called back I\u2019m assuming that your son Leo is doing OK and settled down. I would suggest a follow-up with your GP some time during open hours. However, I would like you to phone us back with any concerns.\u2019 Dr Tahghighi said that at the time he had been working an \u2018excessive number of shifts\u2019, including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in Bramhall and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am. When asked if he had been \u2018too busy\u2019 to see Leo, he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know the reason I didn\u2019t visit. I had the four visits come in at once. \u2018I felt with no call back, I just assumed that everything was fine and settled. I should have attended but I was under a considerable amount of stress at the time. I admit working an excessive number of hours.\u2019 The inquest continues.

Apparently the firm found out Henderson was in a bad car crash and a Cosco car seat saved her child\u2019s life. Managers from the business then came up with a way to support her musical endeavors. Tiny Hearts was released in January and it jumped to number 53 in the charts. An accompanying music video captured Henderson in action with her children and singing at a recording studio. Candid footage also showed her getting a makeover with a stylist and make-up artist injecting some added star appeal. Henderson says getting rejected from American Idol will not stop her from doing what she loves. Rock-a-bye-baby: Henderson seen in her original DIY music video which went viral last December.

They just said, \"You have a really unique voice, we think you\u2019re good, but it\u2019s just not your time yet.\" 'So I\u2019m guessing maybe now it\u2019s my time.' On a more personal level, Henderson hopes that fame might help her to reconnect her with her own mother, who disappeared from her life when she was 11 years old. 'I don't know where she is,' the singer told The Huffington Post, adding, 'But I keep thinking that maybe if she somehow sees my video or my new song, she'll come forward and try to reach out.' Henderson says her family are excited about her recent breakthrough.

When she found the ring on the marsupial's collar, however, she was speechless. Jordan Day, 23, proposed to Jessica Harrington, 22, on March 7 in Summit Township, near Jackson. Jordan Day, 23, proposed to his girlfriend Jessica Harrington, 22, with the help of a baby kangaroo on March 7 in Summit Township, Michigan. He hid the ring on the kangaroo's collar, which he made several references to before Harrington noticed. When she did, Day got down on one knee and she was left speechless. The couple have been together for five-and-a-half years, have a three-year-old son named Payton and have been talking about marriage for the last year. 'It kind of took my breath away,' Harrington told MLive about Day's surprise proposal. The couple plan to wed on October 31 of this year. In a video that captured the proposal, Day makes several references to the kangaroo's collar being too tight before Harrington spotted the ring. Saying the collar was to tight was simply a ruse to get Harrington to find the ring and there was no animal cruelty involved, according to the New York Daily News. 'You missed it like 20 times,' Day said after he got down on one knee. Harrington said yes and was visibly overwhelmed with emotion. Day and Harrington have been dating for five-and-a-half years and have a three-year-old son named Payton together. They've been talking about marriage for the last year, but Harrington didn't know when Day would get down on one knee. A friend of the couple is attempting to start a small zoo and recently came across the baby kangaroo, named Boomer. Harrington fell in love with the animal when she spend a few months in Australia when she was 13 years old and was touched by her fiance's special gesture. 'The fact that he used something so special to me from my past brought back a lot of happy memories and he used that for a day that will be one of the biggest days of our lives,' she said. To add another personal touch to the proposal, Day used some familiar stones in Harrington's engagement ring. 'He actually used a stone from my mom's old ring and a stone from his mom's old ring so that made it even more special than what it already was,' Harrington said.", "abstract": "Jordan Day, 23, proposed to his girlfriend Jessica Harrington, 22, with the help of a baby kangaroo on March 7 in Summit Township, Michigan.

{"article": "A guest at an 007-themed swingers' party drowned in a swimming pool after apparently downing most of a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. The 35-year-old man was one of about 30 pleasure-seekers at the 'James Bond meets Pussy Galore' event in a \u00a32.5million country mansion in the Home Counties. He is thought to have entered the pool naked with a woman he had met at the party before suddenly starting to thrash about in the water and then sinking to the bottom. Organiser\u00a0Janet Harrison (left) with \u00a0friend in an image from a website that promotes the swingers' parties. The sex party was reportedly 'just getting started' when a 35-year-old man drowned in the swimming pool of the \u00a33million gated property (pictured is a pool at the mansion) Detectives are investigating the 'unexplained' death and the 50ft covered pool has been sealed off while toxicology tests are carried out to check that the water is safe. The party was one of the regular swingers' events put on by retired management consultant Richard Stanley, 66, and his partner Janet Harrison, 58, at their eight-bedroom home in Radlett, Hertfordshire. The couple, who appeared in a Channel 4 series last year, say they do not run the sex parties as a business, but ask for contributions to their costs. The event on Friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel, a woman covered in gold paint inspired by Goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from The Man With The Golden Gun. The man got into difficulties in the water just after midnight. The death happened at a swingers party run by Richard Stanley and Janet Harrison, pictured in the Channel 4 documentary\u00a0Jon Richardson Grows Up. The owner of the house, who organised the sex party, said there were safety notices around the pool. 'The party was really only just getting started,' a guest told the Sun. 'I was in the garden when a naked couple walked into the heated pool. She was white and in her 30s or 40s, he was black. 'There is a steep incline in the pool, which is about 3m deep, and the guy went in deeper by himself and started whacking the water. I thought he was playing. 'After a while the woman screamed and I saw the guy lying on the bottom. His body looked like it was moving, but then I realised it was ripples in the water.' Revellers dragged the man out and performed CPR on him at the poolside, but he could not be revived and was pronounced dead at Watford General Hospital. The victim, who told other guests he was called Edmund, was not a regular at the parties. He is believed to be Nigerian and from north-west London. The woman who entered the pool with him, who was not well known by other guests, was left distraught. Mr Stanley said the victim had apparently'severely dented' a bottle of Jack Daniel's he brought with him before entering the pool. The group's website states that there are health and safety rules for using the large indoor swimming pool. The couple have been hosting sex parties at the mansion - which includes a dungeon - for 10 years. He added: 'I heard a shout and ran over. I dived in fully clothed, pausing only to take my iPhone out of my pocket. He was enormously heavy. Three of the guys pulled him out, with me pushing him from behind. They put him straight into the CPR position and tried to revive him. One of the guests was a qualified nurse. 'I got straight on to 999. The call operator gave very clear instructions, which I shouted to the team performing CPR. We kept doing that until the ambulance arrived. 'Then the police turned up \u2013 there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night. After interviewing various people, the inspector said to me, 'this is a non-suspicious death'. It may well be that he had a heart attack.' The mansion boasts a sex dungeon, a dance room with a pole and a sauna for the 'hot-blooded sexual Olympians' who attend the parties. Mr Stanley and his partner decided to go ahead with a planned Alice In Wonderland-themed party on Saturday night after receiving messages of support from their regular guests. The property features a converted attic which Mr Stanley calls the 'dungeon in the sky' The tragedy struck in the early hours of Saturday at the mansion (pictured) in Radlett, north of London. The mansion's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected. 'My first reaction was that having a party the following night was not going to be appropriate,' Mr Stanley said. 'But we had so many supportive emails and texts saying things like, 'the first thing you do if you fall off a horse is get back on it', and 'it was what he would have wanted'.

{"article": "The artist who painted Bill Clinton's portrait for the National Gallery claims that there's more to the painting than meets the eye. Pennsylvania artist Nelson Shanks said that he slipped a Monica Lewinsky reference into the full-body portrait because the scandal was something he could never get 'completely out of his mind'. The painter said that the reference to former President Clinton's affair with the former White House intern was in the shadows of the painting, in the form of her infamous blue dress. Presidential: The full-body painting of Bill Clinton debuted in the National Portrait Gallery in 2006 (pictured above). The painter of the portrait, Nelson Shanks, has said that the dark space under the mantle represents the scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky which cast a shadow over Clinton's time in office. Scandal: Circled on the left, there's a shadow under the mantle that's in the silhouette of a dress. The portrait caused a stir at the time it was debuted as well, because it as though Clinton is not wearing a wedding band. 'If you look at the left-hand side of it there's a mantle in the Oval Office and I put a shadow coming into the painting and it does two things,' Shanks told\u00a0Philly.com. Shadow: Lewinsky's infamous blue dress that she claimed held DNA evidence of their affair. He added: 'It actually literally represents a shadow from a blue dress that I had on a mannequin, that I had there while I was painting it, but not when he was there. 'It is also a bit of a metaphor in that it represents a shadow on the office he held, or on him.' Shanks, who's painted portraits of Princess Diana and Pope John Paul II, also said that Clinton was the'most famous liar of all time'. The portrait caused controversy when it first was revealed in 2006 because it looks like Clinton is not wearing a wedding band, according to the New York Daily News. And according to Shanks, the Clintons 'hate the portrait' and are 'putting a lot of pressure' on the National Portrait Gallery to remove it. But a spokeswoman for the gallery has denied those accusations. When the painting was first debuted in 2006, it seemed as though Bill Clinton was quite pleased. 'I think the painting really feels like Bill Clinton,' he said then, according to the Washington Post. 'It has - I would not call it swagger... What? An informality? A looseness, a relaxed nature.' Shanks's most famous works include Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Luciano Pavarotti. His works spanned political and religious leaders, musicians and composers, actors and more. Controversy: Shanks (right) claims that he could never get Bill Clinton's controversy with Monica Lewinsky (left) 'completely out of his mind', especially when he was creating the portrait. He is a realist whose keen observation skills can be seen in his paintings that have an acute sense of detail, with wrinkles on hands and creases in pants. In 2009 the artist was awarded the Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Portrait Society of America, while in 2011 he was voted an honorary member into the Russian Academy for his works of art. Shanks said because of the Lewinsky controversy, Clinton was the hardest person for him to paint. Lewinsky, who was 22 when she started interning at the White House claimed to have sexual relations with Clinton nine times between 1995 and 1997. Clinton initially swore under oath that he \u2018did not have sexual relations\u2019 with Lewinsky but later admitted that he had misled the American public. Clinton famously said he 'did not have sexual relations' with Lewinsky when she claimed they had had relations nine times between 1995 and 1997. Lewinsky revealed her relationship with the president involved oral sex but not sexual intercourse. She famously kept a blue dress which she claimed held DNA evidence of their affair. In late July, 1998, Monica had to turn a dress over to Kenneth Starr's investigators after signing an immunity agreement. A blood sample was taken from Clinton on August 3, and on August 17, the FBI reported its conclusion that Clinton was the source of the semen on the dress 'to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.' Clinton, however, was found not guilty and though he was impeached, he remained in office. And with speculations that Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, might launch her 2016 presidential bid in April, Bill Clinton could be back in office within two years.", "abstract": "The artist who painted Bill Clinton's portrait for the National Gallery, Nelson Shanks, claims that he slipped a Monica Lewinsky reference into the painting because the scandal was something he could never get 'completely out of his mind'.

The League One club received more than 120 applicants for the role which was vacated by Lee Johnson when he joined rivals Barnsley on February 25. They included the likes of ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso and one-time Chelsea defender Winston Bogarde. League One side Oldham Athletic handed caretaker manager Dean Holden the job for the rest of the season. Former AC Milan star and Palermo manager Gennaro Gattuso had also applied for the Oldham manager's job. However, New York-based chairman Simon Corney has decided to put his faith in former player Holden, 35, who has lost three and won one of his four matches in charge. In the 20 days that have passed since Johnson's departure, injury-hit Oldham have dropped from ninth to 15th place in the table while Barnsley, who won 3-1 at Boundary Park on Saturday, have gone from 16th to sixth and a play-off position. Former Oldham manager and current Sky Sports pundit Iain Dowie was the fans' favourite to replace Johnson however, no serious talks are understood to have been held with the ex-Crystal Palace boss. Iain Dowie, pictured during his time in charge of the Latics, was the fans' favourite for the job. Swinton-born Holden, a defender who played for a number of sides including Bolton, Peterborough and Walsall, will be in charge for Tuesday night's match against promotion-chasing MK Dons. He will be assisted by head of youth Tony Philliskirk and first-team defender Adam Lockwood. Holden expressed his delight at being offered the role. 'I'm delighted to accept the role manager of this fantastic football club until the end of the season,' he said. 'I'm also pleased Tony will be alongside me to add his experience and knowledge of the game as we progress forward. 'I now ask all supporters to get behind the club and players for the remaining 11 games of the season, including the game against MK Dons (Tuesday night). 'I firmly believe we have the capabilities of reaching the play-off places this season and with your support, which has been excellent all season, we feel we can reach our targets.' Holden, who played for Oldham from 2002 untill 2005, said he was 'delighted' to accept the role of manager. Chief executive Neil Joy added that the search for a permanent manager would continue 'away from the spotlight.' He added: 'Given the importance of the role, especially at this point in the club\u2019s history, it is essential that no stone is left unturned in ensuring that the board appoints the person whom we believe will give us the best chance of achieving our goal of bringing Championship football to the town.' Oldham currently lie eight points away from the relegation zone and seven points from the play-off positions. Manchester United legend Paul Scholes, who lives in the town and is a regular at matches, was approached about the possibility of taking the job. The 40-year-old, however, said the timing was not right although he did not rule out taking over at some point in the future. Oldham, founder members of the Premier League, have been in the third tier of English football since 1997.

Jenny Clark, from Bournemouth, Dorset, ballooned to a size 18 when she was pregnant with her son Mason and once he was born, decided to join a gym to lose the weight. When a gym instructor told Jenny, 36, that she looked very symmetrical and should consider bodybuilding, she tried pumping iron as a way to shift the baby-weight and found she was a natural at it. Mother's love: Four-year-old Mason is Jenny Clark's biggest fan and enjoys watching her compete. Flashback: Jenny before she lost the weight (left) and displaying her winning ways. In just 18 months, the new mother lost five stone in fat and built up her impressive muscles with gruelling weight and cardio sessions. Although she came last in the first weight-lifting competition she entered, Jenny didn't give up and after a few more disappointments she started winning. She qualified her for the International Bodybuilding and Fitness Association (IBFA) British Championships last year which she won and has now gone on to win the World Championships. Now Jenny weighs 10st 9lb and her body fat is down to just nine per cent. And her son Mason, now aged four, has become her biggest fan and loves going to'mummy's muscle shows'. Jenny shows off her bodybuilding prowess competing in the IBFA World Championships in Rome. Jenny piled on the pounds during pregnancy but began losing teh weight once she joined the gym. Jenny spends three hours a day training in the gym and is aiming to compete in the Miss Universe competition in Italy this summer. The mother-of-one said: 'I ate for three the whole time I was pregnant and I put on a lot of weight. 'I really struggled to lose the weight afterwards for about three years and I was really unhappy. 'Through exercise and diet I'd managed to lose a bit of weight. I was doing a gym class and I was the only one who turned up. 'My gym instructor must have been watching me more closely because it was just me and she said I was really symmetrical and had I ever tried bodybuilding.' Weigh to go: Mason tries lifting the weights for himself while mum Jenny trains. Young Mason loves nothing more than seeing his mother in action. Jenny, who is a tattoo artist, said her husband, Dominic, used to be a bodybuilder and encouraged her to give it a go. She said: 'We went along to a show and I decided I wanted to do it. 'In my first competition I came last out of five people in my category and I was absolutely mortified. 'I'd put in so much work and I was just gutted but I signed up for another competition two weeks later and came fourth out of five. Jenny's husband Dominic takes a closer look at his wife's bodybuilding trophy. In safe hands: Using to lifting heavy weights, Mason is as light as a feather by comparison. 'Doing that first competition I never imagined I would now be world champion. 'I like the way I look on stage. You have to learn how to pose properly so it shows your physique off to its best. 'Even when I'm not at competitions I still get a lot of positive comments about the way I look. 'I'm not as lean as I am during competitions, but I still have quite a bit of muscle definition.

Bone fragments and skeletal remains have been found in a rugged area of Petit Jean Mountain where the skull of missing Little Rock businessman John Glasgow was found earlier this week. The skull, found on Wednesday by hikers, was identified through dental records as being Glasgow, who was 45 when he disappeared in 2008. A search crew of 20, aided by dogs, had been dispatched on Thursday to the area where the remains were found, but the search was suspended due to poor weather on Sunday. The more remains that are found, the better the chance of determining the cause of death, state Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channel told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. 'We will rely on law enforcement to continue their investigation and search. As they discover additional human remains, they will be submitted to us to examine,' Channel said. The remains were found within a mile of where Glasgow's vehicle was last seen parked at the time of his disappearance. That mile, however, is 'as the crow flies' and includes lengthy, boulder-laden, steep trails, Butts said. When the recovery efforts resume on Monday, officials will begin more intensive searching that will include cadaver dogs and metal detectors. 'We even have an archaeologist that will be coming with the Arkansas State Police,' Butts said. Melinda Glasgow, the wife of contracting executive John Glasgow, pictured in 2008 just after her husband went missing. 'They will work to determine how far the remains have been distributed and what to look for after so many years have passed.' Glasgow, the chief financial officer of CDI Contractors LLC, was last seen leaving his Little Rock home on the morning of January 28, 2008. The firm, owned by Dillard's and the estate of co-founder Bill Clark, built or remodeled many of Dillard's 300-plus department stores and put up some of Arkansas' signature projects, including former President Bill Clinton's library and the headquarters of Heifer International. A cellphone trace had led investigators to the Petit Jean State Park, a mountaintop resort an hour from his home, but weeks of searching revealed no clues. Glasgow was legally declared dead in 2011. Judge H. Vann Smith wrote at the time that 'The circumstantial evidence of John's death is substantial. John has been missing for three years without any credible information surfacing in that period that would suggest he might be alive somewhere.' In that same year, a twice-convicted felon named Jonathan Brawner told his lawyer and the Little Rock Police Department that he knew where Glasgow's body was buried. Brawner said that he had been recruited by 'thugs from Malvern' to whom he owed money to help bury Glasgow in a bean field near England in Lonoke County.

And, while he is urging the dozen out-of-contract players at Rangers to concentrate on winning new deals, he made it very clear that he\u2019d like to stay on beyond the summer.

But look at quality of squad. They know we\u2019ve underperformed. There is enough quality in there to do better. \u2018Football can change so quickly. There is no magic pill for confidence, which has severely lacking. But sometimes a new voice can provide a spark. \u2018Their main aim should be turning things around. There are 12 boys out of contract, go win yourself a contract. McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those. \u2018Be there at end of season, going around a full Ibrox to cheers, rather than hurrying down tunnel being booed off.\u2019 McCall spoke to McDowall on Thursday and intends to make contact with former team-mate Ally McCoist, still technically on gardening leave from Rangers.

Murray eased past Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 in California to book a quarter-final match-up with Spain's Feliciano Lopez who edged past Japan's Kei Nishikori.

Murray plays a forehand on his way to a straight-sets victory against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. Murray (right) pictured alongside Tim Henman ahead of their first meeting in Basel in October 2005. Murray was made to work hard by Mannarino's aggressive ground strokes but the Frenchman was too inconsistent and Murray took full advantage. A double fault in Mannarino's first service game presented the world number four with a break point but Mannarino held his nerve on a high smash and sealed the game unscathed. The first break of the match arrived soon after but it was Mannarino who took it, as this time Murray's second serve went long to give his opponent a surprise 3-2 advantage. A superb forehand pass from Murray in the following game, however, seemed to jolt the Scot into life as he won the next three games in succession to lead 5-3. Mannarino continued to come on the offensive, pinning his opponent back with an aggressive forehand, but Murray was clinical on the counter-attack and sealed the first set in 45 minutes. The second began as tightly as the first as Mannarino halted Murray's momentum with two holds of serve and the world number 38 could have broken at 2-2 but squandered two break points. Mannarino allowed his frustration to get the better of him in the following game and a wild forehand wide gave Murray the decisive break and a 4-2 lead. With victory in sight, Murray showed no signs of letting up and another Mannarino unforced error at 5-3 allowed the Scot to convert a second match point and seal a convincing win.

Feliciano Lopez gives the Indian Wells crowd the thumbs up after beating Kei Nishikori to reach the last eight. Murray praised Mannarino after the match, admitting the 26-year-old had proven a difficult opponent. 'It was a very tough match, he's playing very well this year and he's got a very tricky game,' Murray told Sky Sports. 'He's a lefty but he has a very flat backhand and a short take-back on his forehand so it's hard to read. 'He moves well and he has good hands around the net - in both sets though he played one or two loose games which helped me and I stayed solid throughout. 'I was frustrated to get broken in the first set, I thought I started well but he came out firing.

{"article": "Iceland is known for its hot springs and Northern lights. But now, researchers have revealed it is also the chlamydia capital of Europe. While the Nordic countries has high rates of the sexually transmitted disease (STD), rates in the US are even more alarming. Since 1980, rates of chlamydia in the US have soared compared to Europe. And while the number of Americans with gonorrhoea has declined since 1980, the figure for the US still\u00a0eclipses rates of its European counterparts. Washington D.C., shown in the diagrams under its former name of the District of Columbia, had the most syphilis, HIV and gonorrhoea, while Kentucky was the state with the highest rates of hepatitis. Meanwhile,  Estonia tops the European scale for HIV rates, Russia sits in the top five for the most HPV, hepatitis B, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV. Researchers at onlinedoctor.superdrug.com used the latest data from the World Health Organisation and the US' Centres for Disease Centers Control and Prevention (CDC). They plotted maps and graphs of STD rates in Europe and the US, from 1980 to 2013. Here, they reveal the most STD-riddled countries... Researchers found a stark difference between the United States and Europe. Graphs, showing the difference between rates of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis in Europe (left) and the U.S. (right), show Europe has managed to keep the incidence of STDs relatively low. There was one spike for chlamydia in 2005 and increases in gonorrhoea and syphilis in the mid-1990s. Outside of that, there were no drastic increases in these STDs in Europe. What occurred with STD rates in the United States is more alarming, researchers said. gonorrhoea rates, which were soaring compared to incidences of the disease in Europe, declined drastically in this period. But the gonorrhoea in the US still eclipses rates  of its European counterparts. Worse yet is how much the US\u2019s chlamydia incidence has risen over the same period of time; rates are sky high compared with statistics across the sea. The table shows the top five countries in Europe with the highest rate per STD. Iceland may be known for it's natural beauty, but it also sits No. 1 on the top five for chlamydia, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infections in Europe. It is also in the top five for HPV.  Russia had the most top five placements on these not-so-flattering charts, showing up in five of the eight lists.\u00a0Moldova has the most herpes, while the UK tops the HPV chart. The table shows the top 5 US states by STD incidence. The District of Columbia - now known as Washington D.C. - \u00a0 is the place where HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhoea are diagnosed at the highest rates. Researchers said D.C.\u2019s own health officials have called its HIV rates 'higher than rates in West African nations'. They pointed out the District\u2019s massive rates of HIV and AIDS are linked to delays in treatment after diagnosis, a lack of testing, and misconceptions about susceptibility to HIV/AIDS. The map above highlights which STD had the most new diagnoses annually in a given country, averaged from 2000 to 2013. Certain STDs seem to rule certain regions. For example, among northern European and eastern countries, chlamydia was typically the disease with the most new cases. In Germany and Poland in central Europe, hepatitis C was the most frequently diagnosed STD. In southwest Europe, France, Spain, and Italy, there were more new HIV cases than any other STD. However, looking at rates per individual, new diagnoses of STDs \u2013 especially chlamydia \u2013 are still far less common in Europe than in the United States. The heat maps above show the changes over time in the  rates of new cases of chlamydia and gonorrhoea per individual across the US. Notably, Washington, D.C., requires its own scale, researchers said, due to its very high rate of STDs. Peak rates of gonorrhoea in the capital were more than three times higher than the peak rate among the other 50 states. The District\u2019s Department of Health acknowledges a struggle of epidemic proportions with chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and other STDs, as well as hepatitis and HIV. The US' Centres for Disease Control has attributed its success \u2013 and failure \u2013 in combating sexually transmitted diseases to education and access to healthcare.

{"article": "Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today. Almost one in three crimes is \u2018inappropriately\u2019 punished with a police caution or penalty notice, including some that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, such as rape, MPs say. Some 86,000 offences that could have gone before a Crown Court were dealt with out of court in the year to June 2014, they add. Revelation: Tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers, a report claims today. The Home Affairs Select Committee points to an \u2018alarming\u2019 rise of the caution culture \u2013 which grew and peaked under the Labour government \u2013 and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system. The committee\u2019s report concludes that too often, police used cautions as a \u2018time-saving tool\u2019 rather than the correct way of tackling an offence. In total, police issued 318,500 of the so-called out-of-court disposals, mostly for minor offences, in 2013-14, down from 660,965 in 2008. Despite ministers insisting cautions are \u2018inappropriate\u2019 for serious offences, 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said: \u2018The inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable. \u2018It is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases. \u2018We cannot allow the misuse of out-of-court disposals in serious cases to continue. The public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist.\u2019 Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the committee, said the 'inappropriate use of out-of-court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable. The committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a \u2018postcode lottery\u2019. In Gwent, 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice, compared with 26 per cent in West Yorkshire. At the peak, one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out-of-court disposals. By last year, it had fallen to fewer than one in 20. The report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy, allowing front-line officers to spend more time pounding the beat. Arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time, and charging someone takes five hours. But too many cautions were being handed out \u2018inappropriately\u2019, says the committee. The report welcomes reforms being introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning. Six types of out-of-court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation. Minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance. More serious offenders will be give a \u2018suspended prosecution\u2019, which means they must meet a set of conditions such as paying a fine and going on a rehabilitation course to avoid further punishment. Last year the Mail revealed that 90 rapists have received only a caution since the Coalition came to power. In total, police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail, including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary.", "abstract": "A report by the Home Affairs Select Committee claims that tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers.

Private Cheryl James was one of four soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at the base between 1995 and 2002. The 18-year-old recruit suffered a single gunshot wound to her head. An army investigation ruled that Pte James took her own life, while a coroner returned an open verdict just three weeks after her death.

She suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, with the bullet entering between her right eye and the bridge of her nose. Ballistics experts claim that it is highly unlikely that the bullet wound suffered by Pte James could have been self inflicted. Just five months before Pte James' death, Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex was discovered with five bullet wounds to his chest. The army maintained that Pte Benton took his own life in June 1995, despite ballistics evidence suggesting that only one of the five rounds was discharged at close range.

Burke will teach the man, identified only as Sean from London, some dance moves ahead of a 'party of a lifetime' which has been planned in his honor following an online campaign to track him down. The epic party will be thrown at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which has a capacity of 93,000 people, later this year. The list of superstar performers who have offered their services keeps getting bigger. Pharrell Williams, Moby, Ellie Goulding, Andrew W.K., DJ Tommie Sunshine and dance duo Knife Party have all lent their support to Sean known affectionately as Dancing Man. Professional dancer Burke, who competed on ABC's Dancing with the Stars for 18 seasons, tweeted: '@DancingManFound heard ur amazing story! Would love to dance w/u & give dance tips.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Expertise: Cheryl Burke, with\u00a0Antonio Sab\u00e0to Jr, in her last series on Dancing with the Stars. She has offered to help with Sean's choreography. Star power: Ellie Goulding says she wants to take party in the party for Sean from London, the Dancing Man. Superstars: Some of the biggest names in music including Pharrell Williams (left) and Moby (right) have Tweeted to say they will perform at the event. The star, who announced her departure from the prime time dance show in December last year, will make sure Sean can wow the crowds when he takes center stage at the event, which is expected to attract thousands of revelers. Cassandra Fairbanks, who spearheaded the #finddancingman campaign and is organizing the party, told Daily Mail Online that Sean is'very excited'. 'We have some big surprises for Sean, we're gonna make sure he has the time of his life,' she said. 'He will definitely be making an appearance on stage and Cheryl from Dancing with the Stars has reached out and offered to choreograph him which will be amazing. 'There's also a lot of big names who have offered to perform, the thing is out of control, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.' Fairbanks' campaign began when she saw Sean pictured in a photo on the 4chan site looking down in the dumps after apparently being made fun of. An anonymous poster wrote: 'Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.' The post was republished on photo site imgur and quickly picked up more than 2000 comments of support for the mystery man's moves. A GoFundMe account \u2014 intended to track down Sean and offer to fly him to L.A. - is at $38,000 and climbing. Organizers of that page say any money that doesn't go do the dance party will go to an anti-bullying campaign. Fairbanks said the original fat-shaming taunts about Sean were 'disgusting bullying', but she said he is now basking in internet love. 'There have been thousands and thousands of messages \u2013 it's just been an outpouring of support and love and kindness. 'Sean has been been amazing. He says he's been smiling and laughing all day and reading everybody's messages.' Fairbanks, 29, who is originally from Boston, Massachusetts, says she herself has been 'overwhelmed' by the flood of attention and isn't sure how many people will attend the party. Outraged: The post was later screenshot and posted on Imgur, where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users, including Cassandra Fairbanks (above), who said she was 'horrified' by its 'cruel' nature. Offer: Cheryl Burke will help the party atmosphere by tutoring Sean in his moves. Success! After launching a Twitter campaign, The Free Thought Project activist manage to locate Sean within hours.

Ms Fairbanks's group even issued a formal, blue-colored invitation to the dance party to Sean. Part of it read: 'We want to see you dance freely' It's him! At around the same time, Ms Fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the Dancing Man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next to the team mascot of London soccer club Arsenal. 'It's been a whirlwind, I'm having trouble keeping up,' she said. 'It's gone a little bit crazy, there's a lot of people who want to get involved. 'It's really hard to say how many people are coming because I feel really swamped. 'Right now I have over 15,000 messages that I haven't been able to respond to.

{"article": "While scientists have theories about how fish first crawled onto land and breathed air, it's a mystery as to how vertebrates evolved tongues instead of feeding using suction. But now, a slow-motion video of mudskippers eating shrimp may help reveal the evolutionary secret. It shows the creatures, which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground, taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue, allowing them to swallow food on land. Scroll down for video. A slow-motion video of mudskippers feeding may help reveal an evolutionary secret. It shows the creatures, which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground (pictured in a stock image) taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue, allowing them to swallow food on land. Experts believe the finding may shed light on how terrestrial tetrapods - four-legged vertebrates - with tongues evolved from fish between 400 and 250 million years ago. When underwater, mudskippers suck water containing food particles into their mouths, which are swallowed when they reach the back of their throats, New Scientist reported. However, this method doesn\u2019t work on land, so terrestrial vertebrates evolved tongues to move the food to the back of the throat. A team of researchers led by Krijn Michel at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, captured slow-motion X-ray footage (shown) of Atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water. The video revealed that\u00a0mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish (stock image left) with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians such as nexts (right), meaning they could reveal a missing evolutionary link. Mudskippers are members of the gobies family, which is one of the largest fish families comprising more than 2,000 species. They are completely amphibious that can use their pectoral fins to walk on land. They appear to move in a series of'skips' and can use their muscular bodied to catapult themselves two feet (60cm) in the air. Mudskippers are uniquely adapted to intertidal habitats, meaning that they don't have to hide in rock pools or retreat when the tide goes out. They feed out of water and even fight to defend their territories. The creatures breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth and throat, but this only works when mudskippers are wet, limiting them to humid and watery habitats. Enlarged gill chambers enable them to retain a bubble of air and they close tightly when the animal is out of water to keep gills moist. A team of researchers led by Krijn Michel at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, captured slow-motion X-ray footage of Atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water. They found that it takes the gelatinous creatures less than half a second to pounce and eat. By watching the video, which was slowed down 50 times, the experts were able to see that the mudskippers carry water in their mouths. They spit it forward to grab the shrimp and then suck it back into their mouths quickly,to mimic the action of a tongue. The team also placed food on an absorbent surface and found that the mudskippers could still grab the food using their unusual technique, but had problems swallowing it. The scientists worked out that mudskippers move the hyoid bone in the floor of their mouth upwards, before they attempt to gulp down food. Their finding is reported in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences and is the opposite of what fish do underwater. However, it closely resembles the feeding habits of newts, which have tongues. This means that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians, so they could reveal a missing evolutionary link. Dr Michel said: \u2018This could be an in-between, from which a fleshy tongue could have evolved. \u2018This has never been considered a possibility, until now.", "abstract": "A slow-motion video of mudskippers eating shrimp may help reveal how terrestrial tetrapods evolved tongues from fish between 400 and 250 million years ago.

Magistrate Wendy Cull handed down the two-year prison sentence which is to be suspended after three months saying that the fraudulent behaviour was planned and systematic. 36-year-old Karma Elms has been sentenced to 2 years jail after stealing nearly $40,000 in overtime. The offence saw 36-year-old, Karma Elms scam the Health department out of $39,352 over 15 months. According to the Magistrate, Elms showed a 'degree of defensiveness' despite pleading guilty and made note of the fact that she had travel a long way to get to work. She has not yet repaid the debt and is on the brink of bankruptcy after spending all of the stolen funds on credit cards, rent and gift hampers. 'Clearly you are a poor manager of your personal finances and have spent money that far exceeded your income,' The ABC reported Magistrate Cull said. Elms was hired by Queensland health in 2010 to help with the large workload after the department's flawed payroll system was introduced that left 1800 employees with little or no pay. The Caboolture woman pleaded guilty to the charges and is still to repay the $39,352 as she has spent it all.

{"article": "Ruling: Mr Justice Mostyn said today a millionaire sperm donor\u00a0must pay \u00a320,000 to cover the legal costs of the lesbian couple in a row over access to the seven-year-old boy. The millionaire gay father of a child brought up by a lesbian couple he donated sperm to must pay \u00a320,000 to cover their costs in an extraordinary triangular legal battle between the boy's three parents. The man - named in High Court papers as JF - helped the women have a child in 2007 but the mothers now say he is being too demanding over access to the\u00a0seven-year-old. After the boy was born JF - who has dual British and US citizenship and lives in a \u00a31.2million pound home in the South of England - had irregular contact with him and took him to America twice. But his relationship broke down with the mothers, who complained that the father had become 'increasingly individualistic and demanding about contact', the court heard. Today Mr Justice Mostyn - one of Britain's most senior family judges - ruled that in the absence of legal aid JF must pay 80 per cent of the mothers' costs as they continue to fight him in court. The judge blamed the Government's 'grossly unfair' legal aid cuts that mean the father should have to pay \u00a320,596 now, and 80 per cent of future costs run up by the women, known as MG and JG. 'But that it where the Government has left him. It is a sorry state of affairs,' added the judge. The boy's mothers,  who live in the North of England and are known only as MG, now 35, and JG, now 45, met in in 2005 and entered a civil partnership in July 2006. They wanted a child and responded to an entry by JF in a register for 'lesbian women and gay men seeking a non-sexual parenting partner' and accepted his sperm so they could have a child. MG carried the baby and gave birth in April 2007 and the couple agreed that JG became a legal step-parent and it was agreed all three would have legal rights to the boy - JFG - who was registered as an American citizen. Until October 2012 JF enjoyed periodic contact with his son and had even taken him to America with the two mothers on a couple of occasions. Turned sour: The seven-year-old boy is now at the centre of a bitter and expensive legal battle between his parents. In December 2013 JF issued an application in the High Court for more regular contact with his son, sparking an ongoing legal battle with the lesbian couple, who have since split up and run out of money. During eight court hearings legal costs have built up and the mothers have extended their mortgage to pay for it. But with'modest means' they cannot afford any more. The judge said 'unfortunately' in April 2014 the two mothers separated but continue to work together in court. Under the old system both would have been entitled to legal aid, said the judge. But in April 2013 the Legal Aid, Sentence and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 ( LASPO) came into force. It removed legal aid from private law children proceedings and 'at a stroke, 63 years of state funding of cases such as this was swept away,' said the judge. Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'With the state washing its hands of MG and JG they now look to JF to fund their representation.' He said although the barristers in the case had reduced their fees they could not be expected to work for nothing. He added: 'So even though it cannot be said that JF has behaved reprehensibly or unreasonably he is the only realistic source of costs funding, subject to whatever contribution MG and JG should make from their own very limited resources. Some may say (and have said) that this is grossly unjust; I myself refrain from comment.' He said: 'Even though MG and JG are certainly not entitled to an order for costs they are entitled to seek an order for costs funding. To JF that may seem (with reason) to be a specious distinction without a difference, but that is where we find ourselves, now that the fourth pillar of the welfare state has been largely demolished.' Now the father must pay more than \u00a320,000 to the women the High Court battle will continue, with a ruling over access now likely later this year. An Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless. At the time legal aid reform began not only had this Government inherited an unprecedented financial crisis but our legal aid bill was one of the most expensive in the world at around \u00a32billion a year. 'We want to make sure family cases happen in the least divisive way possible, which is why we encourage people to use mediation and other out of court options that we know are less stressful and confrontational than going to court - and as a result are often more successful.

Nine Chelsea stars - including captain Terry - surrounded the referee to successfully get Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off for a lunge on Oscar in their Champions League defeat. But Terry has attempted to excuse the players' behaviour and insisted it was simply retaliation for PSG's antics. Chelsea's players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (second right) in the first half of the Blues' defeat. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge in the second leg clash. The referee is almost completely hidden from view as the Chelsea players make their case as they gained an early advantage. He said: 'If I have to run 20, 30 yards, it doesn't look great but when you're standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref, for me I think I support my team-mates. 'And once I go, four or five go with me. It doesn't look good at all but that's part of the game. We'll match it if people want to mix it, that's part of our game as well. 'There was an awful lot going on but \u200eI don't think anyone got caught up in it. 'Once they're charging the ref, the only thing we can do is respond. You can't as a group of players let them surround the ref, trying to get our players booked.' Ibrahimovic's challenge on Chelsea midfielder Oscar which earned the striker a red card many perceived to be harsh. Ibrahimovic holds his hands up after the challenge as the Chelsea players begin their protests which later drew criticism. Chelsea striker Diego Costa makes a beeline for Ibrahimovic as the referee raises the red card to send the Swede for an early bath. Terry also hit back at critics who accused Chelsea players of behaving badly as they crashed out of the Champions League. Ibrahimovic branded them 'babies' for their reaction to his tackle on Oscar which persuaded Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers to send him off half an hour into the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. On TV, Jamie Carragher called the pressure they put on the officials 'disgraceful' and said it came from manager Jose Mourinho, while Graeme Souness said Oscar's play acting was 'pathetic'. 'Coming from them?', was Terry's initial response. The Chelsea captain added: 'I don't want to get involved in a row but as a group it's difficult. It's there and you have to stick up for your team-mates. 'The fans want to see that and that's the same with every side. Every other side is as bad as each other. It's part of the game. It's maybe an excuse they're looking for but certainly not from our point.' It made for a disappointing night for Mourinho's players, dumped out on away goals despite leading twice and left to focus on the title race.

Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said the pressure Chelsea put on the referee was 'disgraceful' Carragher, Thierry Henry (centre) and Graeme Souness disect Chelsea's exit from the Champions League on Sky Sports. Terry said: 'We have to pick ourselves up and go again at the weekend now. We've got another big game against a very good Southampton side. 'We've got the Capital One Cup in the pocket and the Premier League is a massive one to go for. We're a few points clear and we need to keep that gap and maintain it. We can only do that by responding and doing that the right way and coming back here and picking up three points. 'The manager said then if we can win the Capital One Cup and the Premier League, it will be a very successful year. There is an awful lot to do but it's in our hands and we have to respond. We've got four or five days until Sunday's game. '[We will have a] couple of days warm down, train and then pick ourselves right back up. As a group of players, there's enough experience in the squad to rally round and get everyone going again.' There will be no English teams in the last eight of the Champions League unless Arsenal or Manchester City can overturn first leg defeats next week in Monaco and Barcelona respectively. Terry said: 'We've had our fair share of maintaining interest for English sides in the competition over the years. It's disappointing to go out early. It's different for us, we're normally in the hat for the next round for sure but from the club's point a view and the players and the fans, we're obviously really disappointed.

Many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years. It\u2019s a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity. So when Chelsea surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off on Wednesday it wasn\u2019t something new, or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us. It has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game. It\u2019s been a part of English football for years. Having said that, now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way, as I believe Chelsea did on Wednesday and I think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules. Almost all the Chelsea squad surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers after an incident at Stamford Bridge. If a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. So on Wednesday night, he could still have sent off Ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but Chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick. It wouldn\u2019t immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction. Behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players. At the moment, it\u2019s worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision, so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so. However, if you felt that by hounding the referee, your team might lose a potential goal-scoring opportunity, because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box, managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint. And over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly. Imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee. The manager would be furious. Referees are only human. Kuipers might have looked at the Ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50-50 decision. But when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too, all of that activity around him might make him feel it\u2019s a 90 per cent decision. This tackle from PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from Chelsea players. The Chelsea players surround referee\u00a0Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge as he brandishes the red card. Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half. This would only be a small change in the rules but I believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time. Certainly managers wouldn\u2019t encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team. It gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive. You could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card, trying to get an opponent booked or sent off. That would soon end what is an unsavoury practice. Another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner, forcing the referee to back off. It\u2019s natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high. But what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players won\u2019t encroach. If someone is to complain, they can do so backing away from the referee, getting into position, not moving towards him. And if someone does need to go to referee, it should only be the captain. And when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge. Football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle. I\u2019ve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it\u2019s directed in the right way. But referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct. It\u2019s important to draw a line and clearly state what is and isn\u2019t acceptable. WHEN FRIDAY COMES, ENGLISH TEAMS CAN FEEL BENEFIT IN EUROPE. It has been an awful few weeks for English teams in Europe with only Everton thriving in the Europa League. Given the competitiveness of the Premier League you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the Champions League and Europa League, when the competitions step up a level. But the reverse seems to happening. The sheer competitiveness of the Premier League is leaving us short in these difficult games.

{"article": "Hidden patterns of climate change have been revealed by scientists using a method more normally used to diagnose heart disease. The scientists used multiscale entropy analysis to measure the 'pulse of the planet' in an attempt to look for subtle changes in temperature on Earth. The technique is normally used by surgeons to detect irregular heartbeats in large amounts of data from echocardiograms. The graph above shows how the entropy - or predictability - of Central European air temperatures have become less predictable over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months. The black lines shows the temperature predictability between 1850 to 1960 while the red lines shows the entropy between 1961 and 2014. Researchers at the University of Leicester, however, have used it to look at the variability in the temperature in Europe. They found that the climate appears to have become less regular recently when temperatures are examined on times-scales of longer than 12 months. The chances of heatwaves in Europe have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures, experts have said. Extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade, a study from the Met Office found last year. The chances of extreme heatwaves, such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across Europe, have also increased tenfold, from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century. By the 2040s, such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, according to the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year. It found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity, such as burning fossil fuels. Despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s, the new study found summer temperatures in central and Mediterranean Europe affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by 0.81\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013. They say this may be a sign that the regional temperatures are being influenced by more complex feedback systems and may explain why extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods and cold spells are happening more irregularly. Professor Heiko Balzter, a climate scientist at the University of Leicester who led the study, said: 'I had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data. 'It has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease, because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time-series data. 'We are literally taking the pulse of the planet. 'Interestingly, the changes we found only operated on time-scales longer than about a year. 'On these time-scales the climate seems to have become less predictable.' Multiscale entropy analysis works by searching data for small patterns of information that appear repeatedly. It many of these chunks are found then the data has low entropy and high regularity. If few are found then the system is harder to predict. The research team, shoe work is published in the journal Climate, used this approach to analyse the Central European variance-adjusted mean monthly air temperature anomalies. They found that air temperatures between 1961 and 2014 have become less predictable than between 1850 and 1960 over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months. Professor Balzter said: 'Evidence is mounting that the temporal dynamics of the climate system are changing at the same time as the average global temperature is increasing due to multiple climate forcings. Heatwaves, like the one above hitting Brighton Beach, have become harder to predict because temperatures patterns across Europe have become more irregular, according to the new research by climate scientists. This map of central Europe shows where entropy has increased (blue) and where it has decreased (red) This map of central Europe shows where the temperature data had the greatest change in entropy, as shown by the colours where yellow is the greatest change and hardest to predict while white is an entropy change of zero. 'A large number of extreme weather events such as prolonged cold spells, heatwaves, droughts and floods have been recorded around the world in the past 10 years. 'Such changes in the temporal scaling behaviour of climate time-series data can be difficult to detect. 'It is possible that climate system feedbacks are expressed in altered temporal scales of the European temperature time-series data.'", "abstract": "Scientists have used multiscale entropy analysis, a method used to diagnose heart disease, to reveal hidden patterns of climate change.

{"article": "Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed suddenly at White Hart Lane in scenes reminiscent of Fabrice Muamba\u2019s near-fatal cardiac arrest in March 2012. With no one near him, the Swansea star appeared to lose consciousness in the centre circle, slumping to the floor, moments after Nacer Chadli had given Tottenham a 1-0 lead. Both sets of medical staff came rushing onto the pitch to care for the stricken Frenchman as the two groups of players looked on in despair. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham. Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness. Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff. Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane. Gomis was treated for five minutes before being stretchered off holding an oxygen mask to his mouth, although he appeared to be conscious as he left the field. The striker, who suffers from vasovagal \u2014 a medical condition that can lead to fainting \u2014 was taken straight to the White Hart Lane medical room where he was given more treatment. However, good news emerged from Swansea at half-time that Gomis was fine and had not been hospitalised. \u2018He is fine,\u2019 said a Swansea spokesperson. \u2018He is in the medical room.It is something we have been aware of \u2014 it is something called a vasovagal condition. We have always been aware of it and it has happened before. He has had all the medical and cardiology tests with us.\u2019 The condition occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as physical or emotional distress. This can then cause a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, which reduces the blood flow to the brain. A brief loss of consciousness can follow. The French striker later tweeted in French and then English, saying: 'I Wanted to reassure you concerning my Health, it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now. 'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France. 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order. 'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get Well messages.' Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher. Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game. In the early moments of the second half, Swansea also confirmed on their official Twitter account that Gomis had improved. The striker has a history of losing consciousness, fainting three times in the space of three months after joining Lyon in 2009. One of those episodes occurred while training with the France national squad in October 2009. After reportedly losing consciousness for six minutes, he re-joined the session 15 minutes later. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said at the time: \u2018We can\u2019t not be worried, it scares you each time. A vasovagal episode (fainting) is part of the things that can happen to people who have this type of constitution. It\u2019s now three times that it\u2019s happened. Yes, I\u2019m worried.\u2019 A stunned silence came over White Hart Lane as the incident unfolded last night, no doubt re-kindling memories of Muamba\u2019s cardiac arrest which occurred nearly three years ago to the day and almost on the same spot on the White Hart Lane pitc. On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham. The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist\u00a0Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch. Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned. Medical staff rush to Fabrice Muamba's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012. Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance. Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football. Former players immediately took to Twitter to express their shock and wish Gomis a speedy recovery.

Rochae Davis says she was walking with friends in Croydon, south London, with the comb tucked into the waistband of her trousers. Police already on their way to the scene were alerted to CCTV footage which they say purported to show the 15-year-old carrying a gun and later arrested her at home. Rochae Davis, 15, pictured with her mother Simone, says she was arrested by armed police because they mistook an afro-comb tucked into her waistband for a gun. She was bailed without charge and must return to a police station in April as the investigation continues. But, with police yet to recover a weapon, the schoolgirl claims she was only arrested because police jumped to conclusions. 'As I was walking back with a friend, six police officers from Trident, the gun crime unit arrived, and had guns. They pushed us against a wall and searched us,' she said. 'It was only after they had finished that they said they had seen me on CCTV with a firearm. But it was an afro comb - it didn't look anything like a gun. 'I was scared and confused. I said I didn't have a gun, but it was so unfair, they wouldn't hear me out. 'I didn't know what was happening. They took my clothes and my stuff - it was really uncomfortable.' Rochae's mother, Simone, said police's treatment of her daughter had been 'a disgrace' and that the schoolgirl had 'never been in trouble' with the law before. The schoolgirl said she 'didn't know what was happening' when she was taken to a police station and held overnight. Officers did not find the comb (above) when they searched her house as, she says, she had given it back to a friend. Rochae was bailed without charge but must return to a police station next month. A police spokesman said inquiries were ongoing. 'If they thought they saw her with a gun on CCTV then why didn't they stop and search her there and then,' the 33-year-old said. She added police may have thought Rochae was a young boy because she had her hood up at the time. The six-inch afro comb, which has a black handle and metal prongs, belonged to the teenager's friend, she said. Police did not find it when searching the family's home on the night of her arrest with Rochae claiming she had already given it back to a friend. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'As officers were responding, police were contacted by the local authority CCTV control room, which was also monitoring the incident, with information that a female had been seen with what was believed to be a firearm in the area. 'Police arrived and a number of people were dispersed.

{"article": "(CNN)Israel's ruling Likud Party pulled off a victory in Tuesday's election -- and it was a stunning one. During the campaign, incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum, for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the White House, to his fixation on the Iran nuclear issue, to allegations over Netanyahu's household expenses. Yet despite this unpromising backdrop, Likud is on course to win 30 seats in the Knesset, six seats more than the main opposition Zionist Union -- headed by Isaac Herzog and Tsipi Livni, and an obvious favorite of the Israeli media establishment and Europe, Washington, and the West Bank. The blow to the Zionist Union is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading Likud as the campaign drew to a close. (Likud wasn't the only winner of the night --the new center-right party Kulanu (All of Us), which focuses on the economy, also had a good showing, securing 10 seats). Still, Likud's resounding hasn't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks, the work of negotiating a coalition will begin. With this in mind, there is a good chance that President Reuven Rivlin will ask Netanyahu to form a national unity government, either with the Zionist Union, or as the head of a right-wing coalition (although the bitter rivalry between Herzog/Livni and Netanyahu during the campaign makes the latter more likely). Overall, the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate, with even voters who self-identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the Palestinian issue and broader questions of national security. Meanwhile, the numbers for the left in Tuesday's election -- a four seats for Meretz, 24 for the Zionist Union and 14 for the Arab List suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition. As a result, the international community and the Palestinian leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the Palestinian state will be conducted with the center-right. So, what can we expect from the new Netanyahu government? Issues that dominated the campaign, namely security and the economy, will likely dominate. For a start, Netanyahu will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform.  The issue of housing  requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the Israel Land Authority and planning and zoning processes. But to address these Issues properly, Netanyahu will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors, meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term. In addition, Netanyahu will also have to repair the fractured relationship with Washington, something that may not be easy given that ties with the Obama administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over Iran is reached, and what shape such a deal takes. That raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security, and on this, the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo. This is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that Israel should instead move beyond a short-term approach and toward building a long-term, comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power. Making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rather than merely kicking the can down the road. Restarting communication with the West Bank leadership and properly engaging with the Arab Peace Initiative would be steps in the right direction. All that said, this will be Netanyahu's fourth term in office, and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory. And that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long-tern national security strategy. Those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again.", "abstract": "Despite criticism from across the political spectrum, Israel's ruling Likud Party, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, won a stunning victory in Tuesday's election, securing 30 seats in the Knesset.

Baths were also on the decline with more people opting for a quick shower over a long soak, according to a new report. Despite falling sales of the traditional bar of soap, people are actually washing more with over a third of adults are washing their hands more often than they were a year ago. The proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014. Experts believe the nation's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over international health scares such as last year's Ebola outbreak. Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel, said: 'With health scares making headlines around the world throughout 2014, the spread of disease has raised awareness of how hand hygiene plays a part in preventing infection, causing an increase in the frequency of consumers washing their hands.' Professor Vincent-Wayne Mitchell, a consumer marketing specialist at the Cass Business School in London, added that years of MRSA oubreaks and food hygiene scares had made people 'hygiene hyperconscious.' The proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014. Research by Mintel found that 87 per cent of people are more likely to purchase liquid soap than bar soap, 71 per cent. More than half of us also use hand sanitiser gel, with a third buying it once a month or more. Professor Isabelle Szmigin, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Birmingham, said the shift to liquid soap was 'purely an improvement' 'The large majority of young Brits purchasing hand sanitiser shows that, despite preconceptions, this group have a particularly cautious attitude towards spreading germs,' added Ms Libby. Humans have been using soap for thousands of years. The earliest bar discovered dates back to around 2800 BC in ancient Babylon. The first mass-market transparent soap was Pears, which was first sold in 1807. Professor Isabelle Szmigin, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Birmingham, said the shift to liquid soap was 'purely an improvement'. 'This is what we call a continuous innovation, where the basic formula is the same but the product is better,' she said. Shower washes were the most frequently purchased body cleansing product of 2014, as they were the previous year, with one in five taking less baths than they did a year ago. Ms Libby said: 'Consumers have started to realise that being environmentally friendly can translate to money-saving and are making greener choices to benefit their own pockets.' Experts believe the nation's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over health scares such as last year's Ebola outbreak. Young men, aged 16-24, were the most likely to still choose a bath over a shower\u00a0with a quarter claiming that the bath is their cleaning method of choice, compared to the national average of 19 per cent. One in five men young men said they are taking more baths compared to three years ago with a quarter of describing the bathroom as their'sanctuary.' Prof Mitchell said the increasing use of baths by young men reflects the rise of male grooming and the metrosexual phenomenon. 'Young men can prove an important target for innovation in the soap, bath and shower sector, and could be encouraged into habits that they maintain as they age,' Ms Libby concluded. The soap, bath and shower category experienced declining sales over the past two years, falling from \u00a3660 million in 2012 to an estimated \u00a3638 million in 2014.", "abstract": "Sales of traditional bar soap are declining as more people opt for liquid hand wash and hand sanitiser, according to a report by Mintel. The report also found that baths are on the decline, with more people opting for a quick shower over a long soak. Despite this, people are washing more, with over a third of adults washing their hands more often than they were a year ago, possibly due to public fear over international health scares such as the Ebola outbreak."}

Medical experts are assessing what to do next, including whether or not the evacuate the infected individual to the United Kingdom for treatment, according to a Public Health England spokesperson.

The Senegal international has stated he is content with life at Bordeaux but has aspirations to play in England.

{"article": "They stood alongside each other, peering anxiously towards The Kop. As a sea of red and white jerseys jostled and pointed fingers, Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton never blinked. Then, as referee Martin Atkinson restored order, Ferguson cracked. Turning to see who was on the row behind him in Anfield\u2019s Directors Box, Ferguson could not help himself. Suddenly he was beaming, his smile born of elation and contentment: victory had been confirmed. Winning at Anfield mattered more to Ferguson than anything else when he shaped Manchester United\u2019s destiny and retirement hasn\u2019t dulled the desire. That smile and subsequent tap on Charlton\u2019s shoulder, told you everything about how he was feeling. Sir Alex Ferguson looked delighted by Manchester United's victory over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Sir Alex Ferguson acknowledges United supporters upon his arrival for the game against Liverpool. Sir Bobby Charlton (centre) and Ed Woodward (left) were also at Anfield to see United win. Ferguson takes his seat at Anfield before United's game against Liverpool in the Premier League. Mind you, he wasn\u2019t alone. Crammed into the Anfield Road end, 3,000 United fans were exultant, noisily acclaiming the finest performance of the Louis Van Gaal era: their team had not played with such panache and arrogance here since the mid-1990s. They were going to enjoy this. \u2018We played them off the pitch in the first half, I think,\u2019 Van Gaal mused afterwards. \u2018It was the best 45 minutes (of the season). We scored a fantastic goal, we gave nothing away. It really was a superb first half. In the dressing room, I gave the players all my compliments.\u2019 Van Gaal might have been less than impressed by what he in the second half but do not doubt how much satisfaction this win provided. As he walked out of Anfield later to catch the team bus, he stopped and took look around the famous old stadium. His contentment was beyond question. As well it might have been. This was the afternoon when the Van Gaal masterplan started to come together. For all the Liverpool had shortcomings, the simple truth was that they couldn\u2019t get near United and were lucky that only one goal separated them at the break. All over the pitch, United players stood out like beacons. Phil Jones, for starters, was terrific in the centre of defence, keeping Daniel Sturridge under wraps for much of the game; Antonio Valencia personified diligence at right back. It was in midfield, however, were United stamped their class. Maroune Fellaini dominated, setting an aggressive tone; Daley Blind was impressively solid while Ander Herrara passed the ball with purpose and precision, most devastatingly when he set Juan Mata free for the opening goal.

Mata (left) applauds the United supporters at Anfield after securing the three points over Liverpool. Ander Herrera provided a sublime assist for Mata's opener for United in the 14th minute at Anfield. Ah, Mata. For large parts of the 15 months he has been at Old Traffford, you have wondered why they spent \u00a337million on him \u2013 then you see how he played here, like when scoring that glorious second, and can understand why Michael Carrick called Mata \u201cLittle Magician\u201d. Ed Woodward, for one, was certainly impressed after he had exchanged passes with Angel Di Maria and capped the move with a bicycle kick that arrowed past Simon Mignolet. \u2018What a goal!\u2019 Woodward exclaimed, as he gave Charlton a hug. Mata, by contrast, was slightly more circumspect. \u2018In the last few months I\u2019ve not had the best moments but I am the same player that I was when I came to England,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have the same passion, the same illusion, but it is the manager who decides. But obviously I\u2019m happy because we played well in a very difficult game.\u2019 Much has been spoken about United this year, largely about how they are a pale shadow compared to what has gone before. In some respects that is absolutely right: how many of this starting line-up would have got into the treble winning side of 1999? Probably only Wayne Rooney. But time moves on and the 2014-15 squad are beginning to move in the right direction and what has been most impressive is the reaction they have produced since that chastening night against Arsenal two weeks ago when they were bounced out of the FA Cup. A 3-0 demolition of Tottenham Hotspur followed by a win against their most bitter rivals has made fourth place United\u2019s to lose and that will ensure Van Gaal has achieved the objective that he was set by Ed Woodward when arriving last summer", "abstract": "Manchester United's victory over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday was a moment of elation and contentment for Sir Alex Ferguson, who was delighted by the win.

Propaganda: Smiling children enjoy fairground rides at Dijla City in Islamic State's most recent propaganda video. The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate. The scenes could be from any park, anywhere in the world, but these children live under the control of ISIS. The video, entitled 'Citizens\u2019 Days Out in the Shadow of the Islamic State' and published today, is an attempt to depict an idealised version of everyday life under the caliphate. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, analysed the footage. 'In the video, we see men and children playing in Dijla City theme park, which is located just on the outside of Mosul in northern Iraq,' Mr Winter said.

Mother-of-four Karen was fed up of trying to make her limp hair look and feel thicker. Like many busy women, she had found her hair had thinned, thanks to hormonal changes, but this can also be caused by stress, a poor diet or illness. BEFORE: Mother-of-four Karen (pictured) is fed-up with trying to make her long, limp hair look thicker. While Karen had used clip-in hair extensions in the past, and found that they worked well, she wanted a longer-lasting solution. The most important thing with hair extensions is that they look natural. It\u2019s equally important that they don\u2019t damage your real hair or prevent it from growing.

With 46 shades to choose from, it was easy to match them to Karen\u2019s hair colour. The strips of hair have a bonded keratin tip, which is attached to your hair. The keratin is transparent, which means that the joins are barely visible. Chanelle blended four different shades into Karen\u2019s hair to create a natural look. Then, she cut them, so that they blended in with Karen\u2019s natural hair. AFTER: Karen (pictured) had\u00a0semi-permanent hair extensions put in at\u00a0the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, they should last six months. The finished result promises to last six months. The keratin bond can withstand washing, drying and brushing \u2014 however, good aftercare is essential.

Retired Chris Carr, 62, from Melksham, Wiltshire, was visiting Benidorm as part of a four-month caravan trip with his wife Sally, 59, when he was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains. Spanish doctors found he is suffering from a diaphragmatic hernia which is causing a huge twist in his stomach, and said he needed an operation in the UK where he would get the necessary post-operative care. Chris Carr (pictured) was visiting Benidorm as part of a four-month caravan trip with his wife when he was rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains and told he needed an operation. But when his medical insurance company rang three hospitals near his home they were told there were no free beds. The couple's concerned friends rallied round and launched a campaign, putting pressure on the hospitals and getting support from their local MP. Mr Carr, who is still currently in Spain, has finally been offered a bed at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset, and is due to fly home tomorrow. But after 11 days of not knowing, Mrs Carr, a retired NHS midwife, said: 'I feel extremely angry - I was furious when we were told about there being no beds. Mr Carr was told by doctors he needed an operation in the UK where he would get post-operative care. Mr Carr's insurers phoned three hospitals near his home: Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital (pictured) and Swindon's Great Western Hospital - but all said there were no beds available for him. 'We've both worked hard all our lives and paid our taxes. 'Chris worked at the university for 35 years or more and I was a midwife for the NHS for 40 years. 'We've paid our taxes all this time and then for this to happen - I was so frustrated.' Speaking from Spain, she added: 'We had all the proper insurance - which isn't cheap - so it should have been seamless all the way through. 'But while the care here has been brilliant, it is back in the UK where there has been all the trouble.' He is suffering from a diaphragmatic hernia which is causing a huge and painful twist in his stomach. Former university IT worker Mr Carr travelled to Spain with his wife as part of a four-month group trip with the Camping and Caravanning Club in January. He began to feel unwell on February 14 after a meal out and after suffering extreme vomiting went to Hospital Marina Baixa, where he was diagnosed with food poisoning. He returned to his caravan with tablets but when his stomach swelled to four times its normal size he returned and was instantly seen by worried doctors. They diagnosed the hernia on his diaphragm which had caused his stomach to swell and twist, leaving him in agony. Doctors told the Carrs he needed an operation to remove part - if not all - of his stomach and due to potential left-over damage and the need for top-class post-operative care, the operation should happen in the UK. Mrs Carr said the insurers who work with the Camping and Caravanning Club phoned three hospitals near his home - Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bath's Royal United Hospital and Swindon's Great Western Hospital - but all said there were no beds free. 'We couldn't believe it,' said Mrs Carr. 'Bristol said no, Bath said no, Swindon said no. 'They said they had a duty of care to the patients they already had, and there were no beds anyway. We couldn't believe it. 'There was talk of just flying back and dumping ourselves in the nearest A and E, but we would effectively then be health tourists in our own country, and that didn't seem right.' When Mr Carr's insurance company rang hospitals near his home they were told there were no free beds. Friends and family launched the Get Chris Home campaign on Sunday, urging hospitals to change their mind and recruiting the support of Chippenham MP Duncan Hames. Yesterday Mrs Carr received a call from insurers to say Bath's RUH had now changed its mind and Mr Carr is due to fly home tomorrow via air ambulance for his operation. Mrs Carr said: 'It is thanks to the support of our friends and we are so relieved.' Speaking from his hospital bed in Benidorm today Mr Carr said he felt abandoned by his own country. He said: 'It is sad and disappointing that this has happened, the fact that your own country won't help you. 'It is a horrible, horrible situation to be in.' 'To have to resort to a social media campaign and involve your MP - it's not something we thought we would have to do. 'It's quite upsetting.

The \u2018fake it till you make it\u2019 theory is based on the assumption that if you act out the thing you want to happen, sometimes it will. Psychologists use the same technique on depressed patients: the act of smiling triggers hormones which make us feel happier so a forced smile eventually turns into a real one. Sexpert Tracey Cox says for some women pretending to climax could actually bring on the real thing. The women in the study said if they pretended to orgasm, their partner got more excited, which got them more excited. By reenacting the lead-up to a real orgasm - breathing faster, making noise, moving your hips, tensing your muscles - you might just push yourself over the threshold to the point where orgasm becomes involuntary. But there are two crucial points that need to be made here. First up, the study was based on women who weren\u2019t in relationships so the overall percentage of \u2018fakers\u2019 (80 per cent) is hopefully lower in couples who are more comfortable with each other. It\u2019s also best not to use the \u2018fake it to make it\u2019 technique at the beginning of relationships (unless you explain that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, which is unlikely). How is your partner ever going to learn to give you a real orgasm if they think they\u2019re doing it already? The absolute worst time to fake an orgasm is at the start of a relationship, which is, of course, when most women (and some men) do it. Keep on doing it and you\u2019ve set up a pattern of behaviour that\u2019s based on deception and dissatisfaction. He\u2019ll keep on using the same ineffectual techniques because he thinks he\u2019s turning you on; you\u2019ll remain frustrated and irritable every time you have sex. Having the courage to say \u201cActually, that does nothing for me,\u201d isn\u2019t easy but you really must. Communication is the key to good sex - and faking orgasm (for reasons that aren\u2019t so helpful) isn\u2019t necessary if admitting to not having one isn\u2019t a problem!

However, the study also found that some women fake it to make it a real orgasm happen, as pretending to orgasm can increase arousal levels. It's important to note that communication is key in sexual relationships, and faking orgasms can lead to a pattern of deception and dissatisfaction."}
{"article": "When it comes to four-wheel grand prix racing, Britain\u2019s future looks in good hands. Lewis Hamilton is the Formula One world champion, and judging by the form he showed to win the Australian Grand Prix, he looks in good shape to become the first ever British driver to retain his title. But glance towards two-wheel grand prix racing and you will find Britain is still dining off championships and even race wins from the late great Barry Sheene. Britain's Cal Crutchlow will be riding for the LCR Honda team during the 2015 MotoGP season. Crutchlow hopes to hit the front of the MotoGP grid with Honda after a disappointing year with Ducati. MotoGP has arrived in Qatar to kick off the 2015 season on Sunday, and while Britain is looking for its first premier class victory since Sheene triumphed in Sweden in 1981 \u2013 its future also looks intriguingly bright. YEAR. 2014. 2013. 2012. 2011. TEAM. Ducati. Tech3. Tech3. Tech3. PLACING. 13th (74 pts) 5th (188 pts) 7th (151 pts) 12th (70 pts) In fact, the talent coming through is arguably showing greater promise than that seen in F1 right now. Bradley Smith, 24, and Scott Redding, 22, impressed during 2014 and will be targeting podium finishes as a realistic possibility this season. For Cal Crutchlow, he\u2019s been there before \u2013 often narrowly missing out on the top step of the podium in 2013. But following a terrible season at Ducati last year, the Coventry born star once again looks in a position where he could sneak on an opportunity to end Britain\u2019s 34-year wait for a premier class race win. In 2015, Crutchlow will be on a Honda bike not too far off the specification ridden by double world champion Marc Marquez, who dominated the 2014 campaign after winning the opening 10 races on his factory Honda. Crutchlow tests his LCR Honda around Malaysia's Sepang circuit during a pre-season test for his new team. The Brit has also been testing at Qatar's Losail circuit - posting impressive lap times. Riding for the satellite LCR Honda outfit, race wins are not expected but they certainly won\u2019t be ruled out. It\u2019s very much the same scenario that Crutchlow was in at Yamaha\u2019s Tech3 team in 2012 and 2013 and one the 29-year-old is aiming to return to. \u2018So many guys could get on the podium.\u2019 Crutchlow told Sportsmail. \u2018There are 15 guys that are all so close at the moment. \u2018I\u2019d like to say my chances of getting on the podium are more than they were last year. If I could get back to where I was in 2013 and 2012, I\u2019d be quite happy because we were competitive enough there when I finished fifth and seventh in the championship. They were good years.\u2019 Crutchlow sounds upbeat. There\u2019s a positive tone to his voice and a calmness to him which suggests he is much happier now than when I spoke to him at Silverstone last August, shortly after his Ducati departure following just one season was confirmed. Ducati was always going to be a tough monster to tame. Even the great Valentino Rossi gave up on the bike following two highly uncompetitive years. Crutchlow reflects that while he has no resentment towards the team, he was constantly on the back foot following a big crash in just his second race on the Desmosedici. 'The Austin crash wrecked the season for me,' Crutchlow added. 'From that point on it was a downward spiral because I was riding injured for a long time but up until Texas I was riding good and was really confident. Cal Crutchlow rides his Ducati around Aragon during practice for last year's grand prix. Crutchlow would on to clinch third behind Aleix Espargaro (left) and race winner Jorge Lorenzo during the Grand Prix at Aragon late in the season which would prove to be his only podium with Ducati. \u2018When I crashed at Texas, it was through no fault of my own. It was of the biggest crashes that I\u2019ve ever had when I really hurt my hand but I came back too soon. The other two Ducati riders were riding really well at the time and it was like a double whammy. \u2018We came back towards the end of the season and we started to ride very strongly, but I enjoyed my time at Ducati and they look to be doing a great job this year.\u2019 Crutchlow referred to the testing times that saw Andrea Dovizioso top the time sheets in a pre-season Qatar test, but it\u2019s not just the Italian outfit that are on resurgence. Having ridden much of 2014 injured, Crutchlow states that he is going into the new season with no problems and that includes on", "abstract": "Britain's Cal Crutchlow is hoping to end Britain's 34-year wait for a premier class race win in the 2015 MotoGP season.

{"article": "(CNN)We have no problem taking Wall Street executives to task for decisions that leave American families financially devastated, yet we give Silicon Valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing. America needs to realize that instead of creating jobs, Silicon Valley is erasing them, leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground. Silicon Valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday's laptop. The commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education, a young person in America can get a good job. But despite falling unemployment, college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low-paying jobs that don't even require a college degree. The percentage of young people languishing in low-skill, low-paying jobs is 44%, a 20-year high. Only 36% of college grads have jobs that pay at least $45,000, a sharp decline from the 1990s, after adjusting for inflation. Perhaps most depressingly, the percentage of young people making below $25,000 has topped 20%, worse than in 1990. In other words, those with a bachelor's diploma were better off before the digital revolution. If this comes as a surprise, that's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude. In our collective imagination, millennials are saying, \"No jobs? That's OK \u2014 I'll create my own!\" And then they solve their own problems by heading to Silicon Valley with little more than an iPhone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires. A fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be Mike Bean, founder of Internet behemoth Gryzzl on the show \"Parks and Recreation.\" Played by Blake Anderson, Bean might best be described as \"barefoot and pregnant with ideas.\" The bumbling entrepreneur conquers the world practically by accident, armed only with his digital savvy, a can-do spirit, and a penchant for invading users' privacy. You get the idea that his success came easily. Privacy concerns aside, the Mike Beans of America are just about as rare as the Mark Zuckerbergs. In fact, the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24-year low. Garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups. But wait \u2014 won't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs? After a period of adjustment, won't things get better? Unfortunately that's not the path we're on. One of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology, there's a new, equally good (or better) job created by Silicon Valley. But exactly the opposite is happening. The digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs: minimum wage jobs (think Amazon warehouse employees) and so-called \"sharing-economy jobs\" (think Uber drivers). The sharing-economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers. Sharing economy jobs aren't really jobs at all; they're freelance gigs. Sure, Silicon Valley doesn't owe America jobs. But something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages, decreased worker protection and zero job security. This \"winner-take-all\" digital economy is not sustainable. People on both sides of the political spectrum are worried. Liberal luminary Robert Reich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and former secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, calls the sharing economy the \"share-the-scraps\" economy. Speaking of tech companies that utilize on-demand labor, such as Uber, Instacart and Taskrabbit, he says, \"The big money goes to the corporations that own the software. The scraps go to the on-demand workers.\" Meanwhile, conservative columnist Ross Douthat fears a dystopian future in which \"a rich, technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents.\" Put simply, Silicon Valley's utopia is the rest of America's dystopia. And those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates, whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback. And if you think your own job is safe, think again. New research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades. This is a giant leap backward, but it's deceptively described as technological \"progress.\" As anyone who's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest, \"automated\" usually means \"worse.\" What can be done? How can we fight this slide back toward the Middle Ages? If we take no action, we're headed toward a kind of digital world feudalism where there are a handful of kings, a lot of peasants and no middle class. There's no easy fix, but we can do three things immediately. First, we can stop glorifying tech tit", "abstract": "Silicon Valley is erasing jobs instead of creating them, leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can even begin.

A police officer who had sex with women while he was on duty asked one of them to'send some filth' in a text message, a court heard. Staffordshire Police officer Adam Rushton is accused of having sex with four women while he was on duty, including one dalliance at a police station where a woman is said to have put handcuffs on him. One of the women who Rushton is accused of seducing said they had sex around five times and he also asked her to send dirty pictures in a text messages. He first met the woman, then 21, after she reported a burglary in July 2006, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said she kept in touch with Rushton after the incident - informing him of her new address every time she moved as well as her contact details. She said she kept in touch with him in case she needed anything or to be protected. In November 2011, Rushton sent the woman a text, which read: 'Still waiting, send some filth'. She told the jury: 'By 2011, I had known Adam for quite a while. Contact could go on for a month and then he would not hear from me for a while. 'He may have asked for pictures from me, some intimate pictures maybe but I replied telling him \"no, I am not sending naughty pics to your work phone.\"' The woman described Rushton as a 'nice police officer' and said on one occasion they had sex after he turned up in his police uniform. She added: 'Adam was the only person to give a damn. If I had said \"Adam, no I am not going to send anything,\" he would have stopped. There was no pressure. 'I think at the time I used Adam but only when I needed somebody. 'There might have been other texts but I cannot remember. 'We never met anywhere sordid. We had sex four or five times. He was wearing his uniform on one occasion when he came round so I presume he must have driven in his police car.' Rushton denies ten counts of misconduct in public office and two counts of obtaining personal data without permission. The officer was suspended after the allegations came to light in 2013. Prosecutors have accused him of using his position to engineer relationships with seven  women during a six year spell from 2006. Rushton was suspended from Staffordshire Police (headquarters pictured) when the allegations came to light. Rushton has been accused of sending  a woman explicit selfies of himself while wearing his uniform, as well as picking another woman up in a patrol car before taking her back to Longton Police station in Stoke-on-Trent where they had sex in an office. Prosecutor Duncan Bould said: 'He picked her up in a marked car, in uniform, and she had to wait in the car while he checked the coast was clear.' Mr Bould said the only purpose for taking the woman into the station was'sexual activity,' But he said as she put his handcuffs on him and things started to go further they were disturbed and had to leave. On another occasion, the court heard Rushton persuaded a woman to show him her private parts after he turned up at her home.

{"article": "Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has seen a reaction from goal-shy Graziano Pelle after dropping him in the league for the first time. The 29-year-old striker enjoyed a dream start to life at St Mary's after moving from Feyenoord in a reported \u00a39million summer deal. Pelle scored nine goals in his first 12 matches for Saints in all competitions and netted the winner on his debut for Italy. Graziano Pelle (19) has struggled with form recently and wasn't happy at being dropped for the first time. The goals have dried up of late, though, and he was replaced in the starting line-up by Shane Long in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Chelsea. Pelle ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle, having played the final few minutes, and Koeman hopes the striker can end his three-month wait for a Premier League goal when Burnley visit this weekend. 'There has been a little bit of a reaction, yes, because nobody is happy to stay on the bench,' the Saints boss said. Ronald Koeman (centre) says he's'seen a reaction' from Pelle after leaving him on the bench against Chelsea. 'Sometimes you need a reaction off the player in that situation. He is doing well. 'In that game, in that moment, I think it was good to change the way of playing with more fast players up front. Saturday we play at home.' Koeman has no fresh injury worries to contend with against Burnley, with Eljero Elia coming back into contention after missing last week's match through injury. Sean Dyche's relegation-threatened side head to St Mary's buoyed by last weekend's shock win over champions Manchester City and having overcome Southampton 1-0 earlier in the season. 'Yeah, they beat us but it wasn't a very good game that day and we missed a penalty,' Koeman said. The targetman was in superb form at the start of the season and scored nine goals in 12 matches. 'It was a stupid goal against us but, of course, we analyse always the opponent and we play 11 against 11 and then one team is playing like Burnley. 'Sometimes it is difficult to prepare a training session for the match, but we expect an aggressive opponent who will press us with direct play. 'That is always difficult because they don't give you time to play and you have to that and you have to prepare for that.' Saturday's match will be their last before a two-week international break, during which time many of Southampton's players will be away with their national teams. Martin Odegaard (left) was linked with a loan move to the Saints next season but Koeman denied the claims. England duo Nathaniel Clyne and Fraser Forster are amongst those players, with some eyebrows raised by the fact left-back Ryan Bertrand did not join them in Roy Hodgson's squad. 'I am not surprised,' Koeman said. 'He had suspension for three games. After that he came back and is playing well. 'I think he played very well against Chelsea but I am not surprised because his time will come if he keeps working like this, keeps playing like this.' The 16-year-old signed for Real Madrid from Norwegian side\u00a0Str\u00f8msgodset and big things are expected. Meanwhile, Koeman downplayed speculation linking Southampton with a loan move for talented Real Madrid teenager Martin Odegaard. 'It is not my job to do scouting of young players,' he said of the 16-year-old Norwegian midfielder.

{"article": "Connecticut's Democratic governor says he will ban state-funded travel to Indiana over a controversial religious freedom law. 'I found it disturbing, disgraceful and outright discriminatory,' the state's chief executive, Dannel Malloy, said during a news conference on an unrelated issue. 'It hearkens back to a time when states were allowed to pass laws that treated their citizens differently. It's our shared past where discrimination was codified into our laws.' Connecticut will become the first state to bar travel to Indiana since its governor signed the religious freedom law last Thursday. Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco, California, have sent out similar orders, however. The bill, signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has the effect of giving individuals legal cover to refuse a customer's business if it would violate a religious belief to fulfill the request. Civil rights groups are characterizing the law as discriminatory, particularly against LGBT persons, and Republican lawmakers in the state today said they'd be open to clarifying the bill's intent through legislative changes. Demonstrators gather at the Indiana State Capitol on Saturday to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Governor Mike Pence. More than 2,000 people attended the Indianapolis rally. Critics say it would promote discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation. DUELING GOVERNORS: Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, left, a Democrat, said today that he would bar state-funded travel to Indiana in light of the new law, signed by into existence last Thursday by that state's chief executive, Mike Pence, a Republican. The details of Connecticut's retaliatory measure are not yet known. Malloy said Monday morning on Twitter that because of the law, 'later today I will sign an executive order regarding state-funded travel.' 'When new laws turn back the clock on progress, we can\u2019t sit idly by. We are sending a message that discrimination won\u2019t be tolerated,' he said in a follow up tweet. At a press conference later that day, Malloy said his state 'led the way to end discrimination and we should continue to be a leader in speaking out against discrimination across the entirety of the nation.' 'No state should use religious grounds to be the basis for discrimination in our country,' Malloy said, according to NBC Connecticut. 'Let me point out that it is a sad fact that in our history religion was used as a basis to support treating black and white individuals differently as well, and I won't allow any of our citizens in Connecticut to face discrimination in other states, at least without a fight.' More than 2,000 demonstrators showed up outside the Indiana State Capitol on Saturday to protest the new measure passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly that Indiana says is meant to give its residents a platform to bring religious freedom suits against the government. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act states that 'a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability' unless the government has a 'compelling' interest to do so and interference is the 'least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.' The Indiana law now under a microscope says that 'a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion.' The only exception to that rule is if the government can show it has a 'compelling' interest to interfere and it did so through 'the least restrictive means.' A party that prevails over the government in court can now ask for 'compensatory damages' and may be awarded 'all or part of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.' Civil rights activists argue that the law is overly broad because it can be interpreted to apply not only to individuals acting in their personal capacity, but also to businesses. Furthermore, it goes beyond protecting Indiana residents' interests from intrusion by the state - it gives them legal cover from threats to their religious freedom from private entities, as well. Critics of the legislation claim it legally allows businesses to refuse the business of gay couples. A commonly cited example is that of a bakery that declines to take on the order for a wedding cake of a same-sex couple, citing religious grounds. Gay rights activists say such discriminatory behavior would not be allowed under Indiana law as a result of the religious freedom bill. A similar bill could soon become law in Arkansas. That state's bill, having already received the go ahead from the House, passed the Senate on Friday and now heads to recently elected Governor Asa Hutchinson's desk. Arkansas's legislation stats that 'governments should not substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification.' Hutchinson, a Republican, has already signaled his support for the law. WalMart, which is based out of Arkansas, and Apple CEO Tim Cook sided against the GOP-backed measure over the weekend. 'We feel this legislation is counter to this core basic belief of respect for the individual and sends the wrong message about Arkansas, as well as the diverse environment which exists in the state,' a spokesman for Walmart said in a statement provided to Reuters.

In the past seven days, by contrast, I\u2019ve attended a leaving party for friends in their late 50s who are starting a new life in the country; given a presentation on Post-War Art And The Politics Of Memory to fellow undergraduates on my part-time degree course; drooled over Ralph Fiennes in his latest theatre production; and hosted supper for some girlfriends \u2014 finding time, in between, to buy a pair of skinny jeans and get my roots tinted. Like most women of my age, I\u2019m occasionally exhausted, but in the main, engaged, active and having as much (if not more) fun than ever. Linda Kelsey says aged 62 she is occasionally exhausted but is very active and having more fun than ever. So, I can\u2019t understand why Mariella Frostrup \u2014 a woman who is smart, successful, has the voice of a vamp and looks that make men of most ages go weak at the knees \u2014 has declared herself, at a mere 52, the poster girl for the fed up 50-something brigade. Despite the evidence to the contrary, Frostrup thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation. \u2018Politicians don\u2019t talk to us,\u2019 she moans. \u2018Advertisers ignore us. We aren\u2019t sold music or movies, fashion or cosmetics, aside from \u201cmiracle\u201d creams promising to reduce wrinkles so we dare show our unsightly faces in public.\u2019 It simply isn\u2019t so, Mariella. Julianne Moore, 54, has won an Oscar, Julie Walters, 65, has stolen the limelight from the young, good-looking cast of Channel 4\u2019s Indian Summers and 50 Shades Of Grey, based on the books of E. L. James, 51, has become the highest grossing 18-plus film ever. Monica Bellucci, 50, is smouldering away as the latest Bond girl, 65-year-old Twiggy is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign, and Theresa May, 58, is said to be in the running as a potential next leader of the Tory party. All this as The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, full of fabulous oldies, promises to outdo the success of the first on the (truly) silver screen. Mariella Frostrup, 52 (pictured), thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation. Having conflated her existential angst at turning 50 with what she perceives is going on in society at large, Mariella seems to have missed the blindingly obvious fact that older women have never been so visible \u2014 or so courted. Not just by politicians, who know the grey vote is the most likely to turn out at the ballot box. But now we\u2019re worth more than a bob or two (over-50s represent 76 per cent of the nation\u2019s wealth), by retailers and advertisers who realise we\u2019re worth wooing because of, and despite, our wrinkles. That makes me grateful, not grumpy. Compared with our mothers\u2019 generation, there\u2019s been a seismic shift in attitudes. Even if there\u2019s still a way to go we should be recognising that whole new windows of opportunity have opened up.

Yet when I saw older friends were getting on with their lives with added relish, I was determined to enter my new half-century with cocktails and laughter. To paraphrase Noel Coward: to hell with what comes after. I hired a marquee and invited 100 family and friends to eat, drink and dance the night away. The party broke up at 3am when the police shut us down because the music was annoying neighbours three streets away.

But while former generations had to suffer in silence, with HRT and alternative remedies and therapies, we can at least alleviate some of the symptoms.

Mass migration will also drive big changes as parts of the planet become much less inhabitable.' In Melbourne the vision is that it will have a great towerscape/city skyline. In Sydney the Harbour Bridge will be white-grey, covered in solar absorbing material and will also have large open scoops over its main arches that collect massive amounts of rainwater.

After the plight of Cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week, readers donated an extraordinary \u00a330,000 to Animal Defenders International, which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in Peru earlier this month. The elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus, where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box, and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself. Scroll down for video. Cholita (pictured) lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus in Peru. Cholita - known as the real-life Paddington bear (pictured) - suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and fur. The money raised will allow the organisation to travel more than 600 miles on treacherous mountain and desert roads, which are often little more than dirt tracks, to reach the bear in a zoo near the north-western city of Piura and drive her to the Peruvian capital, Lima. The two drivers and the truck, equipped with a new cage, hay and blankets, will alone cost \u00a32,700, and the bear will also need help from veterinary staff and a support team, who will fly to Piura in advance. When the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow Cholita to leave the country, they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in South America to the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado in the United States, where she can live out her days in peace. Because she is a spectacled bear, the same endangered species as Paddington in the children\u2019s books by Michael Bond, there are stringent conditions to be met before the authorities permit her to cross state boundaries. The organisation, which campaigns against the exploitation of wild animals, will have to delay Cholita\u2019s flight by several weeks to ensure she is allowed aboard, at a further cost of thousands of pounds a day, so it is still appealing for funds. Its president, Jan Creamer, said: \u2018We have been overwhelmed by the response from Mail on Sunday readers to help Cholita. We now need one last push so that she can begin her journey to freedom.

{"article": "Zaur Dadayev (pictured) was originally reported to have confessed to the killing, but has now claimed this confession was made under torture and threat of death. The only man to so far confess to the killing of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov has dramatically denied any guilt and claims his confession was forced under torture and threat of death. Zaur Dadayev was said to have admitted to the killing but he now claims he was told that by confessing, a friend he was with could go free. If he failed to confess he would be killed in a grenade explosion, a fate he alleged another suspect named Bislan Shavanov met in recent days. Five people have been detained in connection with Nemtsov's shooting on February 27. Dadaev was the only one who, according to a judge, confessed to the killing, though in court he didn't admit guilt. He said:\u00a0'At the time of the arrest I was with a friend, my former subordinate Ruslan Yusupov. And they said that if I confessed, he would be freed. 'Otherwise the same thing would happen to me as to Shavanov.' The official version is that Shavanov killed himself with a grenade as police came to arrest him. He added he was not guilty and the judge did not allow him to speak, he told Moskovskiy Komsomolets newspaper. Human rights experts who met Dadayev and other suspects in detention found 'traces of torture and beating' on their bodies, it was reported. 'We are carefully checking into this,' said chairman of the Moscow Public Monitoring Commission, Anton Tsvetkov. 'There are reasons that lead us to believe Zaur Dadayev confessed under torture,' said Andrei Babushkin, a member of the Kremlin's human rights council. There were 'numerous wounds' on the body of the suspect. Earlier law enforcement sources claimed forensic tests 'give reasons to believe that Dadayev was the man who shot Nemtsov'. However, the source admitted the murder weapon had not been found yet. Nemtsov - a prominent Putin foe - was gunned down close to the Kremlin on 27 February as he walked home late at night with his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya. Nemtsov was gunned down close to the Kremlin last month as he walked home late at night with his girlfriend. His body sits in a body-bag as authorities work at the scene of his killing in Moscow last month. More startling revelations to be reported today included claims Nemtsov's murder was ordered by a senior security official in Chechnya. The identity of the man - named only Ruslan, and said to be a close relative of top political figures in the region - is known to Vladimir Putin and the FSB, but he has not been detained, reported Novaya Gazeta, Russia's leading investigative newspaper. The Russian president has been told in addition that three other prominent liberal figures are on a chilling Chechen 'hit list'. They are exiled Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who was jailed for a decade under Putin but now says he has ambitions to become president; Alexei Venediktov, respected editor of editorially independent Ekho Mosocw radio; and glamorous Ksenia Sobchak, a TV presenter and opposition blogger, daughter of the president's political mentor Anatoly Sobchak, former mayor of St Petersburg. Other media in Russia today named him as Ruslan Geremeev. In sensational claims, the newspaper reported that the man who ordered 55-year-old Nemtsov's murder is a highly decorated major in the same Interior Ministry unit called 'North' in Chechnya in which alleged killer Dadayev served until recently. Novaya Gazeta said it did not name him because of the presumption of innocence, but admitted the alleged mastermind's identity 'is known to dozens, if not hundreds, of members of the FSB and the Investigation Committee'. People walk past flowers left at the site where Nemtsov was killed on the evening of February 27. Nemtsov was a prominent anti-Putin foe. Pictured is his casket being carried at his funeral. He is said to have been questioned by investigators on Monday, though not detained. His uncle was named as Suleiman Geremeev, a senator for Chechnya in the Russian upper house. Another relative is Russian MP Adam Delimkhanov, a close henchman of powerful Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadryov, a key Putin ally. 'The head of state was informed about the details by the director of the FSB Alexander Bortnikov,' reported Novaya Gazeta, which is part-owned by ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and by Alexander Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard. Several reports say the disclosures prevent a major challenge for Putin, because he must allow the prosecution of a key figure from the security services professing total loyalty to him in Chechnya", "abstract": "The man who confessed to the killing of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov has now claimed that his confession was made under torture and threat of death.

The hoses outside the front  of\u00a0Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission. News of their existence emerged via CBS News\u00a0this week, triggering outcry from the wider community. Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night -'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources'. Against building regulations: The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its porchways. Discreet: The hoses outside the front of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission. Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless, added that the time-triggered mechanisms were 'certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.' However, the church defended the sprinkler idea stating that it wasn't safe having homeless people and drug addicts lurking when families were visiting. Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, told CBS that staff tried to find other forms of accommodation for those without shelter. 'We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,' Lyford said. 'To Saint Anthony's soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.' Wrong move: Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night -'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources' Roughing it: A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas. Lyford claimed he did not know about the sprinkler system until it was brought to his attention but another church staff member said the spouts were installed over a year ago. According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas. 'You've got some pretty hardcore homeless people who actually don\u2019t care... so they\u2019ll go in there and sleep.'

However, now the sprinklers will be taken down as they reportedly violate the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection code. The church has 15 days to comply and remove the system. Bishop William Justice,\u00a0the rector of Saint Mary's Cathedral, issued a statement apologizing for any upset the church's homeless deterrent had caused. He said the sprinklers were modeled on similar systems used in the city\u2019s Financial District 'as a safety, security and cleanliness measure to avoid the situation where needles, feces and other dangerous items were regularly being left in these hidden doorways. 'The problem was particularly dangerous because students and elderly people regularly pass these locations on their way to school and mass every day,' he added. Justice said since the archdiocese has learned the system may violate the city\u2019s water-use laws, work to remove it would be 'completed by the end of the day'.", "abstract": "The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to remove a sprinkler system that was installed two years ago without necessary planning permission.

{"article": "Murdered in prison: Carlos Manuel Perez Jr., 28, was handcuffed when he died from multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms. A Nevada prison inmate was handcuffed when was shot and killed by a guard last November, according to a lawyer who said Wednesday that her client was wounded in the same shooting but survived. Carlos Manuel Perez Jr. was slain with his hands cuffed behind his back, attorney Alexis Plunkett said. Inmate Andrew Jay Arevalo was also handcuffed and'miraculously survived three shotgun blasts to the face,' Plunkett said. 'This is what I clearly consider to be an excessive use of force,' she said in an email to The Associated Press. Plunkett said she represents Arevalo, not Perez, and plans to sue the guard, prison officials and the state. 'This is a terribly tragic and completely unnecessary shooting,' Plunkett said. Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy said Wednesday that he ruled Perez's death a homicide from multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms. Murphy noted his ruling meant Perez, 28, died at the hands of another person. It didn't establish fault. Nevada prisons chief Greg Cox said in a statement issued after the coroner's ruling became public that Arevalo and Perez were fighting when a guard at High Desert State Prison opened fire. Policy and procedure were followed in contacting the coroner, Las Vegas police and the prisons inspector general, Cox said. The Department of Corrections director didn't mention handcuffs and didn't identify the guard. But he said the shooter was one of three correctional officers who remain on administrative leave pending completion of a Nevada Department of Investigations report and a review by the state attorney general's office. Patty Cafferata, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, said the case will be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken. Laxalt's office also could be called on to defend the state in wrongful-death and excessive-force lawsuits. A spokeswoman for Gov. Brian Sandoval referred questions about the case to Cox. Perez and Arevalo were being housed separately in a disciplinary wing, known as 'the hole', where inmates are handcuffed behind their backs when they are outside their cells, and no more than one inmate is usually allowed out of a cell at the same time, Plunkett said. 'Procedure was followed because Perez and my client were both handcuffed,' the attorney said. 'But procedure was not followed because they were out of their individual cells at the same time. Scene: Perez and Arevalo were in the 'hole', or administrative segregation,\u00a0at High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada, in November, when they started fighting. Both were handcuffed, but prison guards opened fire on each. Perez died and Arevalo survived. Plunkett added: 'Obviously, in light of the shooting, the procedural violation is the least of the issues.' Plunkett said she has talked with an attorney for Perez's family. But she declined to identify the attorney. 'This was not a riot,' Plunkett told The Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'There was no threat to a CO. There was not threat to any other inmates.' Perez's younger brother, Victor Perez, 30, said the family were not properly told what happened to his sibling. Three days after he died, they visited his body in the mortuary and were shocked to see it riddled with bullets. 'We had to undress him ourselves to take pictures of his wounds,' Mr Perez told The Review-Journal. 'Everything was hidden from us.' Deputy Clark County Public Defender Claudia Romney represented Perez when he pleaded guilty in December 2012 in Las Vegas to battery causing substantial bodily harm, but she doesn't represent him now. Records show that Perez was sentenced in February 2013 to 18 months to four years in prison. Police said he hit a man in the head with a two-by-four piece of lumber while man was walking with his daughter and son on a downtown Las Vegas street. Perez was previously convicted of felony domestic battery for choking his girlfriend nine months after their baby girl was born. He was sentenced in May 2010 to one to three years in state prison. Arevalo, 24, pleaded guilty in June 2013 in Las Vegas to burglary and was sentenced in August 2013 to two to six years in prison. Prisons officials issued a 78-word statement the day after Perez died saying he had been in prison since March 2013, that an autopsy and investigation would be conducted, and that no further details about his death were available at that time. The statement didn't say Perez had been shot or that Arevalo had been wounded. At the state Legislature in Carson City, elected officials were surprised Wednesday to learn that a prison guard shot and killed an inmate a full 19 weeks earlier.

And now, one fertility expert has offered some insight into Kim's struggle, suggesting that the global star's hectic lifestyle may be to blame. Kim Kardashian, who is already mother to one-year-old North West, has said she is 'desperate' to conceive a sibling for her daughter... but one fertility expert says her hectic lifestyle may be to blame. Speaking to new! magazine, Mr Paul Serhal, Medical Director at CRGH, a leading fertility clinic in London, said: 'Kim should reduce her hectic lifestyle in order to increase her chances.' Kim - who has been flying all over the world over fashion month, starring in shoots and tending to the needs of her one-year-old daughter - needs to take a break, says Mr Serhal. 'Flying is a common cause of infertility in high-profile, professional women because it can impact on the regularity of the ovulation cycle. Speaking on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the 34-year-old reality star said she wants to conceive a sibling for baby North - to the point where she and Kanye were having intercourse multiple times per day. 'Ovulation time is critical because women aren\u2019t fertile throughout the whole month. This is another reason IVF could be a good option for Kim. You collect ten or 11 eggs and effectively pack one year of ovulation into one IVF cycle of treatment.' Mr Serhal believes that thanks to her age, Kim, who has already proved she can conceive naturally,  would have a very good chance of getting pregnant with IVF. He explains that women in their 30s - like Kim - have a 60 per cent chance of conceiving through IVF. Kim, who has been flying all over the world over fashion month, needs to take a break, says Mr Serhal. On the E! show, Kim was seen lying supine to allow Kanye's sperm to'marinade' inside her. 'The doctors said I have to lie down for 1- minutes after sex...and I had sex just before you got here,' Kim said as her sisters groaned in disgust. 'Lying flat after sex wont make any difference,' said Mr Serhal.

She screamed and spat it out and was taken to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital. There, doctors said the mystery substance'smelt like false nail glue'. Six-year-old Jessica (left) with her father Dwain (right), who had bought the milk from Iceland the previous day. Jessica's mother Samantha, 31, who has five other children, said she was left with glue all over her fingers after the incident.

Her father Dwain had bought the milk from an Iceland store in Plymouth the previous day. Samantha, from Devonport, Plymouth, said: 'It's just disgusting. She freaked out and was very shaken. 'She remembers spitting it out in the sink the second she felt something was wrong. It's just lucky she didn't ingest it because this could have been a completely different situation.'

{"article": "The 21-year-old son of a Utah doctor found guilty of murder in the 2011 death of his cancer researcher ex-wife has spoken out about how he fought for three years for his father to be convicted. Salt Lake City pediatrician John Brickman Wall, 51, was convicted of killing Uta von Schwedler in September 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute. He faces up to life in prison. The case was highly contentious, with prosecutors alleging Wall had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed von Schwedler killed herself. Their son, Pelle Wall, said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself, he didn't believe it. Scroll down for video. Pelle Wall, 21, publicly believed his Salt Lake City pediatrician father, John Wall, was guilty of murdering his mother, Uta von Schwedler in 2011. After spending his entire inheritance from his mother on a campaign to convict his father, Pelle wants a confession. 'As I thought about... my dad's behavior before and after her death, it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her,' Pelle told CBS's 48 Hours. Prosecutors alleged Wall attacked 49-year-old Uta von Schwedler with a knife, dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug Xanax and drowned her in her bathtub. Defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable, and it was more likely von Schwedler killed herself. Her death initially was treated as a suicide. But family and friends pushed for more investigation, saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life. Pelle told CBS that he feared for his and his sibling's lives, worrying that they might be living with a murder. 'Part of the reason I was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling's safety - was that I saw this anger that he had towards my mother,' Pelle said. 'It didn't die with her. It jumped and it expanded.' The couple's oldest son, Pelle Wall (left) had testified at the trial claiming that his father was acting bizarre after the family learned von Schwedler had died.\u00a0John Wall (right) was found guilty of murdering his ex-wife in March. Uta Von Schwedler's body was found in an overflowing bathtub in September 2011 and her death was initially ruled a suicide but further investigation led to the conviction of her ex-husband John Brickman Wall. Salt Lake City officials made no effort to remove the children from Wall's home and the investigation was put on hold. On the day before his 18th birthday in January 2012, Pelle moved out of his father's house into the home of his best friend, Jessica Oglesby, and was welcomed by her parents with open arms. But he had left his siblings behind. 'I realized that my presence there was not protecting my siblings,' he told CBS, adding that his father was upset that he had moved out. 'And once I had that realization and I moved out, then I could take active steps to protect them.' Pelle then fought for custody of his siblings and eventually won. The children were all moved into homes of family friends. His father sued him for a number of family scrapbooks that had been treasured items within the family. One of the books had been found next to von Schwedler's body. Pelle countered his father's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit, holding his father responsible in the death of his mother. Wall was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of von Schwedler. The evidence in the case was unusual: A medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on von Schwedler's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack, but he couldn't explain the fatal level of Xanax in her system. Forensic experts had very different interpretations of the scene. Pelle Wall (left) spent his entire inheritance from his mother (right) campaigning for his father's conviction. He said now he wants a confession from his father. For the prosecution, spilled antihistamine pills on the floor, a house in disarray and bloodstains in von Schwedler's bed showed she was attacked. The defense said the home revealed signs of a troubled woman who died trying to calm herself with medication. 'The state just can't throw up a whole bunch of theories,' John Wall's lawyer Fred Metos said during closing arguments Thursday. He added self-injury is a rare side effect of Xanax. Prosecutors said von Schwedler studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease. She had no prescription for Xanax, but John Wall filled a large one for his mother months before his ex-wife's death. 'He resented her efforts to see the children, to talk with the children, to text the children, to email the children,' prosecutor Nick D'Alesandro said during closings. 'He just couldn't stop talking about how much he hated her", "abstract": "John Brickman Wall, a Salt Lake City pediatrician, has been found guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Uta von Schwedler, in 2011.

{"article": "Is your libido flagging? If so, then a lack of sleep may be the reason why, researchers claim. A study has found a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day. The amount of shut-eye also affects how aroused they will become. The study, involving 171 women, showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent. Poor sex drive? Getting more sleep is directly linked with an increase in libido, new research has shown. Sleep was also important for genital arousal, according to the research, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. Specifically, women who slept longer experienced fewer problems with vaginal arousal than those who obtained less sleep. 'The influence of sleep on sexual desire and arousal has received little attention in the field,' said Dr David Kalmbach, of the University of Michigan. 'But these findings indicate that insufficient sleep can decrease sexual desire and arousal for women. He added: 'I think the take-home message should not be that more sleep is better, but that it is important to allow ourselves to obtain the sleep that our mind and body needs.' And it's not just women - previous research found men with poor sleep patterns have significantly lower levels of testosterone, which results in a lack of sex drive. Experts say that reduced levels of the hormone can bring a host of other negative consequences for young men, including reduced libido and poor reproduction. They can fail to build enough strength through muscle mass and bone density, leading to low energy levels, poor concentration and fatigue. Low testosterone levels are also linked to the metabolic syndrome - a cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the chances of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Scientists from the University of Chicago found men who get less than five hours sleep a night for a week or longer suffer have far less levels of testosterone than those who get a good night's rest. The study showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent - and increased levels of arousal. Their study found that the levels of the hormone are reduced dramatically to levels more akin to someone 15 years older. 'Low testosterone levels are associated with reduced wellbeing and vigour, which may also occur as a consequence of sleep loss,' said Professor Eve Van Cauter, who led the study. Other reasons for low libido include poor diet, being overweight and low iron levels. An estimated one in four British women doesn\u2019t get enough iron from their diet, and iron deficiency is known to leave your libido lagging, says Dr Radha Modgil, a GP in West London with a special interest in sexual health. \u2018Low iron levels are thought to reduce the quality of blood flow and so sap energy,\u2019 she explains. \u2018If you\u2019re exhausted, sex is obviously the last thing you feel like doing.\u2019 \u2018The best source of easily absorbable iron is a nice juicy steak,\u2019 adds dietitian Helen Bond. \u2018Red meat like steak helps release key amino acids from the brain which are important for good mood.\u2019 Other reasons for low libido include poor diet, being overweight and low iron levels. Dietitians say red meat such as steak is a good, easy-absorbed form of iron. \u2018Red meat is also a good source of B vitamins, which help convert the carbohydrates we eat into energy. It\u2019s also a rich source of zinc, important for the production of the sex hormone testosterone, which women also need for sexual desire. Other good sources of zinc include beans, nuts and oysters.\u2019 Eating too much white bread and other refined carbohydrates can sap your sex drive, says Helen Bond. \u2018Foods such as white bread release the sugar more quickly than their wholegrain counterparts \u2014 and too much sugar is associated with energy slumps, which mean you won\u2019t have the energy for sex,\u2019 she adds. Too much sugar also makes you fat, raising the level of oestrogen in the body, in turn reducing testosterone levels in men, says gynaecologist Peter Bowen-Simpkins,. \u2018If you\u2019re obese, you feel less attractive. You also have reduced blood flow to the sex organs.\u2019", "abstract": "A study has found that there is a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day.

Melanie Nash, 53, was one of four accused in the plan to open Eddie Nash's vault in Colebrook, then rifle through his casket last May in a scene a prosecutor compared to an Edgar Allan Poe story. Police said she felt she was shorted in her share of the inheritance after her father died in 2004. They didn't find a will in the casket. Plot: Melanie Nash (left), 52, is pleaded guilty to conspiring to remove her father Eddie's remains from Colebrook Village Cemetery in New Hampshire in May of last year. Mr Nash (right) died of a heart attack in 2005. Ransacked: The vault of Mr Nash was found cracked with the casket opened and his remains ransacked. His body was left intact. Nash, who faced trial in March, instead agreed to plead guilty to charges of criminal mischief, interference with a cemetery, conspiracy and abuse of a corpse on Monday. Her sentencing is scheduled for May 5. Two others pleaded guilty; a third person was acquitted. Melanie Nash told police: 'All this was done for the right reasons and I know my father would be OK with it' Nash told police she did not receive anything when her father died and had been thinking of digging up the grave for years to prove that her sister, Susie Nash, 'hid the will.' Susie Nash has said there was only one will when her father's estate plan was done in 1995 and everyone involved knew about it. In a written statement to police last June, Melanie Nash wrote that she met up with the others to go to the cemetery. She wrote: 'All this was done for the right reasons and I know my father would be OK with it.' She ended her statement with: 'What we all did was to dig up my father's coffin, Eddie Nash, looking for documents. We did it with respect.' However, after ransacking her father's remains, Nash found only a packet of cigarettes in his hand, a police affidavit said. 'You hear of grave robbing 100, 150 years ago,' Jenkins and Newman Funeral Home Director Michael Pearson told the station WMUR last year. Successful: Mr Nash, a one-time dairy farmer, started a successful heavy equipment business in 1979, still run by his family. 'You don't think of it in 2014.' Her lawyer argued her statements were given before she was informed of her right against self-incrimination.

He bought a 99p tin of John West pilchards from his local corner shop and burst into a William Hill in Ilford, Essex, on 20 December last year. Seager demanded cash and claimed the tin of fish in tomato sauce he had in a black bag was a lethal explosive device, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. 'I've got a bomb,' he told astonished cashier Adeyemi Awomudu, who simply walked off into a secure room at the back of the shop. Seager hurled his fishy snack across the shop in frustration and left. Mr Awomudu had recognised him and Seager was arrested shortly afterwards, confessing to his bungled plan immediately at the police station. He admitted attempted robbery and one count of communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Edward Franklin, prosecuting, said: 'In respect of the bomb hoax, this wasn't a classic bomb hoax in that the security services weren't alerted and there's no evidence that any action was taken by the authorities. 'Both my learned friend and I agree that this is best dealt with as an attempted robbery - you can say you have a knife or a gun, in this case it was a tin of pilchards masquerading as a bomb.' Judge Karl King remarked: 'The thing that moved the man behind the counter to go behind the safe and into the secure room was undoubtedly the belief that the defendant had a bomb.' Caroline Carberry, defending, said Seager he had been suffering from diagnosed but untreated depression and psychosis at the time of the incident, and has Tourette's Syndrome. 'These are serious offences and I accept the custody threshold has been passed, and normally these types of offences would merit an immediate sentence of imprisonment.' She continued: 'He's far from someone who fits the profile of a robber of a small business, it's a great irony that Rory Seager went into a bookmaker somewhere he frequented, somewhere he was known - he knew the man behind the counter.' She added that Seager's own mother also works at a bookies, and the fact that he chose to rob a similar premises to his mother's indicated he 'hadn't given it much thought'. In a letter to the judge, Seager wrote: 'I just want the judge to know I need help and I will be an outstanding member of my community.' Ms Carberry added: 'This was entirely out of character, this was an aberration in this young man's life.' Seager was attempting to rob the William Hill in Ilford (pictured), which he had frequented as a customer. Sentencing Seager to a two-year suspended sentence, two year's supervision by the probation service and ordering him to undergo mental health treatment, Judge King said: 'There can be absolutely no doubt that what you did was to commit a very serious offence.' The court heard Seager threw the tin of pilchards across the shop in frustration when his plan to pretend it was a bomb failed. He added: 'One can only imagine how petrified he must have been. 'You secreted this item in a black bag, no doubt to give it a more convincing air to what you were doing.' He continued: 'You are young man suffering from a number of psychological conditions that had gone untreated, but you had got to the age of 18 without having descended into criminal activity. 'The disorders from which you suffered were long standing disorders and one can only commend members of your family for being able to cope for so long. 'It is in that context I have to decide how I want to deal with you, I'm satisfied that the custody threshold has been passed - what I am about to do is exceptional and does not reduce the gravity of your offence you committed. 'I am persuaded that I can suspend the sentence.' Judge King also barred him from an betting shop for the next 12 months and ordered him to pay a \u00a3100 surcharge. Seager, of Ilford, wiped away tears as his sentence was read out and thanked the judge before leaving the dock. One of Seager's family members shouted 'You are a just and a fair man your honour' as the judge left the bench.", "abstract": "An 18-year-old man, Rory Seager, attempted to rob a bookmaker's shop in Ilford, Essex, with a tin of pilchards, claiming it was a bomb.

{"article": "One of the British twin sisters who have travelled to Syria to become jihadi brides was caught looking at an extremist-linked image on her school computer six months before she fled the country, it has emerged. Salma Halane, 17, downloaded a photograph of ISIS fighters in December 2013, using a computer at Connell Sixth Form College in Manchester. When teachers found out, she told them she was trying to find her brother who had gone to Syria. Terror: Salma Halane, left, looked up an image of ISIS fighters online six months before she travelled to Syria with her twin sister Zahra, right. Six months later, Salma and her twin sister Zahra fled to the war-torn country, where they are believed to have married jihadist fighters from the bloodthirsty terror group. The ISIS-related photograph which Salma viewed online was spotted by teachers when they were reviewing pupils' internet usage. The school says that she was twice spoken to by staff about the picture, and advised to talk to her family about her worries over her brother, while teachers subsequently discussed the issue with her parents. However, staff did not  tell the police of any concerns about the girl. After the twins disappeared in June last year, the school handed all their internet browsing records over to anti-terrorism investigators to help them track Salma and Zahra down. School: Connell Sixth Form College discovered the image on one of its own computers. Jihad: This picture of female ISIS fighters was shared by Salma on her Twitter feed after she went to Syria. A spokesman for Bright Futures Educational Trust, which runs the college, said there was no reason not to believe Salma's explanation for why she was viewing the image. She added: 'As part of the college's daily routine we review all internet browsing records. We promptly challenge students on anything that stands out during that review. 'In December 2013 we discovered that Salma Halane had viewed an image on a mainstream news website in the hope of spotting her missing brother. Our priority was her emotional wellbeing, and we recommended she speak to her mother about her concern for her brother and the college followed this up. 'Once it became clear that the girls had travelled to Syria, we handed over all computer records to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). These were reviewed and nothing was discovered that caused them concern.' Training: Another image sent out by Salma appears to show women in burqas being taught how to shoot. An education source told the Manchester Evening News that the school should have done more to intervene after they saw that Salma had been looking at terror-related content online. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that if someone at the college had followed this up with Salma, she would still be in this country,' the source said. 'I think there should have been a real concern that she was becoming radicalised.' Salma and Zahra were among the first pupils at Connell Sixth Form College, which opened as a State-funded free school in September 2013. The twin girls, from the Manchester suburb of Chorlton, had 28 GCSEs between them and were hoping to become doctors before they ran away to join ISIS.

Parliamentarians will sit into the night to pass legislation quickly after the Court of Appeal's ruling temporarily makes legal the possession of the party drug, along with benzodiazepines and some so-called head shop drugs. Health minister Leo Varadkar said he is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours. 'We had no way of knowing what the court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility,' he said. The possession of ecstasy is temporarily legal in Ireland because of the knock-on effect caused by a Court of Appeal ruling striking down a ban on\u00a0methylethcathinone. The move was necessary after a decision by the Court of Appeal on a challenge to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The case dealt with the powers of the Government to control substances harmful to human health. The three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone - also known as 4-mec or snow blow - illegal was invalid. Because of the way the laws are drawn up, the ruling had the knock-on effect of temporarily legalising the possession of some other drugs. The Dublin government said the outcome of the case did not affect existing laws on heroin, cocaine or cannabis. While the case dealt with the legality of possession of named substances, their sale and supply remains an offence. 'Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet,' said Mr Varadkar.

{"article": "Teenagers taking GCSE science will no longer have their practical work assessed through coursework, it was confirmed yesterday. The exams regulator Ofqual is pressing ahead with the reform despite fierce opposition from many in the science community. Universities have argued that that those entering undergraduate courses needed tried and tested basic skills to study at a higher level. GCSE science students will no longer have practical work assessed through coursework. Pictured, David Cameron and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan watch a science experiment at a school earlier this month. Education Nicky Morgan has also publicly criticised the move, recently saying it was \u2018in danger of holding back the next generation of scientists.\u2019 But Ofqual has insisted that the change will \u2018liberate\u2019 teachers from repetitive practicals and offer more variety to pupils. Under the proposals, there will be no separate exam specifically covering the lab work students have done, but instead there will be written exam questions that will draw on what students have learnt. This will count for at least 15 per cent of the total marks available. Each exam board offering science GCSEs will have to specify a minimum number of practical experiments a pupil must take part in and this number will be no less than eight in each individual science and 16 for combined science courses. The move means that practical science will no longer be assessed through \u2018controlled assessment\u2019 - a type of coursework completed in the classroom. Education Nicky Morgan has criticised the move, saying it was \u2018in danger of holding back the next generation of scientists\u2019 Schools will also have to confirm that students have completed a range of experiments and each pupil will have to keep a record of their work. Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey said: \u2018There is unanimous agreement among scientists that practical work is central to good science qualifications. \u2018We have consulted widely and have identified a new approach to the assessment of practical science that will liberate teachers to offer a wider variety of classroom experimentation and promote effective student progression to further study or employment.\u2019 A document on the plans says that students who do not do practical work will still be able to achieve science GCSEs, but insists that these young people \u2018are likely to find it challenging to achieve the highest grades without having the relevant practical experience\u2019. Confirmation of the changes comes in the wake of strong opposition to a similar overhaul of A-level science. Morgan\u2019s criticism will be the first major test of Ofqual\u2019s independence after it was set up in 2010 as a non-ministerial government department. Mrs Morgan said in a letter to Ofqual yesterday that while she appreciated the \u2018reasoning\u2019, she still harboured reservations. She wrote: \u2018I continue to share the concerns of many in the science community that not having an assessment of practicals as part of the GCSE risks undermining the teaching of practicals in schools. \u2018It is important you take all possible steps to mitigate that risk.\u2019 She called for the situation to be monitored to ensure that pupils are still undertaking a range of practical activities. She added: \u2018I would also expect \u2013 as I am sure you are planning \u2013 arrangements to be put in place to evaluate the impact of the approach when it is implemented in schools: with a commitment to revisit the decision if the evidence shows the approach to have had a detrimental effect.\u2019", "abstract": "GCSE science students in the UK will no longer have practical work assessed through coursework, according to exams regulator Ofqual.

{"article": "President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' Attorney General Eric Holder has openly endorsed automatic voter registration, adopted two days ago by Oregon, the first American state to officially embrace the measure, but Obama had not made his support for either that or compulsory voting clearly known until today. President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. The president said the people in America who 'tend not to vote' are usually younger, of lower income and skew toward 'immigrant groups' and minority groups. 'And they're often the folks who are scratchin' and climbin' to get into the middle class,' he said, 'and they're working hard.' 'There's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls,' he said. 'We should wanna get them into the polls.' The remark as a subtle reference to Republican efforts at the state level to pass legislation that would require registered voters to prove that they are who they say that they are at the polls with a government-issued photo identification card. Republicans say that such measures prevent voter fraud. Democrats claim that they stop legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the electoral process. Many Democrats believe that's the point of the laws - to keep groups that traditionally vote Democrat, especially minorities, from casting a ballot - and have characterized voter ID laws as racist for that reason. Requiring the elderly, who sometimes don't drive, and minorities, who when they live in major cities often take public transportation, as well as the low-income sector of society, which can't afford always afford government identification cards, is a modern day poll tax, Democrats have argued. Supporters of the photo ID laws have tried to assuage their concerns by setting aside funds for government-funded ids and offering free rides to the DMV in certain states. Obama's Department of Justice has taken many of the states that have passed such laws to court, with the notable exception of Virginia, which put in place processes to counteract the hardship that the new requirement places on certain individuals. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' The president is seen here mingling with guests of the event at The City Club of Cleveland. Conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration for many of the same reasons they believe states should adopt stricter regulations at the polls. In Oregon, also the first state in the U.S.to conduct its elections entirely by mail-in ballot, Republicans worry that the mass distribution of millions of ballots by mail, which can easily be tampered with in residential areas, creates an opening for new instances of voter fraud. Millions of ballots will be sent out and the state has little control over where they end up. The cost of implementing the law is also of concern, as the system will ensure that every Oregon resident receives a ballot unless they opt-out. There's also the question of where the DMV can ensure that the personal information it will use to pre-register voters and contact them will remain private. Automatic registration is popular in foreign countries, including Sweden, Argentina and Canada, where it has helped bring the voter participation rate up above 90 percent but remains controversial domestically. Comparatively, just over half the U.S. population regularly votes. Roughly 56 percent of eligible Americans cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. Australia, which enforces mandatory voting, has a 100 percent rate of participation. President Barack Obama tours Magnet at Cleveland State University before his speech on Wednesday afternoon. Obama brought up the topic of compulsory voting while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics. Speaking at the The City Club of Cleveland today, Obama brought the subject up on his own while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics. 'I don't think I've ever said this publicly, but I'm going to say it now,' Obama said, before bringing up compulsory voting.

{"article": "Fall River, Massachusetts  (CNN)Shayanna Jenkins, the fiancee of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, revealed for the first time Monday she suspects marijuana was in a box she was instructed to remove from the couple's home the day after the slaying of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, the boyfriend of Shayanna Jenkins' sister and semipro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. Hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. For the first time, Shayanna Jenkins told jurors on Monday the box smelled \"skunky,\" making her think it was marijuana. Her new description came during cross-examination. Earlier, she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box, said Hernandez never told her, nor did she look. Jenkins testified Friday that on the day after Lloyd's slaying, her fiance called her with instructions that it was important to discard the box.  On Monday, she described his tone as \"normal\" when he made the request and said she had never been asked by prosecutors what she thought the box smelled like. \"Were you ever asked what you thought was in the box?\" asked Hernandez lawyer Charles Rankin about her previous testimony to the grand jury. \"Never,\" said Jenkins. \"Were you ever asked if it had any smell to it?\" he asked. \"Never,\" she replied. Jenkins' revelation contradicts the prosecution's previous suspicion that the weapon used in the slaying was in the box. No weapon in the case has been recovered. Home surveillance video played inside the courtroom Monday showed  Shayanna Jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister's car. At the time, Shaneah Jenkins had been at her home grieving over the death of her boyfriend. Shaneah Jenkins was present in court on Monday and cried while listening to the testimony and watching the video of her sister Shayanna carrying the trash bag. The two sisters now barely speak to each other. Shaneah Jenkins sits next to Lloyd's mother in the courtroom on the opposite side of Hernandez's defense team. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Shayanna Jenkins said she disposed of it at a location she cannot remember. \"I found a random dumpster, and put it in there,\" she told Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley. When questioned about her inability to remember the dumpster's location and other details, Shayanna Jenkins said she had been unsettled at the time. \"I was nervous. I had to comfort my sister. Everyone's emotions were on me, and it was a form of breaking down at that point,\" she said. On Monday, Shayanna Jenkins was asked about what she called  an \"on-again, off-again\" relationship with Hernandez, her high school sweetheart. She recalled spending time apart from Hernandez after discovering evidence of infidelity on Hernandez's phone. She told the court that before getting back together with him, she had to make a difficult choice about her future with the football star. \"I made a decision that if I was going to move back in with Aaron, I would need to compromise with his behavior, including his infidelity,\" she told the courtroom and then started to cry. After Hernandez proposed in October 2012, Jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity. Jenkins admitted giving some different answers during her grand jury testimony, in part, she said because of confusing questions by prosecutors. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. This week, the jury is expected to hear from Alexander Bradley, Hernandez's former right hand man, who has accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face in February of 2013. However, a judge has barred him from discussing that. Bradley is jailed in an unrelated shooting. The trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

{"article": "Evicence: Police commander David Duckenfield, 70, pictured today, has denied claims he helped cook up a conspiracy to conceal police failings after Hillsborough. The commander in charge at Hillsborough said today he was not behind a police conspiracy to cover up their  part in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans. David Duckenfield, 70, has admitted his failure to close a tunnel caused dozens of deaths but denied claims he then helped conceal\u00a0'very serious professional failings'. The retired chief superintendent from South Yorkshire Police spoke out as he gave evidence for a seventh day at the hearing in Warrington. He admitted that as the man in charge on April 15 1989 'the buck stops with me', but said he was inexperienced and had inherited a safety plan from the previous year. Defence barrister John Beggs QC asked him: 'It has been suggested by some of the barristers sitting in front of me there was some conspiracy to interfere with a fair collection of evidence. Did you have any part in that?' Duckenfield said: 'None at all, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'Did you know anything about it?' Duckenfield replied: 'I did not'. Mr Beggs asked: 'Did you at any stage even encourage any other police officer or police civilians to change his or her statement?' He said: 'No, sir.' Mr Beggs went on: 'Did you change the content of the statement that the jury know was made by you on or before May 3 1989?' He said: 'No, sir.' Mr Beggs said: 'Did anyone ever ask you to change your statement?' He said: 'No, sir.' He confirmed he had no role in the subsequent investigation by West Midlands Police into the tragedy and had no part either in the direction of the force's case at Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. Mr Beggs said it had been suggested by a number of barristers at the inquests that Mr Duckenfield alone should bear responsibility for the tragedy. Mr Duckenfield agreed he had nothing to do with previous turnstile 'failures' at Sheffield Wednesday and no one had advised him about them. He had no say on Liverpool being awarded the smaller end of the ground for the match with just 23 turnstiles. In reality, he had 'inherited' the police operation for the match. He also had nothing to do with signage at the ground or previous decisions to install perimeter fences and radial fences, its architectural features or any breaches of stadium safety guidance on crush barrier heights. Mr Beggs asked: 'If supporters turned up later in 1989 than in 1988, for whatever reason, was that something with which you had any control?' 'No sir,'said Mr Duckenfield. Admissions: David Duckenfield, sketched giving evidence for a seventh day,  admitted he 'froze' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion. Tragedy: 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace in 1989. Yesterday Duckenfield, 70, said his decisions were a 'direct cause' of the 96 deaths and claimed he 'froze' as the disaster unfolded. He also admitted being unfamiliar with the layout of the Sheffield Wednesday ground and said the FA Cup semi-final in 1989 was his first time in charge of a match. During questioning by Paul Greaney QC, for the Police Federation, he admitted he had caused the deaths of the fans. Mr Duckenfield, who retired in 1991, accepted he 'froze' before ordering the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the Leppings Lane turnstile. But 2,000 fans then entered Gate C, with many heading straight for the tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. He said 'yes sir' when asked if the fatal crush would have been avoided if he had closed this tunnel which led to the already packed central terrace pens. Mr Greaney then asked if he had failed to recognise he needed to close the tunnel and Mr Duckenfield again agreed. The inquests continue.

{"article": "It is known to prevent against heart disease and is hailed as the secret to a long, healthy life. Now, researchers have found the Mediterranean diet can help people with depression, too. A study found people who followed the diet were happier, less stressed and reported an improved quality of life compared to those who ate fewer Mediterranean foods. The researchers said omega-3 in particular, a fatty acid found in fish, plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability. The diet consists of plant-based foods such as vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, seeds and olives, extra virgin olive oil, fish, with moderate red wine intake. It also involves a low consumption of processed food, processed carbohydrates, sweets and chocolate and red meat. Omega-3, a fatty acid found in fish, plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability. As part of the study, Australian researchers recruited a total of 82 adults with depression, aged between 18 -65. They assessed their mental health and quality of life using two official scales: the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). They then assessed how strongly they followed the Mediterranean diet through a 14-item questionnaire. The study\u2019s lead author, Dr Natalie Parletta, of the University of South Australia, said there was a strong link between the Mediterranean diet and lower scores for mental illness. This was despite the fact it was a study of people with depression, who tended to have poor diets in the first place. She told MailOnline: \u2018What we found is that poor diet is predicting the onset of depression. \u2018It\u2019s not that people are getting depressed and then eating badly, eating badly causes the depression in the first place. \u2018We recruited people who had depression already. We screened out people who had good diet. \u2018So it was amazing that there was a significant correlation the Mediterranean diet and mental illness, even for people with low scores on the consumption of wholefoods.\u2019 She said research shows there is an overlap between heart disease and depression, and scientists have begun to think there might be common underlying mechanisms. Inflammation and insulin resistance which occurs in the body and causes heart disease could also cause depression in the brain, she said. \u2018The brain is an organ like any other,\u2019 she explained. \u2018It has higher needs than other organs, from bloodflow to delivering oxygen, glucose and nutrients. \u2018A lack of bloodflow and inflammation can affect the brain as much as any other organ. A Mediterranean diet is high in nutrients such as omega-3, vitamin B, vitamin D, healthy fats and anti-oxidants, she said, which are all important for keeping the brain functioning well and staving off mental illness. Sometimes depression is 'biological', the researchers said. It can be a deficiency in some of the nutrients that keep the brain functioning properly. There has been a lot of research on how omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, play a vital role in maintaining or improving mental health and stability. Deficiency in these nutrients can impair the brain\u2019s functioning and lead to depression, she added. She said: \u2018There are many challenges in life, and factors that lead to depression. But by developing a strong foundation for our brain to function well through providing it with key nutrients, we\u2019re better able to deal with life\u2019s challenges. \u2018And it\u2019s not just the nutrients - the fibre is also beneficial. Highly fibrous foods means you\u2019re not getting mood swings through sugar. She continued: \u2018Sometimes depression is biological. It could be a wheat allergy, it\u2019s rarely known that an intolerance can lead to depression and even bipolar. \u2018Depending on the person, a deficiency could be the key link to what is causing mental illness.\u2019 On the other hand, a poor diet can lead to depression, stress and anxiety, she said. She explained hat highly processed foods, red meat and confectionary increase our blood glucose levels, leading to sensitivity to insulin \u2013 the hormone that controls how much sugar is in our blood \u2013 and obesity. This inflammation affects the brain, causing mental illness. When the body is stressed or anxious, it goes into fight or flight mode which shuts down digestion and healing.

{"article": "New research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who can't eat the  grain, an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten-free foods is booming. The Kansas Wheat Commission is spending $200,000 for the first two years of the project, which is meant to identify everything in wheat's DNA sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease. The disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous, complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine. Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry, said funding research to breed gluten-free wheat is 'the right thing to do' The only known treatment known is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. Though celiac disease is four-to-five times more common now than 50 years ago, only about one per cent of the world's population is believed to suffer from it, and just a fraction have been diagnosed. But the gluten-free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years, driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten-free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it's somehow healthier. Sales of gluten-free snacks, crackers, pasta, bread and other products reached $973million in the United States in 2014, up from $810million the previous year, according to a January report by consumer research firm Packaged Facts. The research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten-free products and brands at supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Supporters of the Kansas research, though, say this isn't a way to regain market share. Miller shows a flour solution from a specific strain of wheat at a research facility in the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. The only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. The research for gluten-free wheat began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. It is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain. 'If you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people, then it's the right thing to do,' according to the project's lead researcher, Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry. Gluten-free foods are a niche product, and in the broader context of the world's wheat markets, it is not a driving factor, according to Dan O'Brien, extension grain market specialist at Kansas State University. 'I anticipate it will develop as a specialty market,' Miller said.The research, which began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is still in its early stages, with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat. Miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions. He also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties, and will tap into a Kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers. Researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten-free wheat using traditional breeding methods. Miller's methodology might be 'too simplistic an approach' that wouldn't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction, according to Armin Alaedini, assistant professor of medical sciences at Columbia University and a researcher at the New York-based school's Celiac Disease Center. Miller (pictured) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains. Researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten-free wheat. Alaedini, after looking at Miller's plan online, said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that isn't completely safe for all celiac disease patients. 'After all this effort, this product that is coming out... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten-free products that are already on the market,' Alaedini said. The medical advisory board for the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit based in Woodland Hills, California, could not reach a consensus on the viability of Miller's research. But the organization's CEO, Marilyn Geller, is encouraged. Her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15, Geller said, and his father also was later diagnosed.

{"article": "His nine-year career at Arsenal has been an emotional and physical roller coaster. Often showing glimpses that he is the perfect mix of power and guile his manager craves before spending weeks, or even years, in the treatment room, Arsene Wenger now looks set to release this French midfielder at the end of his contract in June. The ride is coming to an end. 1554 days, 222 weeks, over four years out injured. The numbers aren't as pretty as his playing style can be. This is the curious case of Abou Vassiriki Diaby. Abou Diaby poses with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger upon his signing in January 2006. Diaby challenges Bolton's Matt Jansen (C) during a 1-1 draw at Highbury in 2006. Diaby sits on the first of the 60,000 seats to be installed at the Emirates Stadium before Arsenal moved in. Diaby beats Sunderland's Tommy Miller (right) during a match at the Stadium of Light in May 2006. 3339 days at club. 1554 days injured. 46.5% injured. When Diaby arrived in the Premier League on January 13, 2006, Arsenal beat off competition from Chelsea and Jose Mourinho to sign the 19-year-old from Auxerre. Comparisons were already drawn to club legend and former captain Patrick Vieira because of his height, intensity and technique on the ball. 'Diaby is a bit more offensive than Vieira but when he plays a more defensive role he is very similar,' Wenger said. He started off well, scoring his first goal for the Gunners in April against Aston Villa, but his debut half-season in north London ended in despair. Diaby was the victim of an 'assassins tackle' from Sunderland youngster Dan Smith - according to Wenger - his sickening scream as he fractured his ankle at the Stadium of Light must still be heard by the boss. All 42 of Diaby's injuries since he joined Arsenal in January 2006.

He has clocked up 42 injuries during his Arsenal career,\u00a0according to data from physioroom, averaging a new setback every 80 days. The Gunners have played 350 league games since his arrival but Diaby has featured in just 35 per cent of them. Despite his struggles, his almost constant spell on the sidelines hasn't been short of its positive moments. In early 2012 Diaby came back into the Arsenal team to feature alongside Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla and impressed, even scoring on his return to the French national team.

{"article": "Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's own words may determine whether he lives or dies, even if he never speaks a word at his trial. The admitted Boston Marathon bomber has sat in silence as people who lost limbs sobbed or glared at him from the witness stand. He slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail-packed pressure cooker bombs exploded, killing three people, claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others. He didn't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court. At issue: Was Tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the United States for policies he believed were harmful to Muslims? Or, was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older, more radical brother? The defense team tried to portray Tsarnaev as a confused college kid who, like countless others, watches Comedy Central and cracks crass jokes. \"I wanna study a broad or two,\" he posted on his Twitter account as @J_tsar. He jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the Trix rabbit, and about \"whale watching\" outside a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. Miriam Conrad, a member of his defense team, tried Tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would-be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise. His brother was dead and police knew who he was; they were scouring the Boston suburb of Watertown for Tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the Slip Away II, a fishing boat dry-docked in a Watertown backyard. He hid for hours before being discovered. Bleeding, he picked up a pencil and wrote what Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb called his \"manifesto.\" Tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother, Tamerlan, had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police. The indictment against him says Tsarnaev helped in his brother's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police. About the bombings, Tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he didn't enjoy killing innocent civilians, but that circumstances excused it. \"The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that,\" he wrote. \"Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it.\" Streaks of blood cover portions of his message. More than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words. So ended one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history. While in the boat, he wrote that he couldn't stand to see the U.S. government \"go unpunished\" for killing Muslims. \"We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" He ended with: \"Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said \" -- the word was lost to a bullet hole  -- \"it is allowed.\" Tsarnaev's connections: Who's who. Judge George O'Toole viewed the boat Tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat \"in context\" to the jury. He turned down requests by the media to accompany him. The defense said the government only presented about 45 tweets out of about 1,100. Many were benign, about girls, cars and food as well as sleeping and disliking studying, the defense argued. On Monday, FBI agent Steven Kimball testified about two Twitter accounts used by Tsarnaev. One account shows he tweeted on the day of the April 15, 2013, bombing:. \"Ain't no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people\" His last tweet was on April 17. He sent it while on the run:. \"I'm a stress free kind of guy\" His other account carried seven tweets, including this:. \"strive to be a better muslim, be greedy with your time, devote most of it to the Almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need #islam\" The jury also has now seen Tsarnaev in videos, trailing his brother onto Boylston Street. Both carried heavy backpacks. He paused for four minutes, standing next to a tree in front of the Forum restaurant. In front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race. He put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath. When his brother's bomb went off a block away, heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise.

'In games like this sometimes in that opening 20 minutes, if you can get the first goal, it opens the game up. 'Adam Lallana's one looked a clear penalty. The defender is recovering back in, but he's on the wrong side and he can't get to the ball, so for me, that was a penalty. 'You could argue when [Rudy] Gestede handballs it off the header from the free-kick, we could have had another penalty, and sometimes you need that little bit of luck. 'They have got some good players - Gestede gives you a problem up front - but I thought in the main, we dealt with that really, really well. 'I thought maybe the sharpness was just missing from our game and that wee bit of incision. But credit to the players, they kept a clean sheet and the objective was to be in the hat for the next round by the end of the evening, and that's what we are in.'

Liverpool attacker Adam Lallana (right) was also denied a penalty after tumbling from a challenge by Kilgallon. Gerrard did not play due to injury, but fans are desperate to get to Wembley in his final season at the club. Rovers skipper Matthew Kilgallon was quick to insist the home side did not deserve a penalty for his challenge on dangerman Daniel Sturridge. He said: 'No, no, no, no. You have got to be tight to him. You give him a yard and he's got that shot with no back-lift. Maybe when I did give him that yard, he has got the shot off. 'You have got to be tight to these players and that's what I was.' Things might have been worse for Liverpool had it not been for a fine 49th-minute save by keeper Simon Mignolet to claw Alex Baptiste's header out of the top corner. Baptiste said: 'I was free at the corner.

{"article": "Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spent 21 months since returning to Stamford Bridge trying to mould the team spirit that he craves - and now he seems to have achieved it, labelling his side as a band of 'brothers'. Chelsea ground out a hard-fought 1-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday night and their manager reserved special praise for the togetherness of his players, with John Terry and co embracing at the final whistle before applauding the travelling support.

The Special One also confirmed that his players would be enjoying two days off with a week's gap until they play Paris Saint-Germain in the return of their Champions League last-16 tie. \u2018My team were brothers on the pitch,' Mourinho said. 'That is important if you are to win the most difficult league in the world. I want to sleep now until midday. We could easily have lost two points. \u2018The way West Ham play, nobody is better than them. They are the best at the way they play. It is not just to play football, the pressure, the tension and the emotion, my players were fantastic. \u2018I told the referee is it very difficult to be a ref here, because of the style of their game. Lots of long balls. West Ham had lots of balls in the box, very difficult, very intense and really difficult for the referee. They complain for everything, the crowd is behind them and it is really, really difficult.' The Chelsea players, led by Mourinho (fourth left) leave the pitch at Ewood Park after winning in 2005.

And Mourinho led the plaudits for the playmaker who he has criticised in the past for his work ethic. 'Eden Hazard was fantastic,' he said. 'He is punished by opponents in a very hard way. Not in a violent way, just an aggressive football way because they tried to stop him but the kid is playing, scoring and defending.' But the Portuguese coach was less impressed with the rescheduling of Chelsea's game against Leicester, which could have been held this weekend with both clubs out of the FA Cup but will instead take place on April 9. \u2018It is not a good thing that we play Leicester in two months now - that\u2019s not a good thing, for someone in the title race to have played one match less,' he said.

{"article": "Imagine playing a game of Pictionary with a group of Oxford University students who are unable to recognise the Taj Mahal, the Pyramids or the Eiffel Tower. Welcome to the parallel universe of North Korea, where some of the hermit kingdom's brightest young minds have a lack of worldly knowledge which would shame a Western primary school student. In 2011 writer and journalist Suki Kim went undercover for two terms teaching English at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, just outside the capital of the world's most secretive country. Scroll down for video. Suki Kim (left), arrived for her first term in North Korea in July 2011 and left at the end of her second shortly after the country's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il (right), died in December of that year. Students at the\u00a0Pyongyang University of Science and Technology doing their mandatory morning exercises. Miss Kim taking a class. One student once asked her if it was true everyone in the world spoke Korean. Portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il hang on the wall above the blackboard. Posing as one of the Christian missionaries running the facility, Miss Kim spent months secretly documenting her experiences for a book, 'Without You, There Is No Us: My secret life teaching the sons of North Korea's elite'. The 270 boys aged 19-20 were the offspring of some of the regime's most loyal citizens - some of the few allowed to live in the capital outside of which the vast majority are stuck in grinding poverty in the countryside. Their new teacher was getting up at 5am every day to write-up notes she had taken on her experiences, making sure she copied everything to five USB sticks and left nothing on her laptop which could be spied on by her hosts. If Miss Kim, then aged 40, had been caught, she risked being branded a spy and being thrown in one of North Korea's gulags, or forced labour camps, where 120,000 political prisoners are thought to be held. Every piece of material for every lesson had to be submitted and approved for use by a shadowy group known as the 'counterparts' - North Korean staff overseeing the lessons of the foreign teachers who had been brought in.

And yet, for North Korea's best and brightest, 'photos of the United Nations, the Taj Mahal and the Great Pyramids of Giza elicited only blank expressions'. They knew about Bill Gates from their previous universities, but had no idea how Mark Zuckerberg and the website he created, Facebook, had revolutionised the way the rest of the world communicated. Miss Kim wrote: 'A few guessed the names of the Eiffel Tower and Stonehenge, but only after much hemming and hawing. 'Hardly anyone knew what country had first landed men on the moon, despite the fact that they were science and technology majors. 'Asked what year computers had been invented, most had no idea; it was only after much consultation that one team ventured a guess: 1870.' Miss Kim told MailOnline: 'In a way, why would they know? They have never been taught about the outside world. Three uniformed students on guard duty outside the IT building.

'But on another level they were the elite. If any of them did know more the fear and the consequences of being exposed were so great they never let it be known.' One student asked Miss Kim if it were true that everyone in the world spoke Korean, as it was'so superior that they spoke it in England, China and America.' Many of the boy's families lived as little as 10 minutes drive away in Pyongyang, but they were hardly ever allowed to see them or have any contact at all during term time. One student's father stopped by the campus to see him but was turned away and all he could do was leave a note.

{"article": "A woman has been found guilty of shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, faces at least seven years in prison after being convicted of firing a 9mm handgun through the restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan in the early hours of February 9, 2014. No one was hurt in the incident. In court on Wednesday, she was charged with felony use of firearm, carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm into an occupied building. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, pictured in the courtroom as she was convicted of opening fire on a McDonald's in February 2014 after they got her order wrong. Torres's mother reacts to the guilty verdict for her daughter on all charges related to the gun-firing at the fast food chain. She looks toward the jury as she hears that she has been found guilty. Torres could face at least seven years in prison. During court, the jury heard the in-car recording taken from the police vehicle located outside of her home while she was being interrogated after the shooting. The recording captured Torres saying 'there was no reason' for why it happened, according to\u00a0Mlive. She also said 'it was just dumb'. Torres explained that she was not seeking to shoot anyone while at the fast-food restaurant, and that she legally owned the gun, but did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The charge against Torres for felony use a firearm carries at least two years in prison, while shooting at an occupied building and illegally carrying a concealed weapon carries up to five years. Torres, pictured left in her mug shot, miraculously did not injure anyone. She will appear in court on April 21 for her sentencing. A news report from February 2014 shows the window Torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside. During the first day of trial, her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally. The gun used during the incident that could have  injured an employee who was tending to Torres. On the day before the incident, Torres had gone to McDonald's for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it, as she had requested, police said. After speaking to the managers, they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit, police said, and  after drinking at clubs with a friend that night, she took them up on their offer. Sitting in the passenger seat, she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number, which later helped police track her down. But when she and her friend received their order, she again had no bacon on her burger. Nydia Ray, who was driving the car during the incident, is pictured testifying in court during the first day of trial on March 24, 2015. The server on the night of the incident, Essence Lake, testified in court on March 24, 2015. She said the bullet could have struck her if she had still been by the window. Torres pulled out a handgun and fired once, sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant, police said. Her attorney, John Beason, had previously said in court that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally. Torres' friend, Nydia Ray, who was driving the car, told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger. She said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying 'What the f*** is going on?' when it fired. The server, Essence Lake, had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass, she said, adding the bullet would have struck her if she had still been by the window. 'We went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off,' Ray said. Torres' attorney, John Beason, said that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally. She said she was not looking to shoot anyone at McDonald's and that she legally owned the gun. The women went to Ray's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number. Police tracked the women down 30 minutes later. Grand Rapids Police Officer Patrick Loeb said Ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order. She told him Torres said something along the lines of 'do you know who you're talking to?' before she fired - which Ray has since denied. Torres will appear in court on April 21 for sentencing and remains free on a $50,000 bond. Torres was found soon after speeding away from the Grand Rapids McDonald's (pictured) because she had given her number to the restaurant's manager as she flirted with him before the shooting.", "abstract": "A woman in Michigan has been found guilty of shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours.

{"article": "A Virginia lawmaker who was jailed over a sex scandal with his 17-year-old receptionist has announced that she has given birth to a baby boy. Delegate Joseph Morrissey, 57, told The Richmond Times-Dispatch\u00a0on Sunday that Myrna Pride, now 18, had delivered 'a beautiful, healthy 7 lb. 8 oz. baby boy' in Georgia. 'I was with Myrna and she is absolutely thrilled\u2026 I am too!' he told the paper, which added that there was no information on the baby's father. Morrissey, who was re-elected from behind bars in January, was released from jail last week after completing a sentence for a misdemeanor relating to the sex scandal, which emerged last summer. Sex scandal: Joe Morrissey, pictured in January, has announced a teenager with whom he is accused of having sex has given birth to a healthy boy. He pleaded no contest to the charges last year. To avoid a trial, he had pleaded no contest in December 2014 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor in a sex scandal involving the then-17-year-old girl. The plea\u00a0allowed him to avoid potentially decades behind bars. He had been accused of having sex with the teenager in his law offices - where she worked - and of possessing a naked photo of her, which he also sent to a friend. Their alleged relationship emerged after Pride's sisters and father found a nude photo and sexually explicit messages on her phone. They\u00a0tracked Morrissey and Pride from a restaurant one night in August 2013, and then called police, who found the teenager inside his home at midnight. Morrissey, a bachelor who has fathered three children with three different women, has denied having sex with the teenager. She has also denied the relationship. Morrissey claimed that Pride came to his home that night in August 2013 not to have sex, but to get his legal help recovering child support from her father, Coleman Pride. Then earlier this year, he was indicted on four new felony charges for allegedly forging a document relating to payments Pride's father owed her. Morrissey allegedly vouched for the document in court and persuaded the girl's mother to swear to its authenticity as well. Behind bars: Morrissey is seen leaving jail in Barhamsville, Virginia on work release in January. He was released last week but now faces four felony charges over allegations he forged court documents. The document had been presented in court to support his version of events from the night the girl was found inside his home. It appeared to be a court order showing that Coleman Pride, Myrna's father, had agreed to pay $50 a month into a college fund for his daughter. But prosecutors said there is no court record of any child support order, and that the document 'appears to be a fabrication'. Charges: Deirdre Warren (pictured) is also accused of swearing the documents were authentic. Myrna's mother, Deidre Warren, was also indicted on perjury and forgery charges. Morrissey faces up to 10 years on each count if convicted. He is preparing for a trial on the charges and Pride, who will turn 19 later this month, has appeared at his recent hearings, the Times-Dispatch reported. Morrissey, an attorney known as 'Fighting Joe' since his 1993 courthouse fistfight with another lawyer, said earlier this year that the charges are false and he vowed to beat them. 'This is a very harmful and mean-spirited blow, but I'll do what I've always done. I'll prevail,' he said. After his conviction, the four-term Democrat announced his resignation under pressure from his colleagues but angered them by running as an independent in the special election called to choose his successor. He won the election in January. That month, the Associated Press reported that his colleagues largely ignore him. House Speaker William J. Howell stripped Morrissey of his committee assignments, and legislative leaders from both parties are debating whether to censure or expel him. 'This is a truly painful and embarrassing chapter for the oldest continuously operating legislative body in the New World,' Howell said after learning of the new charges. 'The House will evaluate these new indictments as it pertains to disciplinary action.'", "abstract": "Virginia lawmaker, Joseph Morrissey, who was jailed over a sex scandal with his 17-year-old receptionist, has announced that she has given birth to a baby boy.

Mother-of-four April moved into a flat near the family home, but Michael continued to comfort eat \u2013 it was then he had gastric sleeve surgery and finally managed to ditch the pounds and win back his family. April said: \u2018I was scared it was putting his life at risk and he\u2019d miss our boys grow up. I told him I was moving me and the boys out. I didn\u2019t want them to see him this way. \u2018He had to pick the kebabs or his kids \u2013 keep gaining weight and lose us or diet and put his family first.\u2019 In a bid to win back his family, Michael swapped fatty foods for salads, pasta and fish dishes and kept a food diary. Michael continued to see his sons every weekend, and April rang his mother Janet Wareing regularly to find out his progress. Thw family can all now enjoy days out together. Miss Roy says that the gastric sleeve surgery was a lifesaver: 'I couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.' Mr Wareing couldn't go out and play with his kids as he would be exhausted after five minutes. April said: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to call Michael too much in case he thought I was nagging him. \u2018Janet told me he was eating healthy and going for walks but he was miserable. When I saw him, he said he was practically starving himself to lose weight for us. \u2018But it wasn\u2019t working and he confessed being alone upset him and he comfort ate.\u2019 April said: \u2018Janet had seen a TV show about weight loss surgery and thought it could help Michael.\u2019 Michael - who has since had another son and a daughter with April - agreed to go to a Phoenix Health weight loss clinic where a consultant talked him through his options. In August 2010, two weeks after Michael\u2019s consultation, he was fitted with a gastric sleeve. The couple started dating in 2003 when they were introduced through Mr Wareing\u2019s brother.

Michael and his sons Liam & Kieren-Lee standing in his trousers he wore when he was fat. Michael pictured with his partner April and new born Kaevy-Anne in hospital.

He loved taking him to the swings or for walks on the beach.\u2019 But in 2005, Mr Wareing became a different person. April said: \u2018He was more reserved and didn\u2019t want to talk about his feelings. I imagined he was missing his other three kids who lived with their mums. \u2018So he comfort ate crisps and chocolate. His favourite takeaway was kebabs with all the trimmings.\u2019 A year later, the couple had their second son Liam, now nine. Michael gained so much weight he struggled to help around the couple\u2019s house and look after their children.

{"article": "Arsenal for the title? That extraordinary possibility cannot now be batted away as pure whimsy after Olivier Giroud\u2019s prolific goal run continued, inspiring his side to overcome Newcastle. This win doesn\u2019t merely cement Arsenal\u2019s top-four place but gives Chelsea and Manchester City above them reason to look over shoulders with increasing concern. Giroud\u2019s goals came within a four-minute first-half spell, the first off his thigh, the second from a header. They take the 28-year-old\u2019s recent tally to nine goals in nine games in all competitions. He also has eight in six games against Newcastle since his \u00a310million move in summer 2012 from Montpellier.

Newcastle were a distant second best in the first half but were impressive after the break, testing Arsenal\u2019s mettle as Moussa Sissoko gave them a consolation. The upshot is Arsenal are just a point behind City and four behind leaders Chelsea, albeit with Chelsea having two games in hand. Chelsea remain odds-on favourites to win the title race. Rightly. But whisper it: this is a race now of sorts, a contest at least, with the season\u2019s biggest prize remaining a feasible for more than one team, for now. \u2018Chelsea at the moment I feel have enough [of a ] cushion to be serene,\u2019 said Arsenal\u2019s manager Arsene Wenger, asked about his side\u2019s title chances. \u2018Chelsea have too much security.\u2019 But asked if his players believe they can now cause what would be an amazing upset, he added: \u2018We are in a fight right until the end. We will keep on fighting.\u2019 Wenger\u2019s counterpart John Carver said: \u2018Until they scored the two goals I thought we were in it. But we conceded from two set plays and that\u2019s disappointing.\u2019 Leaving aside the two-legged exit to Monaco in the Champions League, things have been going Arsenal\u2019s way of late. They have won 14 of their last 16 games, and all six of their last six games. That is title-challenging form and their eight Premier League fixtures to come offer the tantalising opportunity to advance their own cause while damaging those immediately around them.

Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry. Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about 3\u00bd hours of deliberation. Garrard's husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing. Garrard is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday. Jurors will hear additional testimony and make a decision on whether to recommend life without parole or death. The final decision is up to the judge. Authorities claimed the 49-year-old woman forced Savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy. Savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital. The defense denied the woman meant the girl any harm, but jurors rejected that claim. Garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse. Garrard testified that the girl did run, but only as practice for races at school. Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson. Garrard walks to the Etowah County Judicial Building on Friday to prepare for a hearing. She now faces the death penalty or life without parole. Assistant District Attorney Carol Griffith said Garrard killed the child intentionally by berating her and making her run around the yard picking up sticks. 'She was tortured,' Griffith said. Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department. Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said. But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day. The 49-year-old walks in handcuffs around her feet, waist and arms, accompanied by two officers. He said, 'I think we have all had the thought: \"If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'' He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support. 'Then it becomes \"Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell\",' he said. Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon. Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence. Savannah's stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin has also been charged with her murder, which carries a life sentence. The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth while in custody in February 2012. A 911 operator told the court Garrard asked 'for a smoke' while the girl was unconscious outside their home.", "abstract": "Joyce Hardin Garrard has been found guilty of capital murder after making her 9-year-old granddaughter run for three hours as punishment, causing her to collapse and die.

{"article": "A 15-year-old north Florida girl who authorities say fatally shot her 16-year-old brother after years of abuse at home pleaded no contest on Thursday to felony burglary and will receive probation and counseling. The girl's probation will last until her 19th birthday, and is contingent upon her participation in counseling, and testifying truthfully in the case of her parents, who face felony child abuse charges, Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said. 'This child has the best chance at a normal adult life by receiving the therapy and education she needs and residing in the setting of her current foster home,' he said. A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) have not been charged with murder after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home in January. The eldest will receive probation and counseling. The girl and her 11-year-old sister were initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the January 5 shooting in Lake City. No charges were filed against the younger sister. The names of the members of the family are not being released because of the girls' ages and because of abuse allegations. On January 5, the girls and their three-year-old sister were left by their parents in the care of their brother. The parents were away on a work-related truck drive. Police say the brother locked the elder sister in her room, but when he fell asleep, she persuaded the 11-year-old to let her out so she could shower. The boy, 16, was killed by his sister, 15, on January 5 after she escaped the room her brother had locked her in and shot him in the neck. The older sister asked her younger sister to keep watch as she went outside and cut out the air conditioner of her parents' locked bedroom window to retrieve a pistol. The girl asked her younger sister to take their three-year-old sister and hide in a closet before she shot her brother in the neck as he slept, police said. The two older girls fled the house, leaving the toddler behind. They were later found by police outside a Dollar General store after the younger girl called a friend saying she needed a ride. Documents show that the elder girl suffered years of abuse, including being locked in her bedroom for days regularly with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom. The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police. In the room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the teenage girl was stealing and talking back. Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation. 'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their January report. In addition, documents showed that she had been sexually abused by her uncle, who was convicted in 2010. The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time. According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. The uncle had told her to'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'. The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year. The parents have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved. The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list. Authorities also said the children's mother had discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. The mother told police that she separated the siblings and asked them what happened. The girl told her mother that she did not want to 'do it' with her brother but he put pressure on her. She also referenced the earlier abuse by her uncle. After an investigation by child welfare officials, no one was charged. Her parents had also removed her from school, documents show. Siegmeister said all of the family's history and circumstances were taken into consideration in the decision not to pursue more serious criminal charges. 'This case is a tragedy to all those involved: the deceased, the two arrested children, as well as their 3-year-old sister who has been separated from them both.

{"article": "Things got very steamy this morning at the Today show studios when host Hoda Kotb and TV personality Regis Philbin took part in new charity dare The Twizzler Challenge live on air, and shared a passionate - if very one-sided - kiss. Hoda, 50, looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when Regis, 83, energetically took the lead on the act; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle. When Hoda's quick peck on Regis' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former NBC co-host, he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch, as Hoda froze up in surprise. Scroll down for video. Good cause: Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the Twizzler test has taken off, and benefits Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism. Magic moment: The stunt required Hoda and Regis to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle. Hoda and Regis were officially dared to take on the Twizzler Challenge last week by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves shared a series of rather awkward, perfunctory kisses during their on-screen moment. Once the concept, which aims to raise awareness for autism, was explained to Regis during his guest segment on the show this morning, he enthusiastically asked: 'Are we going to kiss?' 'I'm not sure,' responded Hoda, before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray. 'Let me look at your lips,' Regis exclaimed, leaning in. 'She could swallow me! I've never seen lips like that. Honest to God, something's going to happen.' And indeed it did. Hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached Regis' lips, before issuing him a conservative peck. Too much? Today host Hoda Kotb, 50, (right) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning's Twizzler Challenge, when former co-host Regis Philbin, 83, (left) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker. Not finished: Hoda gave Regis a quick peck, before jerking her head away from him. Regis then launched in for a full-on smooch, as Hoda darted her head away, only for Regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth-to-mouth smacker. 'Boy you look like you went in there!' squealed Kathie Lee, as Hoda recovered in stunned silence. 'It was pretty good,' attested Regis, lipstick smeared over his face. 'You got a boyfriend?' Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism. Last week at the NBC studios,  Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee were nominated by fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira. Meredith explained that she first took the challenge with Today co-anchor Willie Geist the previous week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide. Get away! Hoda tried to push Regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further. Recovery: Hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display, which took place live on air. 'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said. Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.' Panic: Ironically, it was Regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began, telling Hoda that he was worried she would'swallow him' because of the size of her lips. Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.' 'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause. 'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained. Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner.

{"article": "As Demelza suggestively asked Ross Poldark to help unfasten her dress, it was the steamy love scene fans had been waiting for. But while most of the drama\u2019s huge audience of viewers were transfixed by the unfolding romance, some were left scratching their heads with the question \u2013 how did she put on the gown in the first place without assistance? The strong-willed servant, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, 22, told Aidan Turner\u2019s Poldark that she needed his help to remove the dress as it undid from the back. However, it was never explained how, this being the case, she had squeezed into the outfit unaided in the first place. Scroll down for video. How did she get it on? Demelza asked Poldark to help her to remove her dress, but fans were left confused as to how she got the gown on in the first place. By why would she want to? A Poldark spokesman said: 'Of course Demelza could have got the dress off by herself' This led to a number of fans of the BBC1 drama to take to Twitter during Sunday\u2019s episode to pose this very question, with many joking it had been a clever ploy to lure Poldark between the sheets. With no sense of time passing, other viewers expressed puzzlement at how quickly the story was progressing, with Demelza marrying Poldark just minutes after they first kissed on screen. Also, Elizabeth, the other object of Poldark\u2019s brooding affections, gave birth just one episode after dramatically announcing she was pregnant. Despite these minor concerns the vast majority of the audience still seem enthralled by the Cornwall-set adventure, based on the novels by Winston Graham.

After Demelza and Poldark spent the night together, one tweeted: \u2018Enjoying Poldark great chemistry between Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson - but how did Demelza get the dress done up?!\u2019 While another added: \u2018Okay Demelza I get it you need help getting your dress off *wink wink* but how exactly did you do it up in the first place?\u2019 A third joked: \u2018RE : Poldark & Demelza. As a costume fairy, I have to ask, if she needed help getting out of the dress... WHO GOT HER INTO THE DRESS [sic].\u2019 Other viewers seemed fazed by the pace of the script. Fans pointed out that barely ten minutes elapsed between the scenes where Poldark first kissed Demelza and the pair tying the knot on screen. Others were left bemused that Elizabeth, played by Heida Reed, revealed she was pregnant at the end of the second episode and then gave birth during the third.

Last night's bombing increased the campaign's death toll to 62 - while the conflict slowly widens in scale as Iranian-allied Houthi fighters attempt to overthrow Yemen's Western and Saudi-backed Hadi.

Airport staff said dozens of other foreigners working for international oil companies and NGOs also flew out to Ethiopia and Djibouti. On Friday, the Houthis and allied army units gained their first foothold on Yemen's Arabian Sea coast by seizing Shaqra, 60miles (100km) east of Aden, allowing them to open a new front to march on the south's main city. Riyadh's intervention, a surprise move from a conservative monarchy better known for flexing its muscle in oil markets than through military might, is planned to last a month but could extend for five or six, a Gulf diplomatic source said. He said satellite imagery had shown that the Houthis had repositioned long-range Scud missiles in the north, close to the Saudi border and aimed at Saudi territory.

AP McCoy rides Jezki to a disappointing fourth in the Champion Hurdle on day one of Cheltenham. In truth, McCoy has known plenty of days like this at Cheltenham before, and while he will have felt disappointment, his supporters in a record opening-day crowd of 63,000 had much to compensate them. The thought of this Festival helps sustain some people through the long winter months and, when it finally arrived, it could hardly have been more glorious. Cleeve Hill almost shimmered in the background as springtime attempted its own burst to the front.

The cognoscenti know that there is little low hanging fruit for him at Cheltenham this year, but there are still three days left to make this a fitting valedictory appearance. The fantasy ending remains victory on Friday, either in the Gold Cup or the meeting\u2019s final race, which has been temporarily renamed in his honour. He might be a far more sanguine character than when he first started racking up the champion jockey titles, but frustration was etched into his features as he went in and out of the weighing room. McCoy had considered Jezki (above) as his best chance of a winner at Cheltenham this year. You do not become the nation\u2019s most durable sportsman without defeats continuing to sting. On Tuesday these came in the form of finishing ninth, last, fifth, fourth and pulling up in his five races. It is a strange day when American Rich Ricci, uber-wealthy banker and the pantomime villain of racehorse ownership, gets more cheers in the parade ring than someone deemed a national treasure, but this was one of them. McCoy has admitted that he is anxious about the prospect of retirement, but afternoons such as on Tuesday might serve to ease the fear. No defeat hurt more than coming fourth on Jezki in the Champion Hurdle, and the horse\u2019s trainer Jessica Harrington revealed he had been quick to take responsibility. McCoy looks dejected after the final race, the Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices\u2019 Handicap Steeplechase. \u2018AP was blaming himself, saying he took on Faugheen at the top of the hill, and in chasing the winner it probably cost him second or third and he finished fourth,\u2019 she said. \u2018If he had ridden him to be second to Faugheen then he may well have been second.\u2019 The latter scenario was never likely to happen, especially as McCoy had identified Jezki, the defending champion from last year, as probably his best chance in 2015. He was not to add to his comparatively modest Festival tally of 30 winners, a total exceeded not just by Walsh but Barry Geraghty, too. He has tasted glory here \u2014 the Gold Cup win on Synchronised and the masterclass on Wichita Lineman in the 2009 William Hill \u2014 but it is 17 years since he was the leading jockey at this Bacchanalian jamboree. McCoy, riding Bold Henry, pulled up with two fences left in the final race of the day. McCoy, riding in his last Cheltenham Festival, did not have the day he would have hoped upon arrival. Some revellers had gone home as he set off in the last race, the exotically-named Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices\u2019 Handicap Steeplechase, on Bold Henry. They were never in it and pulled up with two fences left. Afterwards McCoy had what looked like a lengthy inquest with the owner JP McManus before fairly sprinting back to the weighing room for the last time. He was not in the mood to discuss the afternoon\u2019s events, saying only \u2018it was all right.\u2019 Perhaps he could merely have pointed to the name of the horse who had started favourite and just come second in the final chase.

{"article": "When Lara Kelly started posting pictures on social media to track her weight loss journey, the 21-year-old never thought she would end up as the face of weight loss scams. The corporate receptionist, from Bunbury in Western Australia, had lost 57 kilograms over three years through exercise and carefully planned eating plans. To keep her motivated, Ms Kelly posted photos on her Tumblr\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram\u00a0pages to help others. Scroll down for video. Lara Kelly's pictures started appearing in weight loss advertisements, promoting diet supplements. The ads claims to help people to lose weight by erasing '13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks' 'It's a hard thing, it's a huge task [to lose weight],' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I know for me to see other people who have done this and to achieve these results, it\u2019s very motivating for me. I wanted to share my own experiences. 'For other people, it's good to have someone who's been though it before and ask questions.' So far, her Tumblr blog has attracted about 20,000 followers. Another ad found by Lara Kelly, from Bunbury in Western Australia, which used her photo without permission. The 21-year-old has spent three years, exercising and devising eating plans, to lose a total of 57 kilograms. But her well-documented progress was twisted by online advertisements, who started using photographs of her dramatic transformation without her permission, to promote dieting pills which promised to 'erase 13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks'. It was claimed Ms Kelly had used dieting pills to achieve her new look. She had not been aware of the unauthorised use of her image until friends started tagging her and strangers made contact with her about the drugs she had allegedly used for her weight loss. 'People... asked me what my opinion was of them [the pills]. I had to tell them I'd never used them in my life,' Ms Kelly told Daily Mail Australia. 'When it first started getting messages I was shocked. I was trying to get my friends to report [the ads].\u00a0But when you get one taken down, 10 more pop up to take its place.' Ms Kelly started out as 120 kilograms and was a size 18 to 20. She is now a size 8 and weighs 63 kilograms. The photographs used were taken from her Tumblr and Instagram sites, which she used to document her progress to motivate others and herself. Ms Kelly said she had tried to track the people who were taking her photo down but she was unsuccessful. 'It's mainly Facebook pages that post the links to other external sites,' she said. 'I message the pages and report them and they just disappear and then pop up again later, or they just block me.' To help combat her picture being used for scams, Ms Kelly started watermarking her snaps with her Instagram handle. But this did not stop them as it could be cropped out or blurred. Ms Kelly urged people not the believe everything they read on the internet. 'Don't look at the picture and assume someone has taken drugs to lose 20 kilos in two weeks,' she said. 'Everyone wants a quick fix. Weight loss is hard, but it's worth it in the end.' Weight loss scams are described by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Scam Watch\u00a0as those that 'promise weight loss for little or no effort'. 'The scam may involve an unusual or restrictive diet, \"revolutionary\" exercise or fat-busting devices, or products such as pills, patches, or creams,' the website said. 'Often, attractive people or celebrities are used to sell the products. These may be people with a different body shape and metabolism to you and who use the product in conjunction with an exercise regime and strict diet. 'At best fad diets and products might result in a temporary weight loss in the short term and can be dangerous if followed over a longer period.'", "abstract": "Lara Kelly, a 21-year-old from Western Australia, who lost 57 kilograms over three years through exercise and carefully planned eating plans, has become the face of weight loss scams.

Kate has given her signature lipstick a charitable makeover and it comes complete with a dotty red and black lid. At that point, funnyman David Walliams appears on the set dressed in various guises, which show a remarkable likeness to the trio of catwalk stars. In his incarnation of Cara he wears a leather jacket with a beanie hat and a collection of gold chains. Acting up for the camera, he can be seen smudging his lipstick, eating make-up and pulling wacky poses. As he larks around in high-energy mode, he also depicts her destroying the set with her antics. As Marks and Spencer beauty Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Walliams opts for a more feminine approach, which sees him gliding around in a bra and knickers. However, perhaps the funniest impression of them all is that of Cindy Crawford. While strutting around in a skin-tight dress and huge wig, he shows off a hilarious - and hairy - over-sized mole on his face.

The couple also raise daughter Lila Grace, 12, who Kate has with her ex-partner Jefferson Hack. 'My wife is very much my sidekick,' Jamie previously told The Mirror. 'So I tend to get separation anxiety when I\u2019m away from her.' The pair have been lying low since enjoying a wild weekend break with their famous friends including Noel Gallagher, Nick Grimshaw and Sadie Frost. They jetted off to Scotland to celebrate nutritionist and former model Rose Ferguson\u2019s 40th birthday with a Burns-themed bash at the Craigellachie Hotel on the banks of the River Spey.

David Cameron has emerged as the most popular party leader families would like to seeing moving in next door to them. With fewer than 60 days until the general election on May 7, attention is focussing on the party leaders as they set out their pitch to voters. While policies will always be important, the\u00a0personality\u00a0of the leader could be key to securing the support of swing voters.

Mr Farage, who once sparked controversy for saying people would be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door, was the top choice of the 18-24-year-olds, backed by 25 per cent. But the Ukip leader slumped to fourth place among the 25-34 and 35-44 age group, but was third for 45-54 and 55+ voters.

{"article": "A Labour MP is to repay expenses after claiming the cost of a poppy wreath to honour the war dead on Remembrance Day. Sarah Champion admitted the claim'should never have been made' and will return the \u00a317 to the expenses watchdog this week. The MP, who was the star of a documentary about life in the Commons, billed the taxpayer for the tribute last November. Labour MP Sarah Champion billed the taxpayer \u00a317 for a poppy wreath for Remembrance Day. According to official releases from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, Miss Champion submitted the claim for 'Wreath for Remembrance Sunday', describing it as 'necessary expenses to 11/11/14'.

{"article": "It was Billy Connolly who once joked that Ally Macleod thought tactics were a new kind of peppermint. And amusing though that might have been, it expressed a British suspicion that tactics somehow meant over-thinking the game. Some will say the game is all about having good players and that the manager only has so much control. Of course, you can\u2019t legislate for everything that\u2019s going to happen on the pitch. But, when Brendan Rodgers turns around a season by simply deploying players in different areas of the pitch, even the most hardened sceptic ought to be able to see just how important tactics are and that tweaking your system can be a game-changer. Brendan Rodgers addresses his players as they prepare for the Manchester United clash at Anfield. The Liverpool manager was under pressure earlier in the season after a poor start to the campaign. The Liverpool manager was on the back foot in December. His team were conceding goals, they could not score and they didn\u2019t look anything like the side they had been the previous season. People were even suggesting he might be sacked. What a bold and clever move to go to three at back and push the wing-backs on. Ironically, he first did it at Old Trafford in December \u2014 and his reward was a 3-0 defeat. But they have not lost in the Premier League and FA Cup since then and even on that day you could see they were on to something. They had six one-on-one opportunities and should not have lost the game. It is a shrewd system. I played it with England when we won Le Tournoi in France in 1997, when I had Paul Merson and Paul Scholes behind Ian Wright and two holding midfield players behind them. Those two in the pocket \u2014 the Merson/Scholes pairing in my team or two of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling for Liverpool \u2014 have the freedom to get wide, to move in front of wing-backs or to go inside into positions that threaten in the box. Lallana and Coutinho have done it particularly well. That system has turned their results around. Liverpool manager Rodgers talks to midfielder Adam Lallana at training ahead of the visit of United. Rodgers issues instructions to his players before a training session at Melwood on Friday. Glenn Hoddle played three at the back when he was England manager. The shock factor: why Liverpool\u2019s 3-4-3 works... The key is that no one else plays it. I watched the 2-2 draw against Arsenal in December and although Liverpool equalised in the last minute, it was clear that Arsenal didn\u2019t have a clue how to play the system. Liverpool had 63 per cent of the possession. And I doubt that\u2019s ever happened to a team of Arsene Wenger\u2019s playing with 11 men. Liverpool can push the front three up to press the opposition high up the pitch. The wing-backs don\u2019t have to get back and cover as much as a full-back does, so they can be right in behind and the side has five, six or even seven pressing up top. It has restored the energy to Liverpool\u2019s game, enabled them to pin teams back and to dominate possession. Suddenly, they looked like the 2013-14 side. If you need to defend, you can drop deep and have a back five, so the system has flexibility. But Liverpool usually deploy it in a positive fashion and the way in which it uses space to ensure that everyone has an option means it is incredibly hard to play against. Martin Skrtel heads the equaliser in injury time during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal back in December. Arsene Wenger tries to organise his Arsenal side as they relinquished 63 per cent possession to Liverpool.... but Louis van Gaal\u2019s back three doesn\u2019t work. Louis van Gaal has used a back three several times in his career \u2014 in his Ajax team that won the Champions League, at Barcelona and very successfully in the World Cup with Holland. But at Manchester United he hasn\u2019t been able to deploy it with the success that Rodgers has at Liverpool. The key for me is that your back three need to be able to accept the ball and move it even under pressure. Liverpool are prepared to give their defenders the ball under pressure and they\u2019ve been comfortable with that. That\u2019s why Emre Can, initially signed as a midfielder, has been so important. His technique on the ball gives them a safety valve in possession at the back. United, with the likes of Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans, have not succeeded because they are not comfortable in possession under pressure. Therefore the system hasn\u2019t proved to be an attacking springboard and can slow down their game. Rodgers has deployed Emre Can, originally signed as a midfielder, as one of the back three. Louis van Gaal has also used three at the back with United but has not enjoyed success like Rodgers.", "abstract": "Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has turned around his team's season by deploying a 3-4-3 formation, which has given his players more freedom to move around the pitch and press the opposition. The system has proved successful because no other team in the Premier League plays it, and it has restored the energy to Liverpool's game, enabling them to dominate possession and pin teams back. In contrast, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has not been able to deploy the system with the same success, as his defenders are not comfortable in possession under pressure."}

The mob stamped on her, battered her with pieces of wood and bricks, and then burned her body in the Kabul River. Reports suggest that Farkhunda had suffered from mental illness for many years and had not meant to burn the holy book."}

Twenty-three people, most of them tourists, were killed after gunmen opened fire inside the Bardo Museum, a stone's throw from the parliament building. The \"I will come to Tunisia\" social media campaign is aimed at protecting the North African nation's tourism industry -- which is critical to the country's economy. The social media campaign features users holding up signs saying they will travel to the North African country. \"I will travel to Tunisia this summer,\" reads a sign held up by a girl from China. A Dutch man's paper says: \"Heroes! I will visit Tunisia and celebrate your Independence Day.\" Tens of thousands of people online have expressed support and solidarity with #JeSuisBardo (\"I am Bardo\"), #JeSuisTunisien (\"I am Tunisian\"), and #PrayForTunisia trending on Twitter. Some one in five Tunisians rely on tourism for their living, the nation's tourism minister said in 2013. Travel warnings in place in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries could cripple Tunisia's economy. It's a fresh wound after a painful few years in the birthplace of the Arab Spring. Visits to the country dropped significantly after the unrest of the 2010-2011 Jasmine Revolution, but the numbers had been bouncing back before the museum attack. An online advertisement to visit Tunisia, posted long before the attacks, shows people holding hands at some of Tunisia's most treasured landmarks. Human chains form across beaches, mountains, ancient ruins, the desert. The message: \"All united to welcome you.\" This week, those words were repeated in social media. A Tunisian woman, also part of the campaign, holds a sign: \"Welcome To Tunisia. We are not terrorists,\" followed by the hashtag #notafraid. In this online campaign, fear itself is the enemy. A Tunisian lawmaker spoke to that this week, sharing with the world:. \"We are not afraid.\"", "abstract": "The \"I will come to Tunisia\" social media campaign has been launched to protect the North African nation's tourism industry, which is critical to the country's economy, after the deadly attack in the Tunis on Wednesday.

{"article": "A friend of Jewish schoolgirl Anne Frank has told of the moment the two were reunited at a Nazi concentration camp - where she found her 15-year-old friend emaciated and wrapped only in blankets as she struggled to survive the camp's harsh conditions. Nanette Konig, 85, had known Anne from school and had attended the teenager's birthday party where she received the infamous diary in which she went on to detail her life hiding from the Nazis. After being captured, the classmates spent around two years apart before being reunited in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Recalling their chance encounter within the camp, Mrs Konig said: 'She was depleted, wrapped in blankets because her clothes were full of lice. Scroll down for video. Nanette Konig holds a photo of herself aged 12, when she was captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\u00a0She has now recalled the moment her friend Anne Frank was given a diary which she later used to detail life hiding from the Nazis. Mrs Konig holds the yellow star she was forced to wear while living in Amsterdam under Nazi occupation. 'It was really awful because she had completely wasted away. There was nothing left of her. Even today I don't know how we two skeletons could have recognised each other.' Now Mrs Konig pays tribute to Anne, who died aged 15, just weeks before the camp was liberated 70 years ago. The pair were just two of the millions of Jews rounded up into concentration camps following persecution from the Nazis.\u00a0More than six million Jews were killed worldwide in the genocide. Anne's parents Margot and Otto Frank were deported to a transit camp with Anne and her sister Margot and then on to Auschwitz. When Anne and her sister were taken to Bergen-Belsen in October that year, Mrs Konig spotted her friend through a barbed wire fence. Mrs Konig said: 'I saw Anne walking on the other side of some barbed wire. 'I couldn't go near it though, I would have been tortured or killed.' But when the wire was taken down and Mrs Konig next spotted her friend, she grabbed Anne's attention and the girls met up to talk several times. 'I am the only one in that class who met her again in Bergen-Belsen. I was in camp seven and she was in camp eight. 'I met her several times and it was from Anne that I learnt what was happening in Auschwitz. 'She told me about her diary and that she wanted to use it for a book after the war, she never wanted to publish a diary. 'We talked about her going in to hiding, how hard life was in the hiding place.' Mrs Konig recalled how the girls were aware of the terrifying circumstances they were in. Anne Frank died aged 15 at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Her diary detailing the time her family spent hiding from the Nazis has sold more than 30million copies. She said: 'We were dreaming and we had to hope we would make it through. It was part of our survival. 'We were mature - the circumstances made us like that. We had all lost family and didn't know if we'd see them again. Everyone wanted to survive, nobody wanted to die willingly.' Anne's diary was\u00a0first published in 1947 and has been translated into 67 languages with more than 30 million copies sold. Recalling the moment Anne received her gift as a birthday present, Mrs Konig said: 'Anne wanted to use the pages of her diary to write a book. 'We were dreaming of the future, it was part of our survival. 'She always wanted to be seen and heard. Anne was a girl who was full of life, she loved to talk and liked the boys. 'If she was still alive, I am convinced that she would have become an excellent writer. In the end, she got her wish to be a published author.' Mrs Konig, who was one of 60,000 survivors liberated from Bergen-Belsen by British forces. 'I saw Anne shortly before she died,' Mrs Jonig said. 'Bergen-Belsen wasn't a death camp but the conditions eliminated people. It's very emotional. She didn't make it and I did. I still see her in front of me.' Mrs Konig, who now lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil, with her husband, John, went to school with Anne Frank in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation. In 1941, they were classmates at the Jewish Lyceum, a school for Jewish children no longer allowed to attend normal schools. The Frank family had already fled Germany following persecution and moved to the Netherlands along with 300,000 other German Jews. The pupils in these schools were taught by Jewish teachers who had been removed from their posts at normal schools. Mrs Konig said: 'I sat behind Anne in class and we were friends. I remember she always wanted to be seen and heard. 'We were all friends in class.

In an extraordinary move, which was condemned by ministers, the Unite general-secretary said he was seeking to change the giant union\u2019s constitution to authorise illegal action. Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Ed Miliband more than \u00a314 million, said union members could not be expected to obey \u2018oppressive\u2019 laws that restrict the right to strike. Unite general-secretary Len McCluskey\u00a0said he was seeking to change the giant union\u2019s constitution to authorise illegal action. The Conservatives have said they will change the law to require unions to get the support of at least 40 per cent of their members before calling a strike. The initiative is designed to prevent union bosses ordering strikes on the basis of ballots in which only a tiny number of members have voted. Mr McCluskey said the right to strike was already \u2018hanging by a thread\u2019 as a result of union reforms carried out by the Coalition. In a move that suggests he has little confidence in a Labour victory, Mr McCluskey said Unite members would now be asked to vote to remove the words \u2018so far as may be lawful\u2019 from the rules governing the union's actions. In a speech to lawyers, Mr Cluskey said: \u2018These words will go not because we are anarchists, not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery - but because we have to ask ourselves the question, can we any longer make that commitment to, under any and all circumstances, stick within the law as it stands? Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Ed Miliband more than \u00a314 million. \u2018It is no exaggeration to say that the right to strike in this - the first country of free trade unionism - was and is hanging by a thread. \u2018But should there be a Conservative majority in May, there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy. \u2018The bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any MPs would get over in their own constituencies, by a government which has refused our requests to use modern, more effective balloting methods. \u2018When the law is misguided, when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question. I'm giving you the answer. It ain't going to happen.\u2019 Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude condemned the move \u2013 and said it would raise further concerns Unite\u2019s planned \u2018merger\u2019 with the PCS union. Mr Maude said: \u2018Labour's biggest donor and Ed Miliband's puppet master is now advocating that their membership break the law. Ed Miliband needs to immediately condemn this outrageous proposal and refuse to take a penny more from Unite until these plans are cancelled.\u2019 Tory MP Dominc Raab said it was \u2018shocking\u2019 for a union leader to call for illegal action \u2013 and called on Mr Miliband to disown the move. Mr Raab, who has campaigned for the introduction of minimum strike thresholds, said: \u2018Red Len has never managed to persuade even a quarter of Unite members to back even one of his reckless public sector strikes since 2010, but it's still shocking to hear him preparing to break the law. Ed Miliband has taken millions from this union bully since becoming Labour leader, so if he now fails to condemn this threat of illegal strikes, it will just show the public what a weak leader he is.\u2019 Unite activists will decide on the change of wording to the union's rules at a conference later in the year.

The live-in girlfriend of an accused child molester from Indiana allegedly had helped the suspect arrange sexual encounters with young girls, according to recently unsealed court documents. Mark Speer, 44, a plumber from Lafayette, was arrested in August on suspicion of molesting a 3-year-old girl and creating child pornography videos. In the course of the investigation into the claims, police received permission to access Speer's private messages on Facebook and the dating site Zoosk exchanged between him and his girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster. Search warrants released last month state that Kaster had assisted her boyfriend in scheduling his illicit encounters with children. One Facebook message sent from Kaster's account to Speer December 22, 2013, read: 'i think i have the best chance getting her or the younger [girl]...so far that\u2019s all i got.' Speer reportedly replied that Kaster's update turned him on. Kaster, who has not been charged with any crime, told detectives that she and Speer had an open relationship, in which he was allowed to have sex with other women he met online, according to the court documents cited by Indianapolis Star. Speer was charged last September with child molesting, attempted child molesting and criminal confinement, along with federal child pornography charges,. The charges against the 44-year-old stemmed from the discovery of a half-dozen videos on his cell phone featuring a 3-year-old girl in his house wearing nothing but a pair of socks. Go-between:\u00a0Speer's live-in-girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster, is suspected of helping the Indiana plumber (left and right) arrange encounters with young victims via Facebook and Twitter. When questioned by Indiana State Police in August about the videos, Speer claimed he recorded them because the toddler was 'acting goofy' and 'dancing around.' Court papers released last fall revealed that in one of the clips, Speer is heard saying about the child: 'This pretty little thing's mind,'and, 'Oh my God, I\u2019ve already got her naked.' The suspect told police the girl's mother took off her clothes after the 3-year-old had spilled ice cream of herself.

{"article": "Events in Dublin on Sunday served as a jolting indication that England remain a work in progress and are running out of opportunities to establish momentum going into the World Cup. The RBS 6 Nations title is now Ireland\u2019s to lose and it is Joe Schmidt\u2019s team \u2014 on the back of 10 successive victories \u2014 who are emerging as Europe\u2019s primary challengers at the global showpiece on these shores later this year. On Monday, 200 days before the tournament begins at Twickenham when the hosts confront Fiji, England dropped a place to fourth in the World Rugby rankings, behind their Irish conquerors. Stuart Lancaster and his assistant coaches are running out of time to prepare for the World Cup. Stuart Lancaster and his assistant coaches have some key issues to address this week as they seek to orchestrate a prompt revival. First up, major Tests are running out. Arguably, the really momentous occasions England need to sharpen preparations for the World Cup have already passed. Facing Ireland on Sunday was the last such encounter. The national team now have home games against Scotland and France, who are in a state of near-disarray, which will not challenge them to the extent they were challenged in Cardiff and, especially, in Dublin. England's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against Ireland. Chris Robshaw couldn\u2019t set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over Australia. There are home-and-away clashes with the French in August but by the time England take on Ireland the following month, both countries will be keeping their powder dry. There are also no short-cuts. Lancaster is attempting to fast-forward the evolution of a squad largely made up of young players. But what the defeat on Sunday proved is the importance of nous and experience, which the Irish had in abundance. England have a glaring caps deficit against most of the leading nations and it is too late to rectify that. The coaches must hope their rookies learn fast. Lancaster struggled for nous and experience in the defeat to Ireland as he fastracks a young Lions squad. Slow starts are another problem, with England falling behind in all three of their Six Nations matches this season. They were under siege early on in Dublin and Cardiff. Fundamental errors keep occurring in the opening minutes which leave them playing catch-up. Against Wales, they managed to do just that \u2014 impressively so \u2014 but Ireland never let them back into it. Lancaster and his team will review the tone of their match build-ups to see if they can find a way of ensuring the players start at the right pitch of emotional intensity. Decision-making under pressure has become a major issue. The men charged with steering the English ship struggled in Dublin. Minds were scrambled and execution levels dipped. Robshaw takes on Tommy O'Donnell during the RBS Six Nations match between Ireland and England.

Chris Robshaw couldn\u2019t set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over Australia, Wales and Italy, while half-backs Ben Youngs and George Ford were eclipsed by Conor Murray and Jonny Sexton. England need calm heads. Lancaster is reluctant to deploy Danny Cipriani from the bench but he will be far more willing to turn to Owen Farrell when the injured Lion is available again. Ireland\u2019s air and ground assault exposed English shortcomings, not just their aerial blitz, but also with their work at the breakdown. The visitors\u2019 kicking often lacked accuracy and threat, and they were beaten to the ball in the air far too often for comfort. That is a concern, given the prowess of World Cup pool rivals Australia and Wales in that area. Those nations also have the personnel to cause trouble at the ruck and England cannot afford to regularly concede the initiative in the battle over the ball. They have predatory runners like Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson out wide, but without quick ball, they are hampered. As for selection conundrums, there were no hindsight-driven grumbles about the make-up of the team in Dublin, it\u2019s just that the chosen men couldn\u2019t deliver. Richard Wigglesworth of Saracens is seen as the leading scrum-half in the country in terms of his tactical kicking game, so he may come into consideration for a starting place.

{"article": "Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines. In a battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS over control of Tikrit recently, the tomb of Saddam Hussein was squashed to rubble, though it's not clear which side did it. Luckily, the ancient city of Babylon is outside the extremists' grasp, south of Baghdad. For nearly 5,000 years it has stood as a symbol of the glory of ancient Mesopotamian civilization. Saddam Hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s, leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there. They bear his name and describe him as the son of Nebuchadnezzar, who had the reputation of being ancient Babylon's greatest king. One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city. But it continues to be source of great pride for Iraqis who see themselves as the heirs of the world's oldest civilization. And many Iraqis know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot. \"This wasn't Saddam's,\" said Adnan Abu Fatima. \"It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians.\" Abu Fatima strolled through the ruins with his family. Saddam's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him, but ISIS' destruction appalls him. \"The Mosul museum was destroyed. Why?\" he wants to know from ISIS. \"That is the heritage of your grandfathers. Why did you do that?\" The defacers' reasoning? The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the \"age of ignorance,\" ISIS says, before the advent of Islam. Antiquity is an integral part of Iraq's national identity. History is measured there not in centuries but in millennia, and Iraqi's take such vandalism to heart. They've had to watch since the U.S. invasion in 2003 how artifacts have been stolen. Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world. The U.S. State Department has announced it will return more than 60 items on Monday, which had been sneaked into the United States. Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them. Hassan fled Mosul when ISIS overran it last year then later ransacked the museum. \"When I saw what happened, I was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from ISIS,\" he said. Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department. \"Babylon is our soul.\" It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers. The military has started a drive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from the extremists. After the rage of a battle subsided, they moved in to the outskirt town of Awja to find the former dictator's tomb flattened. Video of soldiers standing on top of it was posted to YouTube. They celebrated the posthumous slap against their former tormentor. One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site. It was a piece of history they were glad to part with. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported and wrote from Babylon, and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.", "abstract": "ISIS has destroyed ancient statues, ruins, and religious sites in Iraq, but the ancient city of Babylon remains untouched and a source of pride for Iraqis. Saddam Hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s, leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there, but Iraqis see themselves as the heirs of the world's oldest civilization and know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot. Antiquity is an integral part of Iraq's national identity, and Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS."}

The Environment Agency issued 24 flood alerts across the UK with rescue teams called to a number of incidents on the coast. In Chiswick, West London, motorists ploughed through flooded streets after the tide climbed three metres in height as a result of the rare eclipse. Parts of Chiswick in West London flooded over the weekend after the Solar Eclipse which caused higher tides. The Thames Barrier closed over the weekend to protect London from further flooding. Above, a cyclist in Chiswick drudges through the water. The Thames Barrier closed on Saturday\u00a0to protect London from the high tides linked to the solar eclipse and'supermoon' which caused rising water levels. Flood alerts were issued across much of the country with the Met Office predicting that some areas would still be affected today. The rising tides came after Friday's Solar Eclipse, the first of its kind for 16 years. With the sun and moon aligning, higher tides were to be expected. But added to the fact the Earth was at its closest point to both, they were slightly larger than usual. Enthusiasts hailed the phenomenon as the'supertide of the century', with hundreds flocking to coastal points across the country. Some encountered trouble at sea as a result of the weather, with one family plucked from Watergate Bay in Newquay by a lifeboat after becoming trapped in a cove. A grandmother and her two granddaughters had to be rescued when the waters became too high. RNLI volunteer Lifeboat Operations Manager Gareth Horner said: 'The group were a bit damp but unharmed after becoming trapped around three hours before high-water as often happens along this stretch of coast.' The combination of the eclipse and the Earth being at its closes point to the moon and sun caused water levels to rise. A child narrowly avoids a soaking in Chiswick, West London yesterday. The Environment Agency issued more than 20 flood alerts over the weekend withs ome parts expected to have trouble until Monday. An hour later the same team rescued a couple by the tide on Towan Island, while four teenagers were plucked from chest-high water elsewhere. One Dorset coastguard officer said in his 24 years working for the service he had never seen the tide come back in so quickly. The four foreign teenagers, who didn't speak much English, called the emergency services panicking because they were lost and becoming cut off by a rising tide near Old Harry Rocks. Anne-Marie Clerk from Poole lifeboat said: 'The group didn't know the area and had carried on walking along the shore near Old Harry because the tide was extremely low. 'They raised the alarm sometime after 5pm when they realised they couldn't get back. 'They were under the cliff and there was loose rock behind them so they couldn't climb out and the water was up to their chests. 'They were all fine but they were really oblivious to what danger they had been in. 'The tides come back so quickly and it was fortunate they had phones with them, although only one was working when they called for help because the others had been damaged by the water.' Poole volunteer lifeboat coxswain Jonathan Clark added: 'We are experiencing very extreme spring tides and low waters at the moment due to the Spring Equinox and areas of the foreshore are being exposed.' He added the youngsters were 'exceptionally lucky' not to have found themselves in more danger. Roaring waves at the promenade in Roker, Sunderland, on Saturday some 24 hours after the eclipse.

{"article": "It might seem strange, but more and more unusual ingredients have been making their way into culinary favourites. Horlicks makes it into more recipes than you might imagine, with Nigella Lawson including it in her Malteaser cake, and Jamie Oliver swearing by it for a killer hot chocolate. And while the inclusion of the malted milk powder in sweet dishes might be a tad obvious, it's also a key item in one chef's savoury crab cakes. The soft flavour of Horlicks works really well against the big Thai flavours of the crab and fish cakes. The Horlicks recommendation comes from Chef Paul Hartley, who's devised a whole world of drink based recipes in his Horlicks cookbook. Chef Harley explains that the soft flavour of the drink powder works really well against the big Thai flavours of the crab and fish cakes. And as well as being a Horlicks baking fan, Nigella is a dedicated user of Marmite in recipes. Coconut water for its high-quality hydrating benefits. Sun Chlorella 'A' algae tablets which contains amino acids and chlorophyll for energy. Acai powder, which contains high antioxidant levels. Camu Camu powder for a hit of vitamin C content for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. Maca powder - a powerful adaptogen which helps the body handle physical stress. Raw honey for a fast-release sugar hit for energy burst as well as helping to support the immune system. Far from a rogue dollop of the yeast extract in a casserole, Marmite is the star of the show in her spaghetti dish as she says the product offers saltiness and savouriness the way a stock cube might. Marmite also makes a star appearance in mushrooms, and chocolate cupcakes (recipes below) proving that the love it or hate it condiment has a lot more to it than meets the eye. While porridge is a boring breakfast staple for most of us, this particular version (recipe below), created by 400m hurdler Ruben Tabares, is full of exotic foods from around the world including superfood Sun Chlorella, a nutritious single celled green algae. Want an excuse to eat more chocolate but think dinnertime could be a step too far? Not according to the Hairy Bikers. The bearded chefs say 'adding chocolate to Chilli con Carne, gives it a luxurious velvety sheen.' Be sure to opt for good quality dark chocolate to strengthen the flavours in this punchy dish. Britain's favourite savoury yeast spread has made the leap from the breakfast table and is now considered a serious kitchen ingredient.

{"article": "As PR blunders go it was hardly on the scale of Gerald Ratner's infamous quip that one of his jewellery company's products was 'c***'. But Manchester City's decision to extend Frank Lampard's contract to the end of the season, rather than allowing him to move as planned to sister club New York City, left many questioning whether the powers-that-be in Abu Dhabi believed their new American operation was an inferior product. Some in the Big Apple, who had already shelled out for season tickets, demanded refunds. In the home of Broadway, others rather dramatically branded it a betrayal. Frank Lampard (left) closes down James Morrison during Manchester City's 3-0 win over West Brom. Lampard reacts after he hit the post during his side's victory over the Baggies at the Etihad on Saturday. It was not, and the reality is that Spain legend David Villa was always a bigger draw in a city with a huge Hispanic population. Regardless, some may now be questioning the logic of keeping Lampard in Manchester, rather than Manhattan, after the media storm the decision triggered. Since January 1, when the former Chelsea man was expected to cross the Atlantic, City have encountered choppy waters. Knocked out the FA Cup they are now six points behind Lampard's former club, out of the FA Cup and out of the Champions League. Not that he can be blamed for that. Lampard has made 30 appearances for City this season, but many of those have been cameos from the bench. At 36, Lampard was never intended to be a regular starter, but given the ferocity of the response to his extended stay, City fans may have expected more. Manuel Pellegrini has given the former England man just 190 out of 990 Premier League minutes following the turn of the year. In that period he has scored once, in a 3-2 victory over Sunderland on New Year's Day. Should City stage a miraculous defence of their title, that may prove key but it is unlikely. Even with Yaya Toure absent in Africa and his remaining midfielders looking like they were operating on separate Continents the Chilean was reluctant to turn to a man who has won more Premier League trophies than the club he plays for. Former Spain and Barcelona star David Villa (centre) in action for New York City. Lampard, belatedly, did start Saturday's 3-0 stroll over West Brom. He was steady and kept things ticking over before being substituted with the game long won. As Pellegrini pointed out after that canter, the season is not over and there are still 24 points to play for as they head into the final furlong. However, if the decision to keep Lampard here is to be justified he must turn more often to his thoroughbred.", "abstract": "Manchester City's decision to extend Frank Lampard's contract to the end of the season, rather than allowing him to move as planned to sister club New York City, left many questioning whether the powers-that-be in Abu Dhabi believed their new American operation was an inferior product.

The 18-year-old songstress, who is originally from Auckland, sent Irvine cupcakes and a touching note after he was roasted by British singers Natalia Kills and Willy Moon following his rendition of Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River on the show on Sunday. When giving her feedback to The X Factor contestant, Kills accused Irvine of copying husband Moon's style. Scroll down for video. New Zealand chart-topper Lorde sent Joe Irvine cupcakes and a handwritten note to show her support. Lorde is also from New Zealand and wrote: 'Just wanted to say: your individuality, positive energy and spirit are infectious!' Her comments, along with her spouse's, caused a social media storm, with people calling for their sacking. The network which airs the show, TV3, bowed to pressure and immediately fired the husband-and-wife duo. Support for Irvine came from all over the world, including from British singer Ed Sheeran, as people took to the internet, accusing Kills of copying the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga and Willy Wonka. But Lorde took it one step further and sent the humbled Irvine a box of cupcakes which spelled out 'Keep Being Joe' and a handwritten letter. 'Just wanted to say: your individuality, positive energy and spirit are infectious!' the Royals singer wrote. 'I think you're doing on awesome job on the show so far. New Zealand's The X Factor contestant Joe Irvine was berated by judge Natalia Kills for stealing her husband's style. But the tirade did not stop with Kills, her husband - Willy Moon - also dished out his own harsh criticisms.

Irvine tweeted his appreciate of the gesture on his Twitter account, which now has more than 12,000 followers. 'Hey you are awsome [sic] I love ur music and wanna meet you thank u so much for the cupcakes xo,' he said. It comes as users on Twitter point out Natalia Kills' own look is far from original. They have pointed out the Bradford-born singer appears to have drawn inspiration from a range of different artists including Jessie J, Lady Gaga and even Johnny Depp for fashion tips of her own. Kills launched into a tirade at Joe on the first of the live shows, saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelg\u00e4nger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband.' Natalia's comments seemed to be based around the fact Joe had his hair slicked back and was wearing a suit, a look favoured by her husband of ten months. Yet users on Twitter soon posted pictures that showed how Natalia's own  hair and make-up bears a striking resemblance to styles worn by Lily Allen and Elizabeth Taylor. Some of the the funnier comparisons include Johnny Depp in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Lord Farquaad from Shrek. She's even been compared to astrologer Mystic Meg and Lady Gaga. British singer Natalia Kills said she was 'disgusted' at the fact that she thought he looked like Moon. Twitter users were quick to comment on the fact that many of Kills' looks seem to have been influenced by other people, this hilarious example compares her to Johnny Depp in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Kills has also been accused of stealing looks from Lady Gaga, these two images show the two women rocking remarkably similar styles. In one picture comparison on Twitter, Natalia's bun, blunt fringe and cat eye make-up looks similar to a look worn by Lady Gaga. While other shots showed pictures of Natalia posing with her hand over one eye which echoed one of Lady Gaga's own photo poses. Another black and white shot of Natalia sees her posing with fingers pointing at her temples, miming having a gun pointing to her head. Singer MIA also posed the same way in a black and white photograph. But when asked about Natalia's look being similar to other celebrities' style, a spokesperson for her said: 'I have known and worked with Natalia for over 15 years - she speaks from her heart and says what's she's feeling.

They allegedly stuck up the store with at least five patrons and two employees inside. \"They said they thought it was going to be an easy target,\" said police spokesman Capt. James Clark. The store is in a quiet cul-de-sac. Williams and Hipps had not seen the police car outside, where Wilson's partner Damien Stevenson sat. Nor did they notice Wilson, who was in uniform. Wilson confronted them, and a firefight broke out, police said. The officer, an eight-year veteran, stepped away from others in the store to keep them out of the crossfire, police said after watching the store's security camera footage. He was a hero and a warrior, Clark said. \"He fought until the very, very end, firing at both of them.\" Hipps and Williams ducked out of sight at times behind movie posters as they trained their fire on Wilson, Clark said. Within 30 to 40 seconds, 50 shots fell, he said. \"Officer Wilson was shot multiple times in the body and once in the head. That is the shot that ultimately killed him,\" the captain said. With Wilson down, the two men ran out of the store, where Stevenson intercepted them. The officer wounded Hipps in the leg, and Williams ran back inside the store. He stood around, trying to act like he was just another customer when they arrested him, police said. He later gave them a confession. Both brothers have been charged with Wilson's murder and with attempted murder on Stevenson. The brothers told police that it was their first robbery attempt, but it wasn't their first run-in with the law. Williams, who is 26, has been arrested twice before, and Hipps, who is 30, six times, police said. He was released from jail in 2009, Clark said. In the brothers' home, police found an AK-47. The guns used in the robbery were bought on the street, police said. They want to find out who provided them. At the GameStop, residents have started a memorial, and it's growing, CNN affiliate KYW reported. At the 22nd police district, where Wilson worked, the flag hangs at half-staff. Actor Dan Aykryod, who was in town on a promotional tour, made a donation to Wilson's family and encouraged others to do the same. Wilson was 30 years old.

Pupils who do not take these so-called \u2018facilitating\u2019 subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious Russell Group universities, which often favour them. Bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher A-level subjects, a study shows (file picture) Researchers commissioned by the Department of Education at Oxford University also found poor children are much less likely to get three A-levels in any courses. The wide-ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery, reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil's chances of getting good results. Taking part in school trips and getting into a daily homework routine can also help them. The research is based on data drawn from more than 3,000 young people who have been tracked from the age of three for the Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education (EPPSE) project. Researchers found that just a third of bright but disadvantaged students took one of more A-levels facilitating subjects, compared to 58 per cent of their wealthier peers with the same academic ability. Less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a B in these subjects, compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates. The findings also show that just over 35 per cent of the sixth-formers identified as clever based on their test results at age 11 got three A-levels in any subjects, compared to 60 per cent of their high-achieving, richer peers. An analysis of the data found that sixth-formers who did two to three hours of homework each night were nine times more likely to gain three A-levels than those who did none. Less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a B in these subjects, compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates (file picture) The study said: \u2018Spending time on homework is likely to reflect both student motivation and engagement, study skills and independence, school policies and the priority teachers attach to encouraging students to study at home (or provide opportunities after school), as well as parental attitudes and support.\u2019 The study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure, educational trips, the chance to go to a good nursery and school, feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results. It suggests that bright, poor students should get \u2018enrichment\u2019 vouchers, funded through the Pupil Premium - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips, reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust which commissioned the report, said: \u2018The fact that bright disadvantaged students fall so far behind when they reach their A-levels shows that government and schools urgently need to do more to support able students from less advantaged homes. \u2018We must ensure that access to the best schools and opportunities for academic enrichment outside school are available to all students. It is also vital that schools advise their students on the right subject choices at GCSE and A-level so as to maximise their potential.\u2019 Professor Pam Sammons, co-author of the report, said: \u2018There is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools, the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education. There are important lessons here for teachers and policymakers seeking to reduce the equity gap in attainment.\u2019", "abstract": "A study by Oxford University has found that bright children from poorer backgrounds are half as likely to succeed in tougher A-level subjects than their wealthier peers.

Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev, who represents Potters Bar Parkfield, said the seven-hour flight was aborted \u2018because of a smelly poo in the toilet\u2019. Cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the smell became unbearable for passengers seated nearby, forcing the plane to turn around near Brussels and land at Heathrow Airport. A British Airways captain told passengers the smell was from 'liquid faecal excrement' in a toilet. Mr Sachdev, a Tory councillor, said the flight departed on time Thursday night and everything seemed fine until the captain made an announcement about 30 minutes after take-off. He told MailOnline Travel: \u2018The pilot made an announcement requesting senior cabin crew, and we knew something was a bit odd. \u2018About 10 minutes later he said you may have noticed there\u2019s a quite pungent smell coming from one of the toilets. \u2018He said it was liquid faecal excrement, those are the words he used. He said it\u2019s not a technical fault with the plane, and he was very adamant about that.\u2019 Hertsmere councillor\u00a0Abhishek Sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem.

{"article": "Scott Hoyle, 48, is on trial accused of killing a former Royal Marine who died when an alleged stunt in a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft went wrong. A former Royal Marine pilot killed his passenger after crashing his aircraft while performing a 'foolish and dangerous' loop-the-loop at a low height, a court has heard. Scott Hoyle, 48, allegedly carried out the acrobatic manoeuvre in his Tiger Moth plane, despite passenger Orlando Rogers being too big for the move to be carried out safely. The court heard how Hoyle, described in court as a novice, was'reckless' for attempting to perform the stunt at a height 'at which recovery was improbable'. Hoyle's 'risk-taking' allegedly caused the plane to nose-dive into a field near Witchampton, Dorset, killing Mr Rogers. The 26-year-old was a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. Hoyle, from Broadstone, Dorset, also suffered serious injuries during the crash, from which he has since recovered. He denies manslaughter and endangering the safety of an aircraft. Opening the case at Winchester Crown Court, Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution case is that the fatal crash was caused as a result of conscious risk-taking by Scott Hoyle, in that he flew the aircraft in a way which created an obvious risk of serious injury to Orlando Rogers, and Scott Hoyle either chose to disregard it or was indifferent to it. 'The prosecution submits that what he was intending to do was plainly dangerous and created an obvious risk of serious harm.' Mr Bowes told the jury of six men and six woman that, at 18st 7lbs and 6ft 2in, Mr Rogers' size placed restrictions on how the aircraft should be manoeuvred, something Hoyle should have known and made the flight unsafe. He said Hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft, making him a 'novice' in it, and that he was not trained to perform the loop-de-loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting. The jury was told the flight was the second Hoyle had flown from the Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset that day, having taken another friend up in his plane earlier. Mr Bowes said he had successfully completed several loops with the other passenger and that GPS tracking suggested he crashed near where these previous acrobatics had taken place. 'The location of the fatal manoeuvre and the improbability of Scott Hoyle's own account of the loss of control, and evidence from eye witnesses on the ground, all point to the fact that this was indeed an attempted loop,' said Mr Bowes. The plane crashed into a field near Witchampton, killing Mr Rogers. The 26-year-old was a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland and ran a maritime security company. Hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft, making him a 'novice' in it. He was not trained to perform the loop-de-loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting, the court heard. The court heard how the pair took off from the airfield at about 2.49pm, with the weather described as 'a pleasant spring day'. The fatal crash happened a short time later, at 3.08pm. Hoyle, who had a private pilot's licence, had flown 184.8 hours at the time of the crash, but only 35 hours in the Tiger Moth, making him 'inexperienced' in it. Mr Bowes described to the jury how eye-witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash. The plane, built in 1940, then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first. Mr Rogers was sat in the front seat of the plane, with Hoyle behind him. 'The prosecution say eye-witnesses saw the aircraft entering a loop,' said Mr Bowes. 'That point is absolutely disputed by the defence, who say it never happened. Thereafter the aircraft entered a spin from which it did not recover.' Eye-witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash. The plane, built in 1940, then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first, the court was told. Mr Bowes said Hoyle had 'no formal training in aerobatics.' He also told the jury the plane was flying too low to attempt a loop manoeuvre. When interviewed, Hoyle claimed he lost control of the aircraft due to 'a control restriction.' He said that following a left-hand turn, the rudder remained to the left. Hoyle told investigators who launched a probe into the flight that he pulled back on the stick in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft, which may have made it appear as though he was performing a loop. During his interview, Hoyle said he understood an aircraft needed to be at 3,000ft to 3,500ft to recover", "abstract": "Scott Hoyle, a former Royal Marine pilot, is on trial for allegedly killing his passenger, Orlando Rogers, during a stunt in a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft.

{"article": "A shocking report from investigators at the Social Security Administration has found that 6.5 million dead people are still listed on the benefit agency's rolls, listed at age 112 or older. Illegal immigrants and thieves are taking advantage, according to the SSA's Office of Inspector General. The IG set out to find out if death dates were being entered into computers for people who had 'exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies.' If found millions who the government officially considered at least as old as the oldest living human currently alive. US Social Security numbers belonging to 6.5 million dead people were still listed as active \u2013 not deceased \u2013 when the Social Security Administration's inspector general investigated. YOUNG'UNS: Some of the still-active SSNs belonged to people who were born before teh US Civil War. Former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano launched the 'E-Verify' system in 2011, which screens out illegal immigrants during hiring, but some have been using still-valid SSNs belonging to dead Americans. Bureaucrats never added their Social Security Numbers to the government's 'Death Master File,' so it's possible benefits have been paid erroneously for decades. The Gerontology Research Group reported in October 2013 that there weer only 35 people on earth who were confirmed to be age 112 or older. The inspector general did not say how many benefit checks were sent to the 6.5 million Americans whose Social Security accounts should have been closed out years ago. But the IG's report, just one page in length confirms only that payments have been 'terminated' for 410,074 of the affected accounts. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton told Daily Mail Online in a telephone interview that he was outraged by the possibility 'that there are dead people getting government checks.' 'Now we've got 6.5 million walking dead,' he said, 'and frankly \u2013 are these Zombie Americans voting? are they working? Are illegal immigrants using their SSNs to get jobs?' Indeed, 'thousands of the SSNs could have been used to commit identity fraud,' the inspector general's report concludes. 'We obtained information indicating a man opened bank accounts using several different Social Security numbers,' according to the IG, which said two of them belonged to people born in 1869 and 1893.' And between 2008 and 2011, employers trying to screen out illegal immigrants during hiring submitted 4,024 'E-Verify' requests to the federal government representing 3,873 people who used SSNs that belonged to people born before June 16, 1901. WIsconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told CNS News that it's 'incredible that the Social Security Administration in 2015 does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead.' Johnson chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The committee's ranking Democrat, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, noted that 'a few thousand' of the deceased people who still had active Social Security numbers were born before the Civil War. 'Preventing agency errors by keeping track of who has died is a relatively simple problem,' he said. 'WALKING DEAD': Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said the federal government si committing the same kind of fraud that would get banks shut down, by failing to ensure its money is spent wisely. IDENTITY FRAUD: Bureaucrats at the government benefits agency, located in Baltimore, Maryland, failed to enter Social Security numbers into the 'Master Death File' Fitton blamed the Obama administration, not just individual criminals, for the lapses. 'When you're an agency and you don't do what you need to do to make sure people aren't getting money they're not entitled to, that's fraud,' he said. 'If you were a bank and you didn't have the checks in place to make sure your money wasn't misused, you'd be shut down,' he said. 'Just ask HSBC what could happen.... when government agencies do it, they're just told to clean up their act.' 'Social Security is on the verge of bankruptcy,' Fitton warned. 'Unless it's fixed the whole thing collapses. The last they could do is make sure that 6.5 million people who aren't entitled to benefits aren't getting checks.' 'And it's not the dead people who are cashing those checks,' he said.

Van Gaal has made Carrick his vice-captain and the midfielder\u2019s impressive displays culminated in him creating the opening goal for Marouane Fellaini in last weekend\u2019s 3-0 win at home to Tottenham before scoring himself with a rare headed effort.

The 33-year-old, who joined United from Spurs for \u00a318.6million in 2006, was due to be out of contract in the summer but the club have exercised an option to extend it for another 12 months. Speaking at his weekly press conference ahead of Sunday\u2019s trip to Anfield, Van Gaal said: \u2018He is important. He can read the game as a player on the pitch so he can coach during the game but he can improve that, I think. \u2018And he is also a midfielder who can play the ball forwards and that I like because our aim is always passing the ball more forwards than sideways or backwards.

Colleagues said he would regular attended cigar clubs, the finest restaurants and even donated wine to the Guggenheim museum in the city. Alexander Chatfield Burns, 28 (pictured with friend Andrea Johnson) amassed a huge number of businesses, including several insurance companies, in his mid-20s. But is now facing an investigation after his companies reportedly lost $250million. Colleagues said he would regular attended cigar clubs, the finest restaurants and even donated wine to the Guggenheim museum in the city. But the financier is facing growing questions after he booked himself into Bellevue Hospital in New York a year ago and resigned from Southport Lane Management LLC, leaving a series of unusual asset transfers behind, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal reported. Regulators in Delaware say Southport under Mr. Burns siphoned off millions of dollars of mainstream insurance holdings and swapped them with assets that are either over-valued or worthless. Among them is a painting Mr Burns initially believed to be by Caravaggio, but was later discredited as a copy by three art experts. Since the probe he has moved into a historic building in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. The Journal reported that Mr Burns had two insurance companies, two offshore reinsurers, a brokerage firm and a web of dealings with other insurers. His massive portfolio left him in charge of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in additional assets. Regulators seized control of the two main insurance companies last April. One based in Delaware is being liquidated, one in Louisiana has been sold. The insurance-company losses total nearly $250 million. Regulators in Delaware say Southport Lane Management under Mr Burns siphoned off millions of dollars of mainstream insurance holdings and swapped them with assets that are either over-valued or worthless. According to court documents obtained by the Journal, the companies still active have tens of millions of dollars in questionable assets. James Denlon, a Louisiana Insurance Commissioner, told the newspaper Mr Burns 'apparently is convincing and good at snookering regulators.' Jeffrey Leach, a former president at Southport, told the Journal he wanted to be a'superrich guy'. 'His goal was to build this into a multibillion-dollar insurance operation,' he added. In statements sent through his lawyer, Mr Burns has called a lawsuit started against him by former employees Southport is 'baseless'. He blamed 'highly unexpected' events at the insurance companies which prompted a restructuring. He added that Southport complied with all relevant laws and that he doesn't face any litigation. Mr Burns has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not party of any criminal or civil proceeding.", "abstract": "Alexander Chatfield Burns, a 28-year-old Wall Street businessman, is being investigated over $250 million losses made by the insurance empire he set up.

The Gunners eventually saw off the challenge of the Irons, who suffered a third straight Barclays Premier League defeat, to move within a point of second-placed Manchester City with what was a eighth win out of the last nine. There is, however, little time for Arsene Wenger's men to recover before they must again raise themselves for the trip to Monaco and the quest to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit which has left their Europeans dreams hanging by a thread. Aaron Ramsey (left) races off to celebrate after scoring in Arsenal's 3-0 defeat of West Ham. The Wales midfielder reacted to Olivier Giroud's pass to finish for the Gunners' second goal. Ramsey hopes his side can take confidence from the game into the Champions League. CLICK HERE to read the full match report. Ramsey, who scored Arsenal's second goal on 84 minutes before substitute Mathieu Flamini tapped in a third moments after coming on, feels a similar positive approach can see them pull of an unlikely result at the Stade Louis II Stadium. 'We will go there and try to score three or more goals and hopefully not concede any, that is our target and is how we will approach it,' the Welshman said. 'We had a sloppy first leg and we have made it quite difficult for ourselves, but it is not over yet. Olivier Giroud has rediscovered his goal scoring form after missing chances against Monaco. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger watches on knowing his side will face a stiffer test in Europe. 'We are more than capable of scoring three goals. We scored three on Saturday and we believe in ourselves. 'So we will go into the game believing we can achieve that.' After seeing Theo Walcott, recalled into the starting XI for the injured Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, thwarted by some good reactions from West Ham goalkeeper Adrian - who played despite suffering a dislocated finger in the warm-up - Olivier Giroud eventually fired Arsenal into the lead on the stroke of half-time with a fierce left-footed shot drilled in off the far post. West Ham raised their game for the second half, but were unable to convert that dominance into a goal. Alexis Sanchez looks dejected as Monaco tie up a 3-1 first leg lead at the Emirates.

{"article": "Stressed-out adults are shelling out thousands of dollars to unwind at the world's first preschool for grown ups. The unique New York-based program, known as Preschool Mastermind, was created by Brooklyn resident Michelle Joni, who holds weekly sessions in her apartment, where her adult attendees are able to finger paint, sing, snack and nap. And, despite the hefty price tag, the new concept has already attracted a variety of New York's professional elite, from photographers and authors to corporate lawyers, all of whom are eager to forget the stresses of their everyday life and spend some time connecting with their inner child. Young at heart: Michelle Joni's Preschool Mastermind offers adults the chance to act like children. Arts and crafts: The preschool's grown-up pupils are offered a variety of traditional activities, such as nap time, art class and slumber parties. 'It is totally surreal,' Michelle, who goes by the name of Miss Joni when with her 'pupils', said of the success of her preschool. 'At the first class we had a nap time and all the grown ups laid down with their blankets and cuddled up in a ball. 'I just looked around and thought this is absolutely crazy - I cannot believe this is happening right now. 'We do all sorts of activities from show-and-tell to dress-up; we also play with Play-Doh have snack and nap time. 'It really is a preschool for adults and everybody loves it.' The classes, which are priced between $333 and $999 for a month-long course, depending on what each adult is able to pay, have been taking place once a week throughout the month of March, and are scheduled during the evenings, so that any working adult participants are still able to attend, after completing a full day at the office. And, just like a traditional preschool, pupils get the chance to enjoy a class picture day, a slumber party and even a parents' evening where they can show off their work. 'It's amazing, we say \"It's snack time\" and everyone is like \"Yay, snack time\" - then its nap time and everybody cuddles up together in a ball,' Michelle added. 'They totally get into it \u2013 it's really great getting in there and making things with Play-Doh and loving it.' Interestingly, the adults who attend Michelle's classes confess that they feel no embarrassment about taking the opportunity to revert back to their childhood selves - and some even insist that the classes serve as a perfect way of inject more fun into their lives. Put it all together: The classes are run by Michelle (pictured), who goes by the name of Miss Joni during school hours. Daring duo: Michelle (R) and her assistant Miss CanCan (L) both have a background in early child development. Tuneful melody: The preschool program also includes music lessons for participants. Lawyer Amanda Devereux, 33 is one such participant, and admitted that she attends the classes because they provide her with a forum in which she can try new things and experience some of the fun she used to enjoy as a child. 'I'm a litigator, I deal with securities litigation and complex commercial cases,' she explained. 'This is definitely a contrast from my job but I would like to think I'm a lot like I was when I was a child. 'I still like to have fun and try new things. 'My family are really into the idea and my work colleagues are not surprised I've taken the class. 'My mother just sent me a sweater for [my] class picture day with a note saying she used to pick out my clothes when I was four, so why not now?' Along with  lawyers from the corporate sector, the class also attracts mothers who want a break from their everyday obligations at home. Sarah Fader, 35, an author and mother-of-two, explained that attending the quirky preschool allows her to embrace her own inner child, after spending a day looking after the needs of her own children at home. 'Being a mom and taking care of children is very taxing,' she said. 'I wanted to get back to that feeling of freedom and childlike fun and wonder that I used to have. 'My children are seven and four and doing this grown up preschool reminds me of what it must be like as a child and helps me become a better parent.' Free and fun: Michelle believes that the classes serve as a form of therapy for the adults. Artistic expression: The adult attendees are even allowed to finger paint on the walls. Secret success: Michelle believes that each pupil at her preschool needs the chance to escape from their adult obligations. Preschool Mastermind creator Michelle believes that, for many of her participants, the classes serve as a form of therapy, allowing adults to deal with their real world problems from the point of view of their inner child.

{"article": "(CNN)There have been a few times in my career when I've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace. No, I certainly don't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing \"Kumbaya\" together in the office, but I'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me wasn't, when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be, when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear, anxiety or what have you. I'd love to say more about each of the women I've met along the way who fit those descriptions, but my point is not to single anyone out. My goal is to ask the question, \"Why?\" Obviously, not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior, but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up? I figured this would be a perfect question for Sophia Nelson, author of a new self-help book for women called \"The Woman Code,\" and she didn't disappoint. Unlocking 'The Woman Code': 4 tips to know your value. \"From the time we're little girls, we're taught to compete,\" said Nelson during a recent conversation at CNN. \"I need to be prettier, taller, smarter, my hair needs to be straighter, curlier, whatever it is. I need to get the better looking guy. I need to always be better than because we're taught to come from a place of lack as women.\" The way Nelson, an award-winning author and journalist, radio and television personality and motivational speaker, sees it, we women need to start operating like the boys. Men \"operate from a sense of, there's this whole pie, and I want my piece, and I don't care if he gets his piece, and maybe we even have to work together to start that business, start that company,\" said Nelson. Of course, it's easier for a man not to worry \"if he gets his piece\" since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate America, but that isn't the case for women. Today, just 5% of S&P 500 chief executives are women and only 14% of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women, according to a CNN Money analysis. Sheryl Sandberg teams up with NBA to get men to #LeanIn. Decades ago, the situation was even worse. When I was just starting my television news career in 1990, women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence. Naturally, many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job. \"Because they didn't think there could be ten of them, they only thought there could be one of them,\" said Nelson. \"Fast forward 20 years later. Now there... are a number of women partners at big firms, a number of women in Congress. I could keep going on and on so... there is a place for more of us.\" Which means we can lift as we climb, we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers, says Nelson. \"How exactly do we do that?\" I had to ask. Nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other. First, Nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about \"who's in your row.\" \"If you hear another woman say, and I've heard this, 'I don't do women friends, I don't have women friends,' believe her and leave her alone. I mean that, listen to me now,\" said Nelson. There are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women, so don't invest any time, if possible, with people who don't, she says. If you are in a meeting and you have a great idea, don't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself, said Nelson. \"Collaborate, share, collaborate.... So you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing.\" Competition is healthy and we can compete, but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues' playbook, she said. \"The guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of 'I want the dollars. I want to win the contract. I want to get the business.' We have to get in that same mindset.\" We're all busy but we've got to slow down and mentor, said Nelson. \"We have to build a bench,\" she said. \"Men do this well again. You've seen it in corporate, I've seen it. The guys go out and golf. They do things together and they're building up the next young man leader. Whatever field we're in... we're less likely to do it because we're busy. We've got", "abstract": "Author Sophia Nelson believes that women need to start operating like men in the workplace, collaborating and lifting each other up instead of tearing each other down.

The Canadian's whirlwind beginning to life at Blackburn looks set to continue with a starting spot on Sunday. Injury problems in defence prompted Rovers boss Gary Bowyer to take Henry on a month's loan from West Ham on Wednesday, the same day they played Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. Three hours after meeting his team-mates for the first time, Henry walked out onto the pitch at Hillsborough and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps Blackburn's play-off hopes alive. Doneil Henry made a good start to his Blackburn career after joining on loan from West Ham. Henry said: 'I got a call from the manager in the morning and I was told I was going on loan and I was hopefully playing that night. 'I had to collect my stuff from Upton Park, sign some paperwork and then be on a train. I got on the wrong train, asked the ticket man if it was going to Sheffield to find out I had to get off and get on another train. 'After that finally I recognised some people in Blackburn kit at the train station and from there I was in safe hands. I met the team, did pre-game stuff and then just played. 'I was just really happy to play. It's been a while. I knew me thinking too much wouldn't be good, I just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team.' Henry began his career at home-town club Toronto and joined West Ham in January after being recommended to Hammers boss Sam Allardyce by former Toronto manager Ryan Nelsen. Nelsen played for Allardyce at Blackburn, where he was captain and a hugely popular figure. Canadian international Henry joined West Ham in January from MLS side Toronto. 'It was funny coming to Blackburn and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards,' said Henry. 'Ryan has been a mentor since he came to Toronto. He really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey. I knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went. 'Junior Hoilett also played here, who's a close friend of mine, so I knew it would be a good move for me.' The 21-year-old has never been to Anfield before but did face Liverpool on their pre-season tour to North America in 2012. He knows securing the win needed to get to Wembley will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad. Henry played against Liverpool in America in a pre-season game - but has never been to Anfield. Henry said: 'I'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and I just thought they believed in me from the get-go. 'When we get the test on Sunday, I think we'll definitely be ready. There's a lot of quality players in here so I think if we can go there and do our job, as long as we stay together as a team, it's definitely possible to get a result. 'I'm not going to shy away from the opportunity. These are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level.' Bowyer is definitely without three defenders in injured trio Jason Lowe, Shane Duffy and Alex Baptiste, while Grant Hanley is a major doubt. But the Rovers boss has total faith in his new man, saying: 'Full credit to him and his character. 'He's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank West Ham for allowing him to come to us. Everybody at West Ham spoke very highly of him and his performance on Wednesday backed that up.

Freddie Roach (right, pictured in November) insisted on the guards having guns so that \u2018people respect them\u2019 Roach told the Associated Press that he insisted on the guards having guns so that \u2018people respect them\u2019 but the man himself will not be there to look after his charge until Sunday. The veteran trainer is in Macau preparing for Zou Shimming\u2019s first world title fight on Saturday before returning to Los Angeles where Pacquiao, now 36, will spar 90 to 95 rounds instead of the usual 150. They will both make the short trip downtown on Wednesday where they will be met by Mayweather for the only face-to-face meeting before fight week in Las Vegas. And Roach wasted little time in taking a swipe at Mayweather\u2019s father and trainer Floyd Snr. Pacquiao uploaded an Instagram post on Thursday undergoing some shadow boxing. Pacquiao's welterweight unification bout against Floyd Mayweather is expected to total $300million. \u2018Going against Floyd Snr is a little disappointing,\u2019 Roach said. \u2018He just isn\u2019t very good, especially during the fight itself. One of our advantages is having him in the other corner.\u2019 Roach also underlined his complete confidence in Pacquiao ending Mayweather\u2019s unbeaten record. \u2018Floyd is so disrespectful,\u2019 he said. \u2018Manny is the perfect role model for this fight and Mayweather is not. I told Manny we\u2019ve got to beat him for the whole world. There\u2019s no way we can\u2019t win this fight. Mayweather began training in his Las Vegas gym exactly two months before fighting Pacquiao. \u2018Floyd\u2019s legs don\u2019t move like they once did. He\u2019s very clever but the fight is so big he may feel like he has to take a risk and exchange with us. \u2018If he does that, that\u2019s the best thing in the world for Manny in my mind. \u2018Manny will be performing a public service for boxing when he beats Floyd.\u2019 Pacquiao has been training in Roach\u2019s absence and posted several videos on Instagram of his shadow boxing sessions. And despite showing off his blistering hand speed, he wrote: \u2018I feel slow but I\u2019m not worried because I still have a lot of time.\u2019", "abstract": "The Wild Card Boxing Club, where Manny Pacquiao is training for his upcoming fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr., is being guarded by seven armed guards.

{"article": "With millions of eligible men populating Tinder, how can you ensure that you get a right swipe? Ex-Coronation Street star Scott Wright is convinced he has the answer after conducting a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love. The actor, who played stripper Sam Kingston in the soap and was previously crowned Rear Of The Year, went on the world's most popular mobile dating app  with five very different looks. He wanted to see which profile would get the most'matches' - where women indicate they are up for a date. Scroll down for video. Ex-Coronation Street star Scott Wright, who played Sam Kingston in the soap, conducted a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love on Tinder. He wore five different outfits and discovered that going topless garnered the most matches (it probably helps that he's a personal trainer) By far the most popular of 40-year-old Scott's looks was when he stripped off for a topless profile picture. Within minutes of his profile going live, Scott had 28 matches from attractive women all eager to engage with the star, who now combines acting with a successful career as a fitness guru. This profile was seven times more successful that Scott's least popular profile - where he was dressed smartly in a work jacket and shirt, which attained just four matches. Once he posted each profile, he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives to gauge the popularity of each look. The 'chav look' was the second most successful of the five. Right:\u00a0Scott concluded that the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture, which, he says, perhaps explains why the 'normal bloke' look got 16 matches. Stylists created five different looks for Scott: smart, chav, hipster, normal bloke and muscle man. Once he posted each profile, he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives in Manchester to gauge the popularity of each look - and waited to see how many matches he achieved. The experiment was carried out over two weeks at Tinder's peak times between 6pm and 8pm - with Scott targeting different women so that the same women were not matching with him. Scott reckoned the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture. Scott's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches. That might explain why the 'chav' look, where Scott wore a zip-up top, tracksuit bottoms and trainers got 17 matches, and 'normal bloke' got 16 matches. Scott's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches. If Scott's experiment is anything to go by, dressing smartly virtually kills your chances of dating success with Scott's profile picture in a jacket and shirt getting just four matches. Scott made no mention of his previous TV fame because he just wanted to be judged on his pictures, though some Tinder users may have recognised him. The least successful of the lot was Scott's suited and booted look, which landed him just four matches. Speaking about his experiment, Scott said: 'Obviously because of my work in fitness I am in pretty good shape, so I guess it is no surprise that going topless is the best way to get matches on Tinder. 'I am thinking this strategy may not be be quite as successful if you have a beer belly and man boobs!. 'Seriously, what it shows is that online dating is a minefield and by making small tweaks to your profile pictures, you can significantly increase your chances of dating success.' A spokesperson for Theidleman.com, who provided the clothes for the experiment, added: 'What this shows is that men need to be comfortable in their own skin when they are dating online - and I think the same applies when they are dressing to look good. 'What most men want to do is pass the pub test: find clothes that look sufficiently good that their mates won't take the mickey out of them in down the pub. 'If they pass that test with their mates, they will also adopt the right look when dating online.'", "abstract": "Former Coronation Street star Scott Wright conducted an experiment on Tinder to determine what men should wear to get more matches.

{"article": "When Kerryn Barnett sat down at the dinner table with her family on Christmas Day, she had no idea that  she was about to eat  her last solid meal for three months. After suffering debilitating vomiting and extreme fatigue after the feast, the 36-year-old mother-of-three was diagnosed with severe gastroparesis, a condition that paralyses the muscles and nerves of the stomach. In the past five months, the Wollongong quality controller has shed a staggering 15kg due to the illness and is living on purely a liquid diet. Now she's been told by her insurance company Bupa that they will not pay for her life-saving surgery, leaving her facing a medical bill of $33,000. Kerryn Barnett (left) has not been able to eat a solid meal since Christmas lunch due to a rare condition called\u00a0gastroparesis. Nearly ten months ago, Ms Barnett knew something was wrong with her body when she lost her appetite and started experiencing nausea and bloating. 'I started to vomit after eating and then the weight started to drop quite rapidly,' Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Barnett went straight to the doctor, who took blood tests and conducted a pelvic ultrasound. The tests continued for four months, with Ms Barnett visiting two different specialists and a professor, testing out over 15 types of medication until finally she got a diagnosis. Gastroparesis is a rare condition which causes the stomach to stop working as it should. It results in the body being unable to digest or tolerate foods. The disease is extremely debilitating with constant nausea, daily vomiting, fatigue, muscle cramping, fainting episodes, abdominal bloating and reduced appetite taking over sufferers's lives. Ms Barnett has been forced to cut down the hours of her full-time job due to the extreme fatigue she experiences and has lost 15kg in just five months. Her main priority is to get out of bed in the morning and help her 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old twin boys get ready for school. The Wollongong mother-of-three, pictured here with her husband and children,\u00a0has lost 15kg in five months. Ms Barnett is terrified about her future, and is also concerned about how she is going to continue to care for her children. Then she will go back to bed and hope to make it up just in time to greet them at the door when they return. 'I feel absolutely exhausted because obviously none of the food goes down the small intestine, which distributes the food to different parts of your body, so I'm fatigued and exhausted at the moment,' she said. 'It\u2019s had a huge impact on the kids. 'I've got 8-year-old twin boys. One runs off to his bedroom crying every time I'm sick. I obviously try and be as discreet as I possibly can because some days the vomiting is so bad it\u2019s loud and I\u2019m running from one side of the house to get to the bathroom. It\u2019s a little bit hard,' she said. While she has explained her condition to her three children, Ms Barnett said she only gives them the information they need to know. 'I've\u00a0tried to sit down and explain that there\u2019s nowhere for\u00a0the food to go and that\u2019s why I start to vomit. 'I try to tell them as much as I can but not enough to scare them. 'I've\u00a0got one that\u2019s a bit emotional at the moment and the teachers are keeping an eye on them,' she said. Her diet now consists only of liquid. A typical meal for the mum would be soup or broth. On a good day she might try to hold down a smoothie with yoghurt. She is unable to drink Powerade without water, as it is too strong for her stomach to handle or any type of solid food. Going out to a restaurant is traumatic for the mother, as even if she limits herself to soup from the menu, she will more than likely be running for the bathroom after 20 minutes to vomit. The rare condition has paralysed the nerves and muscles of her stomach, but her health insurer are refusing to pay for life-saving surgery. 'I've got 8-year-old twin boys. One runs off to his bedroom crying every time I'm sick' Ms Barnett revealed. 'You kind of take advantage of the fact that you have the ability to eat, it\u2019s only when you can\u2019t eat that you realise how much food impacts on you life, even just the social aspect,' she said. 'Most of the time as soon as I eat, it\u2019s coming straight back up within 20 mins to an hour and I certainly don\u2019t want to be at a restaurant getting sick on\u00a0someone's\u00a0birthday. Due to the extent of Ms Barnett's weight loss and malnutrition, her only option is to try and treat the condition with a gastric neurostimulator", "abstract": "Kerryn Barnett, a 36-year-old mother-of-three, has been diagnosed with severe gastroparesis, a condition that paralyses the muscles and nerves of the stomach, leaving her unable to eat solid food.

She also agreed her husband is a \u2018dish\u2019, spoke about her faith, and revealed how she won the battle to give their three sons Spanish names. The Spanish lawyer, who uses her maiden name Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, used a series of interviews today to promote her Inspiring Women campaign to encourage school girls to reach their full potential. She said: \u2018This is not about famous women and celebrities This is about all women. When people say there are not enough women role models its because they do not realise that the role models are not necessarily always in glossy magazines. They surround me in the streets, right? \u2018I think this is too important the girls realise they can look for role models wherever they are. They are all there, they just need to look for them.\u2019 She lifted the lid on life at home with husband Nick and their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel.

The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Scroll down for video. Homes belonging to Leon Brittan, left, and the former head of the armed forces Lord Bramall, right, have been searched by police investigating child sex allegations, it has emerged. His comments came after it was revealed Met officers raided the homes of Tory grandee Leon Brittan and a former head of the Armed Forces last week. In a series of low-key searches, plain-clothes detectives examined Lord Brittan's home in Pimlico, central London, and his North Yorkshire country retreat. The rural property, near the picturesque town of Leyburn, is in the Richmond constituency which he once represented as an MP. The searches came just six weeks after the former home secretary died aged 75, triggering claims he attended VIP sex ring parties. Officers also attended the home of 91-year-old Lord Bramall, chief of defence staff until 1985. The Second World War hero won the Military Cross for bravery and rose to be Britain's top-ranking Army officer. The team of police, including at least one in body armour, were seen at his \u00a3750,000 stone detached property in Crondall, Hampshire, near the Army town of Aldershot. One onlooker said: 'They were here for most of the day. There were lots of cars in the driveway. I've no idea why they needed so many \u2013 he's an elderly man.' The searches took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. Former disgraced Tory MP Harvey Proctor, pictured, also had his home raided earlier this week by officers from Operation Midland. Detectives spent two days searching Mr Proctor's grace-and-favour home at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, pictured, after a police team arrived on the estate on Wednesday. Lord Bramall was head of the army from 1979-1982 before becoming Chief of the Defence staff - head of the whole armed forces - a position he held for three years. He first joined the army in 1943 and took part in the D-Day landings the next year. The young soldier was given the Military Cross at the end of the Second World War. Lord Bramall's glittering military career saw him promoted to lieutenant and sent to Japan in 1946, before serving in the Middle East during the 1950s as he climbed the ranks. He was given an OBE for his services to the Armed Forces in 1965, shortly before he was deployed to Borneo as commanding officer of the Royal Green Jackets regiment, where his actions were mentioned in despatches. He would later serve in Hong Kong before returning to Britain. In his role as Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Bramall played an integral role in planning the Falklands invasion. After retiring he was made a Knight of the Garter and, as a life peer, spoke out against invading Iraq in 2003. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.' The overarching Met inquiry into claims of historic sex abuse was triggered in 2012 when MP Tom Watson called for police to look again at allegations of a 'powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10'. At least six spin-off inquiries have been launched, with the most high-profile one investigating claims a VIP sex ring operated out of the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico. Lord Brittan had always denied any wrongdoing and after his death Tory colleagues lined up to defend his legacy. Ex-minister John Gummer, now Lord Deben, branded the claims 'wicked'.

{"article": "The BBC was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss Rona Fairhead to resign over her \u00a310,000-a-day second job at scandal-hit HSBC bank. It\u2019s a new blow to Mrs Fairhead, chairman of the BBC Trust and a non-executive director of HSBC, who is facing growing calls to quit one of her high-profile jobs over claims of a conflict of interest. She is due to be questioned by MPs tomorrow after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was paid \u00a3513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year, vastly exceeding her \u00a3110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the BBC. Last month HSBC came under fire over allegations that its Swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds of British taxes, and that it sought to influence media coverage. Silenced: Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon (right) who said Rona Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust, will not be shown. Now an HSBC shareholder has claimed the BBC refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that Mrs Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the Trust. Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon says he was invited to Broadcasting House in Central London to discuss the turmoil at HSBC in an on-the-record interview with a BBC business reporter on February 23. His interview failed to feature in the broadcaster\u2019s coverage of the HSBC story that evening. He believes it was shelved because of his remarks questioning Mrs Fairhead\u2019s fitness to run the Trust. He said: \u2018I said during the interview I disagreed with her appointment as BBC Trust chairwoman. \u2018I couldn\u2019t understand why a non-executive director who is there to protect the shareholders ignored us when we told her on numerous occasions in the past about illegal behaviour that was going on involving HSBC. \u2018It\u2019s my personal belief she\u2019s not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust. The HSBC item was shown, but my interview was not in it. I believe it may have been suppressed.\u2019 Mr Mason-Mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against BBC policy. Mr Mason-Mahon is well-known for his outbursts at the annual general meetings of big public companies. Last May he brought a lawsuit against HSBC\u2019s North American arm after it was fined \u00a31.2 billion having been found guilty in 2012 of allowing Mexican drug cartels to launder money. Last week former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland called on Mrs Fairhead either to give up her post at HSBC or to resign from the Trust. Tomorrow she is due to appear in her role as an HSBC Board member in front of the Commons public accounts committee, which has fiercely attacked tax-dodging corporations. Last night the BBC declined to say why the interview with Mr Mason-Mahon was not broadcast and whether or not Mrs Fairhead \u2013 who is not supposed to be involved in editorial decisions \u2013 was told about it. A spokesman pointed out that it was the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme that originally broadcast the highly damaging allegations about HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm and added: \u2018Like every news organisation we don\u2019t use every interview we conduct.

{"article": "A woman has sparked uproar on social media after enthusiastically bearing her K-cup breasts on Google Street View. Karen Davis from Port Pirie in South Australia was captured streaking by the Google camera cars for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. However the 38-year-old mother, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at 'flat-tittie chicks' claiming they are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts. In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. Ms Davis had issues with her siz-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I \u00a0always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.", "abstract": "A woman from South Australia has caused controversy after a picture of her bearing her K-cup breasts appeared on Google Maps Street View.

{"article": "A six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft. Baraka Cosmas was sleeping at his mother's house in Kipenda, Tanzania, on Saturday night when a group of men stormed in and grabbed him, police said. They beat up his mother before using machetes to cut off the boy's right hand. A six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in Tanzania in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft. The latest assault comes days after Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a 'disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation'. He said:\u00a0'I believe that with close co-operation between the government and society, we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame.' A police spokesman said: 'The\u00a0gangsters got hold of the victim's mother, Prisca Shaaban, and beat her severely after she refused to hand over the boy. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete (above) blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a 'disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation' 'The assailants later used machetes to cut off the boy's right palm and walked out.' Albino body parts are thought to sell for around $600 (\u00a3397) with an entire corpse fetching nearly $75,000 (\u00a349,685), a UN expert said. At least 75 albinos have died in the region since 2000. Earlier in the week four people were sentenced to death for the murder of 22-year-old albino woman Zawadi Mangidu. Tanzanian police on Monday banned a planned demonstration by the Tanzania Albinism Society in the country's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, citing security reasons. But Kikwete has said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings. The murders have been concentrated in the gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country's Lake Victoria, where superstitious beliefs are rampant. Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400 often as a result of inbreeding, experts said.\u00a0In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. Albinos are seen as curses, or 'ghosts' who can be wiped off the face of the earth in many parts of Tanzania. Families are often told to kill the children at birth. Yet, conversely, their body parts are highly prized. Witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches, power and success, if used in potions, while a UN report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets, or would bury them where they are drilling for gold. Fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish. Children are particularly vulnerable - their innocence is highly valued and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them. Most of the time, limbs are taken but a recent report noted that there have been cases where victims were beheaded, or had their genitals, ears, and bits of skin removed. Tongues can also be cut out or the eyes and the heart gouged out. Other types of attacks reported include rape for healing purposes. Possibly, most shockingly, some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed, the more potent the charm.", "abstract": "A six-year-old albino boy in Tanzania had his hand hacked off by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft.

{"article": "(CNN)Even with the national chapter shutting the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma, the school president said the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members. The members have until midnight Tuesday to get their things out of the house, university President David Boren said in a Monday afternoon news conference. \"The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,\" he said, adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members. A Saturday video showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization, which both promptly publicized the nine-second clip. David Boren: Not just another college president. The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant, \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" By Sunday night, SAE's national chapter had suspended the University of Oklahoma members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant, but Boren took it a step further. He appeared at a campus rally and told students over a bullhorn, \"I have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way. My message to them is: You're disgraceful. You have violated every principle that this university stands for.\" He said that he was angered, outraged and saddened by what he saw in the video. Boren stressed that the fraternity members' behavior is not indicative of what University of Oklahoma students, nicknamed Sooners, represent. \"It was unbelievable that this could have possibly occurred with UO students,\" he said. \"Sooners are not racists. They're not bigots. They are people who respect each other and care about each other.\" He called for zero tolerance. \"The only way you put a stop to it is have zero tolerance when it is found out. Clearly, I think some of our students wanted this exposed. They wanted this video out there, and I've asked them to please let me know when they're other things like this that happen,\" Boren told CNN. The student newspaper, The Oklahoma Daily, received the video in a Sunday email, said print Editor Katelyn Griffith. The fraternity celebrated its Founder's Day on Saturday, and the video showed members traveling to a formal event that evening, she said. \"We decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question,\" she told CNN. \"This was something that we knew wouldn't be tolerated by the students at OU and the university at large.\" Unheard, a campus organization launched in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, received the video Sunday via anonymous text and immediately moved to \"let our community and our university know that this behavior is not tolerated, that's it's unacceptable and it's extremely, extremely offensive,\" said the group's co-director, Chelsea Davis. This mentality is not new to campus, and it's not confined to one fraternity, Davis told CNN, but it's the first time people have been caught on video. \"Unfortunately, it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen, but this is definitely not something that is brand-new. It's not something that's only seen within this one organization,\" she said. Davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend, as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved. \"I was hurt that my fellow peers that I walk to class with every day, people that I see every day, could say such hateful things about me and my culture, about my friends, about my brothers and my sisters,\" she said. At a news conference, Boren said the school was looking into punishing the individuals involved, especially against those \"who have taken a lead\" in the chanting. While expulsion is an option, any punishment must be \"carefully directed\" if it's to pass constitutional muster. One key will be whether the offending students created a hostile environment on campus, he said. Boren emphasized that \"there is no room for racists and bigots\" at Oklahoma. \"I think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus, and I hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists,\" he told CNN later. That sentiment echoed throughout campus, as a large crowd of students attended a protest at the university's North Oval, some of them arriving with tape over their mouths with the word, \"Unheard,\" written across it. Other students took to social media to express their disappointment, with one person urging students to change their profile picture to an image that says in Sooner crimson, \"Not on our campus,\" the \"ou\" in \"our\" offset in gray. OU is shorthand for the University of Oklahoma. Unheard posted the video online Sunday with the comment, \"Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.\"", "abstract": "The Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma has been shut down by the national chapter after a video surfaced of fraternity members chanting a racial epithet.

But it also ruled allegations of murder and torture were based on 'deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility'. Now the government is gearing up to sue law firms for millions of pounds in legal costs and calling for the PIL's chief lawyer, Phil Shiner, to be struck off. The MoD's dossier, seen by at least two Sunday newspapers, accuses PIL and another law firm, Leigh Day, of continuing to pursue the case even after evidence emerged that the allegations may be untrue. It suggests PIL had doubts about the credibility of its clients' evidence as early as March 2013 but failed to withdraw the allegations for another 12 months, Tim Ross of the Sunday Telegraph reported. That led investigators to take evidence from around 100 further witnesses, costing taxpayers an extra \u00a3780,000, the paper reported the Government's dossier as saying. It is also alleged that PIL used a local 'agent' to trawl Basra for potential victims, a breach of a ban on solicitors touting for business that brought hundreds of extra claims against the Army. The Birmingham-based law firm even continued to represent one claimant in a separate judicial review after he admitted to Al-Sweady investigators he had lied about his sister dying on the battlefield, the dossier alleges. Leigh Day are accused of failing to disclose a key document for six years, according to the Sun on Sunday. Thorough investigation: British soldiers with an Iraqi detainee following the Battle of Danny Boy in May 2004. Claims troops rounded up civilians for a killing and torture spree following the battle were dismissed. The claims came after the Battle of Danny Boy on May 14 2004, a fierce firefight which erupted when insurgents from the Mahdi Army ambushed a patrol of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Their reinforcements, the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, were also ambushed and after three hours of fighting 28 Iraqi fighters had been killed. Claims which subsequently emerged that enraged British soldiers had tortured and executed innocent local people in the aftermath of the battle were dismissed by the Al-Sweady inquiry, which was named for an alleged teenage victim. Former 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment corporal Brian Wood has previously told the Daily Mail he felt he and his colleagues who fought in thad 'done the right thing'. Mr Wood, 34, who was awarded the Military Cross for his role in the battle, according to the paper, said: 'We have been dragged through five years of hell. That in my view is a betrayal of our service. 'We did what we had to do as soldiers and we did the right thing.' Ann Hoolin, 50, the mother of soldier Scott Hoolin, told the paper her son was 'upset and disturbed' following the inquiry. 'To be accused of wrongdoing in the aftermath of what happened is disgraceful,' she said. Battlegroud: The Danny Boy checkpoint, near where insurgents from the Mahdi Army ambushed a patrol of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, then their reinforcements, leading to a fierce firefight. Sir Thayne Forbes, the retired judge who led the Al-Sweady inquiry, did find that there had been instances of ill-treatment during 'tactical questioning' of the detainees at Camp Abu Naji, near Majar-al-Kabir in southern Iraq, on the night of May 14/15. These included depriving the prisoners of sight, food and sleep, and using threatening interrogation techniques contrary to the Geneva Convention. It amounted to ill-treatment and fell below the high standard to be expected of the British Army, Sir Thayne said. After Sir Thayne's report, Public Interest Lawyers insisted the inquiry had been 'legally necessary, morally justified and politically required'. Responding to a request for comment on the allegations against PIL and Leigh Day, an MoD spokesman told MailOnline: 'The MoD is assisting the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which is investigating issues that came to light as a result of the Al-Sweady Inquiry.' PIL said last night in a statement seen by the", "abstract": "A government dossier claims that human rights lawyers, Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), smeared British soldiers with false accusations of torture and murder of innocent Iraqis. The report, drawn up on the Prime Minister's orders, claims that PIL pursued claims against soldiers despite realising the allegations of abuse might have been 'untrue'. The government is now gearing up to sue law firms for millions of pounds in legal costs and calling for PIL's chief lawyer, Phil Shiner, to be struck off."}

{"article": "A 13-year-old girl who\u00a0underwent gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs and barely being able to move her body has completed her first 5K race a year after the life-saving weight loss procedure. Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, who suffers from\u00a0hypothalamic obesity, a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight, weighed 203lbs in 2014 despite being only 4'7. After she was denied weight loss surgery by her health insurer because she was 'too young', her parents started an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $86,000 to cover the medical costs. 'I still really believe the surgery saved her life,' her 35-year-old mom Jenny Shapiro told\u00a0People. 'I don't even know if we would be here. Seeing her do a 5K was just icing on the cake.' Scroll down for video. Making strides: Alexis Shapiro completed her first 5K race this month (pictured). Last year, the 13-year-old underwent gastric sleeve surgery to help her lose more than 50lbs. Last year, competing in a race would have been impossible for Alexis, who was almost always in pain because of her size. She began rapidly gaining weight after she sought treatment for her rare brain tumor in 2011; the surgery to remove the benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus and led to the development of hypothalamic obesity. After gaining 150lbs over the course of two years she developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems. Alexis had the life-saving surgery last March, but due to complications doctors were forced to perform a gastric sleeve surgery instead of the scheduled gastric bypass. Feeling better: Alexis, who suffers from\u00a0hypothalamic obesity, a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight, posed for the camera in a light pink crochet sweater last August. Puppy love: Alexis can be seen cuddling on the couch with her dog last month. She returned to school six months later after she lost more than 60lbs. But managing Alexis' weight is still a constant struggle. Her mom, who said 'hypothalamic obesity is a beast', admitted to the outlet that her daughter had since put eight to 10lbs back on her frame. Alexis continues to take steroids and growth hormones every day because her brain tumor surgery also left her with\u00a0panhypopituitarism, a syndrome marked by decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones. Getting stronger: The teen was photographed working out in the gym last May. Vacation time: Alexis was all smiles during a trip to the beach. Although the treatments make her feel ill and cause her to miss school at least once a week, Alexis is happier than she has been in a long time. 'Alexis has a confidence about her that she didn\u2019t have before,' Jenny said. 'She's gaining independence little by little and becoming her own person.' Jenny also noted that her daughter, who was once home-schooled, now has friends in her class. She maintained that, despite the ongoing complications Alexis is forced to deal with, the surgery was'really good' for her. 'I'm baffled by how well she does, especially at her age,' Jenny said. 'She's such a tough girl.'", "abstract": "Alexis Shapiro, a 13-year-old girl from Texas who underwent gastric sleeve surgery after gaining over 150lbs, has completed her first 5K race a year after the weight loss procedure.

{"article": "A spate of motor accidents involving tourists have prompted concerned New Zealand motorists to confiscate the keys of foreigners to prevent them from driving. Following the death of eight people  in crashes involving tourists in the past fortnight, five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area  which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy films. New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key said that 'people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible'. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident. Foreign drivers are involved in 37% of road crashes in the Westland District, on the South Island's West Coast, despite only 6% of crashes overall in the country involving tourists. 558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver, reported The Mercury. New Zealand Police's Assistant Commissioner of Road Policing, Dave Cliff, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0that the incidents of key confiscation were hard to police as there was no specific law relating to the issue. He reiterated that violence, even to prevent a tourist driving 'dangerously' would not be tolerated, 'and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences'. Assistant Commissioner Cliff's comments follow the assault of a tourist driving on the West Coast by a man who was unhappy with his driving. The tourist was punched in the face and had his keys taken from him, with local police labelling the incident unnecessary and 'nasty', reported The New Zealand Herald. 'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' said Mr Penman. 30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads. A family of four from Hong Kong collided with a logging truck, killing all in the vehicle. West Coast's Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn, said while there was definitely an issue in the area, he was worried that 'extremist behaviour' from local drivers were becoming more common. He labelled the violence 'disgraceful' and 'inappropriate', and called for greater driver education. The Assistant Commissioner assured the New Zealand public at the time that police were not complacent about driver safety, but urged people to contact police if they were concerned, rather than resorting to the confiscation of keys. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman, of Dunedin, took the keys of a Chinese couple when they stopped their car in the middle of a one lane road, and waited for police to attend the incident. 'I have no problem with doing it again. If it saves people's lives I have no problem with it,' he told The New Zealand Herald. 'I've been in a head-on crash before and I don't want to be in another one...Everywhere I have been people say 'good on you' for standing up,' Mr Penman said. 30,000 people have signed a petition, currently before Parliament, to force tourists to sit a safety test before being allowed to drive on New Zealand roads. However,  a Queenstown judge ruled on Monday that it was not the responsibility of rental car companies to assess the competency of drivers, and rather up to the individual driver to determine their own abilities. Earlier in the month a 39-year-old Taiwanese female teacher was charged with careless driving causing death and careless driving causing injury. 558 crashes involving tourists occurred in the past 12 months, with over 75% of the accidents found to be the fault of the foreign driver. Five incidents of key confiscation have been reported in the nation's South Island, an area which featured heavily in Peter Jackson's (above left) The Lord of the Rings trilogy films. She was driving to the airport in a rented van with six family members when she drove through a stop sign, causing the death of her father and seriously injuring her mother. Paul Whitmell, 57, and his wife Rosa, 54, were driving from Mt Cook to Te Anau, when they were involved in a head-on collision with Chinese driver Qian Li, 34, on Gibbston Highway on February 21. The British couple suffered serious injuries, and Li's passenger  Mingyue Shen was also injured, for which the judge sentenced Li on three charges of careless driving causing injury.

{"article": "After the Lord Mayor\u2019s Show on Saturday afternoon in Cardiff \u2014 where their title hopes will be crushed or resurrected \u2014 England will set about further diminishing the value of the old Calcutta Cup at Twickenham. Stuart Lancaster\u2019s team cannot lose. The notion of defeat is unthinkable, in an increasingly downgraded fixture. Last year, the Red Rose raiders left Murrayfield with a 20-0 victory and the scoreline fairly reflected the poverty of the Scottish display. If anything, it flattered them. England go through the motions in training as Courtney Lawes offloads the ball at Twickenham. Tom Wood passes the ball as England ran through their moves for the final time before the Scotland clash. England will be wounded after their defeat to Ireland, and are sure to bounce back by beating Scotland. Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup aloft after winning it at Murrayfield last year. Stuart Lancaster's men need a win against Scotland, and should get it against the wooden spoon candidates. Since then, Vern Cotter has brought Kiwi steel and some encouraging results, but Saturday's visitors are bottom of the RBS 6 Nations table after three straight defeats \u2014 the last at home to Italy \u2014 and they have not won in south west London for two generations. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister the last time Scotland left Twickenham as conquerors, in 1983. Since then, they have endured 32 years of failure at the home of their \u2018Auld Enemy\u2019 and this does not appear to be the occasion when that dire run is destined to come to an end. Andy Farrell summed up England\u2019s mood on Friday, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll be disappointed if we don\u2019t get the performance this week \u2014 and with that hopefully we could be able to keep the record going.\u2019 So, at the end of a week which began with Stuart Hogg bemoaning a lack of English \u2018respect\u2019 for Scottish rugby, the Lions full-back and his team-mates have a prime opportunity to regain it, by claiming a win which would amount to one of the upsets of the era. They will be desperate to salvage a crumbling campaign but England are also in wounded mode after their beating in Dublin, which derailed the Grand Slam bandwagon for the umpteenth year. Given the vast gulf in playing resources between the two nations, England would have the clout to prevail with three or four entirely different line-ups. James Haskell goes for a run with the ball as England prepared for the must-win fixture at Twickenham. George Ford works on his kicking as Danny Cipriani watches on during the final training session. Ben Youngs throws as pass as England's forwards look on, ahead of a game they should win easily. England could beat Scotland with three of four different XVs, and will have more than enough on Saturday. Scotland go through their paces at Twickenham on Friday - it's an important game for them to restore pride. That is not to denigrate the Scots; it is just a reflection of stark reality. Cotter\u2019s side have dropped to 10th in the World Rugby rankings, six places behind England who have shifted clear of fifth-placed Australia. Another defeat for Scotland would leave them in danger of being over-taken by Japan, while losing further ground on Samoa above them. So if Lancaster and his squad have any pretensions of mounting a meaningful World Cup challenge, this is a fixture with no safety net. They cannot lose, because to do so would shatter all hope of going into the tournament with their stadium regarded as a place where visiting teams fear to tread. Defeat would wreck the quest to create that fortress-feel at Twickenham and would also ensure that England could not rely on telling momentum to propel them into the showpiece event in September and October. It is quite feasible these nations will meet again in a World Cup quarter-final at the same venue on October 18. The thought of losing that one would be enough to give Lancaster sleepless nights for the next seven months. The last time Scotland beat England at Twickenham in 1983, Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister. John Beattie celebrates a Scotland try, but the Calcutta Cup has been devalued by England's dominance since. Fortunately for the head coach, he has a squad who are driven by a fervent desire to make amends for their loss to Ireland, and more than enough trump cards to ensure this is an occasion devoid of tension and a nasty shock at the end. What is crucially absent from the English armoury is an ability to shape their own championship destiny. In the hours before kick-off, they must decide whether to stay true to their pre-match plan involving a black-out of all news from Cardiff, where Wales can do them an almighty favour by ending Ireland\u2019s Slam crusade at the penultimate stage. Instead of being distracted by a game elsewhere which will all but confirm whether they remain in the title hunt, England", "abstract": "England are set to play Scotland in the Calcutta Cup at Twickenham, with Scotland having lost their last three games and sitting at the bottom of the RBS 6 Nations table. England, who are six places ahead of Scotland in the World Rugby rankings, are expected to win and cannot afford to lose if they want to maintain their reputation as a team that visiting teams fear to play against. The game is also important for England as they cannot afford to lose momentum ahead of the World Cup, where they could potentially meet Scotland again in a quarter-final."}

{"article": "(CNN)FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Iran to end its \"intolerable\" ban on women attending football matches. Writing in the FIFA Weekly magazine published by world football's governing body, Blatter described the situation as one that \"cannot continue.\" Iran's ban was put in the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their team without restriction. At the match against Iraq, activists unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against Brazil in 2014, and called for the ban to end. The measure was imposed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-Islamic. Iran is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the Asian tournament, for which the United Arab Emirates is also bidding. But the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event. Blatter wrote: \"I raised the topic at my meeting with the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term. \"However, nothing has happened. A collective stadium ban still applies to women in Iran, despite the existence of a thriving women's football organization. \"This cannot continue. Hence my appeal to the Iranian authorities -- open the nation's football stadiums to women.\" During last year's football World Cup, CNN reported how fans in Iran gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings. At one coffee shop in the capital, Tehran, the tense game against Argentina -- a game Iran lost only to an injury-time Lionel Messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd. \"100 percent it's better this way,\" said Negar Valayi. \"It doesn't happen often. It would be great if we have more of this.\" \"It's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited,\" said Roya Marzbahan. Hoardings advertising the World Cup throughout Tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women. And state TV broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored. Blatter also hit out at football's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body's executive committee. The committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the FIFA congress following a change to the statutes in 2011. \"This was hard work because the members of FIFA's executive committee are elected by the national associations... and there was never, never a proposal for a woman to be finally in FIFA,\" the 78-year-old said at an event in Switzerland. \"We had to take the decision, and I did it in 2011 at the end of the congress, [that] we must have at least one woman on the executive committee.\" He described football as a \"macho\" sport and warned: \"We should change in the future.\"", "abstract": "FIFA president Sepp Blatter has called on Iran to end its ban on women attending football matches, describing the situation as \"intolerable\".

One woman, a surgeon\u2019s daughter, sent a smiling selfie to her sister before entering Syria.

The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria from a medical base in Sudan.

From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman. The students are from the Sudanese community, but were born and raised in England. \u2018They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,\u2019 Turkish opposition politician Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said after meeting the families. \u2018We all assume that they are in Tel Abyad now, which is under IS control. The conflict out there is fierce, so medical help must be needed.\u2019 He insisted that the students wanted to volunteer in hospitals, adding: \u2018Let\u2019s not forget about the fact that they are doctors; they were there to help, not to fight.\u2019 It is believed the students had been enrolled in medical school in Khartoum. Last year, a British medical student who attended the same Khartoum medical school was arrested on suspicion of plotting with Islamic State. Tarik Hassane, 21, known to friends as \u2018The Surgeon\u2019, allegedly posted on Twitter \u2018I smell war\u2019 hours before his arrest. He was Tasered by police who stormed a relative\u2019s flat where he was sleeping after flying into the country. Three of the students had graduated and the others were still studying, it is thought. They were joined by two medics from the US and Canada, also of Sudanese origin.

{"article": "Moscow (CNN)Kim Jong Un is expected to attend World War II anniversary celebrations in Moscow at Russia's invitation, a Russian official speaking on condition of anonymity said Thursday. North Korea accepted Russia's invitation, but Russia is waiting on Pyongyang to make the official announcement about the May trip, the official said. This would mark Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership in late 2011. \"The invitation was sent to Kim Jong Un. North Korea accepted the invitation. The leadership of North Korea is expected to take part in Victory Day celebrations in Moscow,\" the Russian official said. The official later clarified: \"By leadership, we're talking about Kim.\" So far, North Korean state media has not issued any statement about the invitation. This year's Victory Day marks the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Chatter over whether Kim  would make his first official overseas trip during the pivotal anniversary started in late December after Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation to Pyongyang. On December 22, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told Itar-Tass: \"First signals are given from Pyongyang that the North Korean leader plans to come to Moscow and attend celebrations.\" Recently, Russia and North Korea have been fostering warmer relations. If Kim appears in Russia along with other world leaders, he may look like a minor figure, said Dr. Leonid Petrov, an Asian studies professor who specializes in the political history of North Korea. \"In a setting with a large crowd of state officials, in group pictures, he would look like a minor figure instead of what he's portrayed in North Korean media as supreme leader, invincible marshal, jack of all trades. \"So I think if Kim Jong Un decides to go to Moscow, he's going to look like a very lonely, lonely figure.\" The Kremlin has invited 68 world leaders to its Victory Day celebrations on May 9, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as quoted on Russian network RT. He was quoted in Russian media as saying that Chinese President Xi Jinping will also attend. In the last year, Russia and North Korea, two historical allies, have increasingly established stronger ties as Russian President Vladimir Putin faces international backlash over the war in Ukraine. The two countries declared 2015 their \"Friendship Year.\" Both countries have been slapped with sanctions by the United States and are facing international isolation. \"North Korea is a convenient friend for Moscow -- it's anti-American and it's in a key place of Asia,\" Petrov said. \"Russia lost many of its traditional allies -- it needs friends, both economically, politically, strategically.\" Ties between North Korea and Russia date back to World War II, when Kim Jong Un's grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il Sung, trained as a communist guerrilla leader in the Soviet Union. Throughout Kim's subsequent reign, the Soviet Union backed the nation. After the Soviet Union crumbled in the early 1990s, North Korea became increasingly reliant on China. Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, visited Moscow several times, with his last visit in 2011. The late Kim rode into Russia in an armored train (he disliked flying) and met with both Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. \"Moscow undertook a diplomatic offensive\" with North Korea, said Petrov, of Australian National University. \"It absolved $10 billion of Soviet-era debts from the account books and started rebooting relationships between North Korea and Russia.\" Last year, Russia forgave 90% of North Korea's $11 billion debt. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported in Moscow, and Madison Park wrote and reported in Hong Kong.

{"article": "On reflection, it would be wrong to describe inter-squad relations back then as frosty. Cordial might be more appropriate. Yet the warmth was distinctly a few degrees south of what Steven Naismith is currently enjoying each time the Scotland squad gathers on the banks of Loch Lomond. The reasons for the dawning of an age of bonhomie are not too hard to fathom. In little over two years, Gordon Strachan has transformed the national team from a laughing stock into a source of genuine pride and hope. One that people naturally want to be part of. Awkward conversations between players who would much rather be elsewhere are conspicuous by their absence. A sense of togetherness - which can only truly be fostered by a string of positive results and performances - is palpable. The Scotland squad are in high spirits in the lead-up to their clash with Northern Ireland on Wednesday. Naismith says: 'From when I joined the national team to now, it\u2019s a totally different dynamic' The old clich\u00e9 about a club-like atmosphere surrounding Team Scotland \u2013 for so long just empty rhetoric \u2013 now has a solid basis in reality. \u2018From when I joined the national team to now, it\u2019s a totally different dynamic in that every single player is chatting away to anybody,\u2019 said Naismith. \u2018It\u2019s just normal. We\u2019re a bunch of guys who are at similar points in life \u2013 starting families, getting married but all driven. Seeing what we have here and what we can do is what\u2019s driving everyone. It\u2019s great that we\u2019re all of similar mind-sets and it works. \u2018(Previously) I wouldn\u2019t say it was as tight as it is now. Everyone wasn\u2019t as open as they are now. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say there were cliques and people not talking to each other. But the Rangers boys and the Celtic boys did tend to stay together. It\u2019s just who you are familiar with. \u2018Now everybody is just a bit more open. So many more of us get on and will be texting each other outwith football. It just brings people closer.\u2019 For much of Naismith\u2019s Scotland career, a call-up to the national side brought mixed emotions for many. Gordon Strachan's reign has brought back a sense of pride to the Scotland shirt. At times, the pride of being selected to pull on a dark blue jersey was diminished by a realisation that the team was going nowhere fast. Frequent numerous call-offs just became the way of things. Many of those who did assemble for duty wore the look of men who wish they hadn\u2019t bothered. Not now. Naismith says there are no cliques in the side. \u2018Most folk will hang about in the communal areas and chill and enjoy banter,\u2019 he added. \u2018In the past, people maybe went to their own room or someone else\u2019s room in twos or threes. \u2018Now you could walk through the hotel and see eight or nine guys mixing \u2013 and it\u2019s always a different mix. \u2018The manager has not directly encouraged it but the way he operates being so open and honest rubs off on the way we behave and work together.\u2019 It says much that only Ross McCormack has withdrawn from Strachan\u2019s original party to face Northern Ireland on Wednesday  and Gibraltar on Sunday. Hardly fixtures that necessitate a dose of tranquillisers to calm the pulse of the Tartan Army, but tellingly viewed by the entire squad as matters of the utmost importance. \u2018It\u2019s a very good game as we\u2019ve both started our campaigns very well,\u2019 Naismith said of Wednesday's Hampden friendly. \u2018It\u2019s a game with a little more to it, like Ireland and England, because they are close to home and the players are all familiar with each other. It\u2019ll be a very good test. It\u2019s an opportunity to try a few things and refresh the minds of what we\u2019ve been doing because we\u2019ve not been together for a period or four or five months.\u2019 For Naismith, this match is also a case of Friends Reunited. Both Steven Davis and Kyle Lafferty shared a dressing room with him at Rangers for four years with three Scottish titles gleaned in that period. Norwich striker Lafferty didn\u2019t have his troubles to seek at Ibrox initially but his latter contributions \u2013 together with his current displays for club and country \u2013 have long since convinced Naismith of his value to any side. Naismith will be reunited with friends Kyle Lafferty, who who played with during a successful run at Rangers. He will also compete with Steven Davis, another former Rangers star now on the Southampton books. \u2018Ever since he was at", "abstract": "The Scotland national team has transformed under Gordon Strachan's leadership, from a laughing stock to a source of pride and hope, resulting in a strong sense of togetherness among the players.

Paul Ceglia, 41, of Wellsville, sued the social network's billionaire founder, Mark Zuckerberg, in 2010, claiming he had been promised a 50 per cent share in the business in exchange for start-up money. In 2012, he was charged with fraud after federal authorities said he had fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against Zuckerberg, 30. He was due to go on trial on May 4.

Lawsuit: Paul Ceglia (left), 41, who sued Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg (right), in 2010, has vanished from his home just weeks before his New York-based trial after ditching his ankle tracking bracelet, it has emerged. Speaking to Reuters, Fogg said Ceglia's tracking device had been found at his home, in New York's rural Allegany County, after the U.S. Marshals Service was dispatched to check on him on Sunday. He said he has not heard from Ceglia, adding that U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick has now \u00a0scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday that was'most definitely spawned by the recent event'. Last April, Buffalo federal judge Richard Arcara\u00a0officially closed the book on Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it. The ruling affirmed a magistrate judge's recommendation from a year earlier, saying  the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract Ceglia had based it on was faked. Ceglia had claimed that he and Zuckerberg had signed a contract, 'The Face Book', that included a provision entitling him to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for start-up money for the firm. At the time, Zuckerberg was a freshman at Harvard University. Although Facebook's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract, they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit.

Claims: Ceglia - who claimed he had been promised a 50 per cent share in Facebook (pictured) - was due to go on trial on May 4. However, he is now missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet. Zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for Ceglia's company, StreetFax.com. The lawyers argued that the the only valid contract between the pair related to that company. At the time of Ceglia's arrest,\u00a0Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.' 'The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud,' attorneys for Mr Zuckerberg and his Palo Alto, California-based company added. 'Zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to Ceglia's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails.'

Burton Gersh, 69, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in 2010. He asked a federal judge to allow a'mistake-of-age defense' in his pending trial in which he faces pornography charges. Burton Gersh (pictured above) is accused of producing\u00a0hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in the fall of 2010 with accomplice Les Sidweber. The former seafood wholesaler also requested in a motion filed in federal court that jurors know the girls engaged in prostitution, according to USA Today. A federal prosecutor is reportedly fighting both requests. 'The alleged victims appeared to be over the age of 18 and both were strippers in a club in Philadelphia, presumably fooling a legitimate business about their age,' the motion from Gersh's attorney, Michael Engle, said. The motion adds that Gersh'may not have reasonably been able to ascertain the alleged victims' ages because of their misrepresentations, physical appearance and stated occupation'. 'At least one' of the girls was given a release form to sign before the photo school, the motion said. Signing the motion would indicate 'that she was 18 years of age or older'. Gersh and his accomplice, photographer Les Sidweber, 73, were arrested and have been in federal custody since November 3. Their trial is set for May 19. One of the girls was allegedly approached while walking out of her school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Lappen told CBS Philadelphia\u00a0in November.

The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court claims that Gersh and Sidweber paid for the two Pennsylvania girls to come to their homes, strip naked and perform sex acts on one another and on Gersh. 'Once these men earned the trust of these victims, they exploited them on multiple occasions,' Lappen said. The illicit pictures show identifiable characteristics of Gersh's home, including one with a backyard gazebo that featured a sign 'Welcome to the Gershs', investigators told CBS Philadelphia. The defense claims that knowledge of the ages of the girls is crucial if Gersh is found guilty of 'purposefully' producing the child porgography. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan, however, said the mistake-of-age defense should not be taken into account. 'Knowledge that the victim was under the age of 18 is not an element of the crime,' Morgan said in a motion. She also said that allowing testimony on the victims' sexual experiences would be irrelevant and 'can only be used to cast aspersions on the character of the victims'. Gersh and Sidweber face 15 years in prison if convicted.", "abstract": "Burton Gersh, a millionaire from New Jersey, accused of making child pornography with two teenage girls, has asked a federal judge to allow a 'mistake-of-age defense' in his pending trial in which he faces pornography charges.

{"article": "Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief of staff has come under fire yet again for her controversial decision to ban Labor appointments from retaining their positions on government boards. The move by Peta Credlin has been derided by the business community  as 'unrealistic' because nearly all of the directors on government boards were employed during Labor's six-years in government. Speaking at an Australian Institute of Company Directors lunch, chairman of CSIRO, Simon McKeon confirmed the ban on Labor appointees to government boards, claiming he will lose his position when his contract expires in June. Scroll down for video. Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief of staff, Peta Credlin (pictured) has come under fire yet again for her controversial decision to ban Labor appointments from retaining their positions on government boards. 'Labor was in power for six years. Virtually everybody currently serving on the boards of government bodies was either appointed or reappointed while Labor was in power,' Mr McKeon said. 'If Abbott persists with his policy, there will be a full clean out of directorships.' 'The reality is that, yes, there is a rule that no one on the board of a federal government agency has been reappointed,' Mr McKeon said. 'It's an issue that many people are finding worrying.' Mr McKeon, who is also chairman of AMP, said the policy was at odds with what the AICD and Business Council of Australia subscribed to as good governance. 'My understanding is that there are many people like me who are disappointed with this quite brutal rule,' he said. 'I haven't come across anyone actually in government, let alone in private enterprise, who says `oh this is a wonderfully good initiative'.' Takeovers Panel member and Telstra director Dr Nora Scheinkestel said the panel's size had been significantly reduced as members had not been reappointed when their terms came up. In February, it was revealed that Peta Creddlin was at loggerheads with top Cabinet Ministers over her attempts to micro manage Julie Bishop and steal Joe Hockey's thunder. 'The reality is we lost a lot of people who brought great expertise, major institutional investors, investment bankers etc, and I think it's to the detriment of how the panel functions.' Mr McKeon said Australia needed excellent people on these challenging boards. 'The last thing we want to be doing is to one kick them off after three years, let alone send a very strong message saying this is the way it ought to be.' Dr Nora Scheinkestel, a director of Telstra, said she was strongly against the rule, as was chairman of BlueScope Steel Graham Kraehe. McKeon is a former Australian of the Year and is coming up for reappointment in following months, like many of his colleagues. Many of them are part of the boards for humanitarian or charitable reasons. 'My understanding is that there are many people like me who are disappointed with this quite brutal rule,' he said. But Abbott's devotion to Credlin is unmoving. The prime minister has defended her time and time again, calling her 'the fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with' In February, it was revealed that Peta Creddlin was at loggerheads with top Cabinet Ministers over her attempts to micro manage Julie Bishop and steal Joe Hockey's thunder. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is understood to have been involved in a feud with Credlin after her extensive attempt to micro manage the government included controlling minister's media appearances. Meanwhile, Treasurer Joe Hockey's grievances with Credlin are also understood to have stemmed from her tendency to over-step her mark and take control. At a small celebration following the release of the party's first budget, Credlin undermined the Treasurer by having the first word - leading the toast, and ultimately taking ownership of an accomplishment that should have been Hockey's to savour. But Abbott's devotion to Credlin is unmoving. The prime minister has defended her time and time again, calling her 'the fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with'. He is known to have told associates that raised complaints against her: 'you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Peta'.

Sean O'Driscoll's Young Lions trailed twice, to goals from Marcus Ingvartsen and Robert Skov, but hit back through Izzy Brown, Demarai Gray and Ashley Smith-Brown to claim an important win. England are in an Elite Round mini-group with Denmark, Azerbaijan and France as they bid to reach the Under 19 European Championship finals in Greece in July. Manchester City's Ashley Smith-Brown scored the winner as England's under 19s beat Denmark. With only the group winners qualifying for the tournament, it was imperative England started with a positive result in Bayeux, northern France and they did in a topsy-turvy game that saw both sides finish with 10 men. Having scored 15 goals in three matches against Belgium, Luxembourg and Belarus to breeze through the preliminary qualifying phase, England knew this week's fixture would represent a step up in quality. And they were rocked when Denmark took the lead just six minutes in - after the England defence failed to deal with a long throw-in, Ingvartsen was there to poke the ball home at the back post. England responded by seizing control of possession, but it was the half-hour mark before they equalised. Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek threaded a ball through to club-mate Brown and, brushing aside two Denmark defenders, he slotted the ball past goalkeeper Daniel Iversen. Brown came within inches of putting England in front soon after, but his powerful strike from 20 yards cannoned back off the crossbar. Izzy Brown, seen here playing for Chelsea in the FA Youth Cup, scored England's first goal. And when Fulham star Patrick Roberts teed up Loftus-Cheek, his shot was cleared off the line by Stefan Gartenmann. Given their dominance, it was frustrating that Denmark took the lead again four minutes before half-time. After a well-worked move, Skov found space just outside the box and fired past goalkeeper Angus Gunn into the far corner. To their credit, England responded immediately and it was 2-2 at the pause. Roberts swung in a free-kick from the right and Gray, the Birmingham City player, flicked in at the near post. After the excitement of the opening 45 minutes, the game entered a lull after the break before exploding to life again in the decisive final 10 minutes. Man City defender Smith-Brown collected the ball wide right, cut inside and fired home a missile from 20 yards that crashed in off the underside of the bar. The game ended with England's Harry Winks receiving a second yellow card and Denmark's Jeppe Hansen also dismissed for a bad tackle on Charlie Colkett. England's second qualifier is against Azerbaijan on Saturday. Sean O'Driscoll's team now play Azerbaijan and France in their other European Championship qualifiers.

{"article": "CDC officials have arrived at a Louisiana research center to try to determine how at least seven monkeys became exposed to a deadly bacteria used in bioweapons. Three of the monkeys had to be euthanized after showing signs of the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre Tulane National Primate Research Center, USA Today reported. Despite thorough investigations by authorities, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened. Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required. Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died. Potentially deadly:\u00a0Burkholderia pseudomallei. The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.", "abstract": "At least seven monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the center.

William Hanna, 65, and Dianne Whitehouse, 59, were previously convicted of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography for their offences with a 'damaged' 15-year-old girl at a Birmingham hotel. Both were also convicted, and jailed, for sexual activity with the vulnerable teenager. Cleared of charge:\u00a0William Hanna, 65, and Dianne Whitehouse, 59, had their convictions of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography overturned as their live streaming of sex sessions was not permanent. But after the pornography ruling was quashed by the Court of Appeal, a retrial at Birmingham Crown Court ended with a jury being directed to return not guilty verdicts. The ruling came after it was judged the live streaming of the pair's sex sessions with their victim did not fit the legal definition of pornography, which must be recorded in a permanent form. Directing the jury to clear the pair, Judge Richard Bond said: 'These defendants have been convicted of sex offences. 'In regards to these charges it is a legal technicality we are dealing with it is important if someone is going to be convicted there are convicted on what the law states. 'The law says this offence can only be committed if data being streamed is recorded. There was no recording in this case, and if there was no recording then the offence is not made out.'

Girlfriend Whitehouse was jailed for six years after being convicted of two charges of the same offence. Their trial heard how they met their victim online before 'degrading' her in sessions at the Etap Hotel, off Bristol Road, Birmingham which were streamed live on the internet. In one session a man dressed in a catsuit entered the room and had sex with the teen. Jailing the pair in 2013, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said Hanna and Whitehouse had taken advantage of an 'intensely troubled and damaged child' and'relished' her young age. He told them: 'You treated her not as a damaged child who needed protection, but as somebody who could be simply used as you wished. 'You involved her in sexual activity which must have had the effect of damaging her even further.' Of the live streaming, the judge said: 'In addition to the degradation of that child, she knows an unknown number of people have had the opportunity to view that degradation.' A third man, Ian McGlasson, 49, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions. He admitted six charges of sexual activity with a child, two of meeting a child following grooming and possessing and taking indecent images.

'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX.\u00a0'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.' When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would. However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose. Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail. Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection. 'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.' Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on. 'Not recognizing Juan Martinez is like saying you don't recognize Mickey at Disney,' tweeted @Kristyannasmom.

Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago. Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing.

'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement.

{"article": "(CNN)As the seventh full week of testimony in the first-degree murder trial against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez came to a close this week, witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing. Hernandez is on trial in Fall River, Massachusetts, in connection with the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. The former tight end had signed a five-year contract extension worth $40 million but, less than a year later, Hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fianc\u00e9e. Hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team. Two of Hernandez's closest associates are co-defendants in the case. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. He is accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, allegedly over a spilled drink. Two witnesses who saw Hernandez at the Boston nightclub Rumor just 48 hours before Lloyd's killing said he looked angry and aggressive. Lloyd was with Hernandez at the club that Friday night. On Thursday, prosecutors called witness No. 100: Kasey Arma, a nightclub promoter. She told jurors she danced with Aaron Hernandez at the club in the early morning of June 15, 2013. Hernandez approached her. \"He walked by me and he tapped my hip.\" Arma testified that she danced with Hernandez for about 10 minutes. \"He was pleasant and kind of charming,\" she said. Then he left abruptly. When he returned about 10 minutes later, Arma said, Hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club. His demeanor changed. He was \"very aggressive,\" she testified. Then, she said, he asked her \"to show what I could do with that thing,\" referring to her backside. \"He was irritated and very aggressive,\" she told the jury. During cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Fee showed surveillance video of Arma dancing with Hernandez. There was bumping and grinding, mostly with her backside to him. It was uncomfortable to watch in court. Jurors watched the video with laser focus. Fee asked Arma, \"What kind of dance is that called?\" Arma said she didn't know. Some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly. Earlier in the week, witness Kwami Nicholas testified that he also saw Hernandez at Rumor and the ex-player \"seemed like he was angry about something.\" Hernandez's mouth looked like a \"grunt,\" he said. Nicholas, a college student, was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with Lloyd. When Lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends, Hernandez looked angry, according to Nicholas. Hernandez was standing near the DJ at the time, about 15 feet away from Lloyd and his friend. Nicholas said Hernandez glared at them for a few minutes. During tough questioning from Fee, Nicholas stood his ground. The defense showed jurors Nicholas' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of Hernandez. Nicholas also remembered Hernandez \"storming out of the club.\" \"He looked angry,\" Nicholas told the jury. As Hernandez walked down the street, \"he motioned back with his arms as if to say get away from me.\" Prosecutors played surveillance video backing up Nicholas' description. During that video, Lloyd is also seen following Hernandez at a distance. Though prosecutors are trying to establish that Hernandez was angry, jurors still don't know why. Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e and mother of his baby daughter, was not in court to see the dirty-dancing video. She hasn't been seen in court since March 6. But Jenkins' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from Hernandez's house in November 2014. Jurors were not present for that debate. The prosecution showed before-and-after photos of a closet in Hernandez's home in North Attleboro. One photo from June 2013 showed the sneakers Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was killed. It also showed the shoes Hernandez associate Carlos Ortiz wore the same night. The two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes. In the second photo, taken in November 2014, the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones Hernandez and Ortiz were wearing the night of the shooting. They were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house. Prosecutors wanted to link Jenkins to the disappearance of the shoes. McCauley referred to the defendant's jailhouse comments that \"she does what I want,\" referring to Jenkins. McCauley also told the judge that Hernandez \"was directing her (Jenkins) to give money to Tanya Singleton at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk.\" He added, \"We know she didn't talk and then was held in contempt.\" Tanya Singleton is Hernandez's cousin", "abstract": "Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez is on trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was found dead in June 2013.

{"article": "Andreas Lubitz's fear that he was going blind - thought to be the reason for him deliberately crashing the Germanwings jet - may have just been in his head, it emerged today. The killer pilot had reportedly been living 'on the edge' because he feared his deteriorating vision, possibly due to a detached retina, would cost him his pilot's licence. But investigators now believe his condition was simply a nervous, psychosomatic disorder and not physical at all. Doctors say the symptoms brought on by stress can be cleared up with rest and therapeutic drugs, raising the\u00a0harrowing scenario Lubitz needlessly took his own life and those of 149 others. An investigator close to the criminal investigation: 'If this is indeed the reason why he killed himself, and all those others, then he may have chosen to die for entirely the wrong reasons. 'He lived for flying and was terrified that he would lose his pilot's licence. In his mind that would have been worse than death.' Scroll down for video. Madness: Lubitz was 'on the edge' over his deteriorating eyesight, fearing it would cost him his pilot's licence. Health issues: Lubitz, 27, pictured masked his true condition from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was. Detectives and prosecutors will examine the hitherto sealed medical files of the University Clinic of Dusseldorf to see if his complaint really was all in the mind. But these are often linked to psychosomatic disorders. The Internet is filled with chatrooms where people who thought they were going blind were relieved to find anxiety, stress and depression behind their problems. His aunt Brigitte W, today said she was unaware of Lubitz's health problems\u00a0only knew him as a normal and happy man. The\u00a079-year-old told Germany's BILD newspaper: 'I knew nothing of mental health problems and eye problems. 'When we celebrated family celebrations, he was happy. He never spoke of stress at work. 'We were proud of him, that he fulfilled his childhood dream.' She added: 'He flew intentionally into that mountain ridge. It is difficult for the family to cope now.' It is understood Lubitz complained of blurred vision involving dark spots in front of his eyes, halos and flashes of light, causing him to misjudge distances on occasions. It was claimed yesterday that Lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight, possibly because of a detached retina - with his vision already restricted to 30 per cent. The condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients - and is often marked by flashes in the eye. Rescue workers are seen examining debris at the crash site of the Germanwings jet near Seyne-les-Alpes. Perilous: French Gendarme Bruno Hermignies stands by a bulldozer clearing a path to the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 in the mountains near Seyne-les-Alpes as the recovery operation continues. It also emerged today that Lubitz had been treated for'suicidal tendencies' several years before becoming a pilot and trawled gay porn websites in the days before his death. German prosecutors revealed Lubitz had previously received psychotherapy 'with a note about suicidal tendencies' several years ago before he became a pilot. Speaking of the complex operation to build a complete psychological profile of Lubitz in the days before the crash, the police source in Dusseldorf told International Business Times that investigators have been trawling through his internet usage. 'We have a team disassembling his computer, and that of his girlfriend, because the information that we received was that he trawled the dark side of the web visiting, among other things, sites containing, suicide themes and sexual perversions,' the source said. Lubitz was reportedly the subject of gossip about his sexuality after a brief spell working as a flight attendant, and was nicknamed 'Tomato Andy' - a gay slur based on the fact that although many people believe tomatoes to be vegetables, they are actually fruits. Roland Wolff (third left), chief of the criminal division of the Dusseldorf police and head of the special investigative team, talks with colleagues as 100 investigators help to identify the victims of flight 4U 9525. Yesterday, it was revealed by police that Lubitz suffered from a'severe psychosomatic sickness' that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists. Police said they took away a plethora of medicines from his apartment in Dusseldorf and from his parental home in the small Rhineland town of Montabaur. Police have moved to seize the confidential medical records of the mass killer hitherto protected by labyrinthine privacy laws in Germany. They particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside, killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew.

{"article": "It started as a conversation about how to photograph China's famous golden monkeys, and ended with Prince William pledging to dress up as a tree. During his wildlife conservation visit to China, the Duke of Cambridge visited a photographer to learn about how he managed to capture such close up pictures of wildlife. And when\u00a0photography enthusiast Xi Zhinong told the Prince he often dressed up as a tree so he could get close to the animals, the second in line to the throne pledged to do the same. Prince William has pledged to dress up as a tree on his next visit to China so that he can go out with photographer and conservationist\u00a0Xi Zhinong to photograph rare Yunnan Golden Haired monkeys. The Prince said when he next returned to\u00a0Yunnan Xishuangbanna he would join Xi on a photography exhibition and also don the same disguise\u00a0to photograph the endangered Golden Haired Monkeys of Yunnan, according to People's Daily Online. It was pledged during the Prince's tour of the Far East, which he used to foster UK business links as well as raise awareness of the dangers of the illegal trade in wildlife. Golden haired monkeys of Yunnan are native to the forests of China and are highly endangered - with less than 2,000 estimated to be living in the wild. While able to withstand plunging temperatures and even snow, the species is in danger because their habitats are slowly disappearing and their distinctive appearance has made them a key target for illegal hunters. Yunnan golden haired monkeys are native to China but they are believed to be less than 2,000 in the wild. They are also something of a mystery because they were first discovered by scientists in the 1890s, then lost and thought to be extinct until 1962. The monkeys are herbivores and give birth every two or three years. China has launched a conservation programme to try and protect the species. Xi Zhinong is a Chinese wildlife photographer as well as an environmentalist. Between 1992 and 1996 Xi went to Baimaxue Mountain National Nature Reserve to raise awareness of the Golden Haired Monkey. He also hoped that by sharing photos of the monkeys and how they lived he could protect the natural habitat of the animals, in a strip of primeval forest. Prince William spoke to photographer Xi about his work and learned how he disguises himself to take pictures. After being discovered in the 1890s the Yunnan Golden Haired monkey did not appear again until 1962. During his visit, Xi presented Prince William with two photography collections, 'Wild China' and 'The Spirit of Life'. Prince William was in China last week for a wildlife conservation visit. His visit was the highest profile Royal visit since the Queen toured the country in 1986, and gave the Prince the chance to meet wildlife experts and conservationists. He used the tour to condemn the trade in illegal wildlife and products, such as ivory, and called upon China to become a world leader. Golden haired monkeys are in danger because their habitats, mainly forests, are slowly disappearing. Prince William was intrigued by the golden haired monkeys and asked how close-up pictures were possible. Golden haired monkeys are native to China and mainly spend their time in the forest canopy. During his time in the country Prince William visited Beijing and featured on a television campaign organised by WildAid and aimed at raising awareness of the impact of the trade in rhino horn and ivory. The tour ended however with a PR disaster when the Prince was allowed to visit an Elephant rescue centre, just\u00a0a few yards from an arena where elephants play football, dance and do tricks for tourists. Prince William's visit was also seen as an opportunity to create links between the two countries, and he met President Xi Jinping. The end of Prince William's tour was branded somewhat a PR disaster after he visited an elephant sanctuary yards from where the animals perform tricks for audiences in a type of circus, condemned by campaigners.", "abstract": "During his wildlife conservation visit to China, Prince William pledged to dress up as a tree on his next visit to China so that he can go out with photographer and conservationist Xi Zhinong to photograph rare Yunnan Golden Haired monkeys.

{"article": "For those who witnessed Ireland\u2019s approach to playing Scotland at Celtic Park in November at close quarters, suggestions that they are a robust and direct unit scarcely seem tantamount to slander. Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s side may not quite have mirrored the ultra-industrial style favoured by Jack Charlton\u2019s men all those years ago, yet there were precious few morsels of real quality for the game\u2019s purists to feast on. Were Poland then, doing any more than stating the blindingly obvious this week when they spoke extensively of Ireland\u2019s one-dimensional, strong-arm strategy in their qualifying games thus far? Aiden McGeady celebrates scoring for Republic of Ireland against Georgia. You wouldn\u2019t have thought so but, then again, Martin O\u2019Neill, whose Ireland side entertain the Poles in Dublin, has never been one to resist an ever-so diplomatic counter-swipe at such accusations. Clearly keen to gain the slightest psychological edge ahead of what is being viewed as a must win game for the Republic, the former Celtic manager bristled when word of the Poles\u2019 comments was relayed to him at their Malahide base on Friday. \u2018I\u2019m not really bothered about what they say \u2014 genuinely not bothered,\u2019 O\u2019Neill insisted. \u2018I\u2019m not so sure they could glean that from the games we have played. It\u2019s not for me to retort but Poland are as physical a side as I have seen in some time.\u2019 Ouch. Adam Nawalka\u2019s side are a pretty accomplished one, too, however. Currently sitting on top of Group D, Ireland will surely need snookers to catch them if they leave the Aviva Stadium with another maximum return of points. Having won in Georgia and pinched a point in Germany, Ireland\u2019s campaign hit the buffers with defeat in Glasgow in their last competitive outing. In a section with next to no margin for error, O\u2019Neill\u2019s side badly need to begin a sequence of four home games from five with a win. In that regard, a degree of calculated risk taking is in order. Aiden McGeady\u2019s downturn in form has seen him excluded from Roberto Martinez\u2019s Everton side since January 31 but \u2013 while far from ideal - his international manager sees that as no barrier to inclusion. McGeady\u2019s downturn in form at Everton should not affect his Ireland position. \u2018You can get away on a bit of adrenaline if you are reasonably fit and I think he\u2019s been fit for a number of weeks. He just hasn\u2019t played for Everton in that time,\u2019 said O\u2019Neill, who handed the player his Celtic debut 11 years ago. \u2018Adrenaline can carry you a certain distance. You wouldn\u2019t want to be going into a game with say three or four players not having played that much football. \u2018That may happen but you know that as some stage these players are going to tire a bit. But it is what it is. \u2018It\u2019s a disappointment from this side but I\u2019m not in charge of their club commitments. \u2018Listen, it would be absolutely fantastic if players were coming in here on the back of having played games the last couple of weekends. \u2018You always sense it\u2019s never going to be that way. I was involved as a player at Northern Ireland and we had players coming in who hadn\u2019t played much at club level but suddenly they got a lift from playing international football. \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019d be hoping for.\u2019 If O\u2019Neill is bemused by McGeady\u2019s exclusion at club level, he made a fine job of hiding it. \u2018That\u2019s entirely up to Everton,\u2019 he straight-batted. \u2018If I was to make that judgment on every single player at club level, I might be listening to the wrong comments. \u2018Roberto Martinez is absolutely entitled to pick whoever he wants to at club level. \u2018If he doesn\u2019t think that Aiden is playing well enough to be picked for his team, that\u2019s entirely up to him. Republic of Ireland coach Roy Keane shares a joke with McGeady during training session. \u2018We\u2019ve a different aspect here. He is obviously very important for us. He\u2019d a great start against Georgia, continued that on although he may have been a little disappointed (in how he played) against Scotland. \u2018Overall, he is important to us. I think just the change of environment might just give him that lift. I\u2019m hopeful. \u2018He\u2019ll be a bit disappointed that he\u2019s not in the Everton starting side.

But a new hand dryer claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of this potentially deadly bacteria quickly and effectively. Called the Sterillo, it uses a technology known as 'UV plasma' to blitz all the dangerous airborne molecules inside a room. There she blows: A new hand dryer called Sterillo (pictured) claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of potentially deadly germs. It uses a form of UV light to blitz all the bacteria inside a room. The technology is already used in ambulances and care homes to kill infections, but in the form of a hand dryer can tackle unsanitary conditions in bathrooms. The device uses technology discovered in the 1920s, called dual wave UVC light. This is a form of UV light and is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks. The device makes use of two wavelengths to kill the viruses. A lamp in the hand dryer creates a type of oxygen molecule called oxygen radicals. Such molecules are found naturally and are nature\u2019s way of cleaning. Plasma is blasted from the dryer and destroys the germs.

{"article": "England\u2019s fledgling wine industry is threatened by a group of devastating plant diseases discovered in the country for the first time. Experts at the Royal Horticultural Society in recent months have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops. The diseases, spotted on vines at RHS gardens in Wisley, Surrey, and the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale. Kent, have damaged vineyards in wine-growing countries around the world. Outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields, delayed fruit ripening and overly-acidic grapes. The only way to properly deal with the problem is to pull up the plants, experts say. Experts at the Royal Horticultural Society  have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops (file picture) The warning comes after wine producers announced this week that they are to apply for the name \u2018Sussex wine\u2019 to be given protected \u2018designation of origin\u2019 status, putting it in the same league as Champagne and Bordeaux. The reputation of English wine has grown immeasurably in recent years, particularly in warm and sunny Sussex, which has similar soil and climate to the Champagne region of France. Sales of sparking English wine are expected to hit \u00a3100million in 2015, following a boom in the number of vineyards in recent years. In 2014 alone 46 wine producers opened in southern England, a 50 per cent year-on-year increase in new firms. Vines are also becoming a popular plant in back gardens, with many homeowners trailing one over a trellis or up the inside of a conservatory. Dr Gerard Clover, head of plant health at the RHS, said there is no sign the viruses have yet made it into commercial vineyards, but warned producers to be wary of the disease. Writing in the trade journal the Grape Press, due to be published next month, he said: \u2018The discovery of four grapevine viruses not previously reported in the UK during an in initial survey suggests there is no room for complacency. \u2018These viruses have the potential to spread and cause damage to the UK\u2019s developing grapevine industry.\u2019 The four viruses cause different problems to plants, including leafroll disease, stem pitting, and fleck disease. Outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields, delayed fruit ripening and overly-acidic grapes (file picture) They are thought to have come to our shores on imports of infected plants, but can also be spread by mealybugs and scale insects. Dr Clover urged commercial vineyards to be aware of the risk and to only use plants that are certified as being virus-free. Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, he said: \u2018We found four of these viruses in Wisley and one at Brogdale. But we found them because we knew what we were looking for. \u2018The symptoms could easily be mistaken for something else - nutrient deficiencies for example, or other problems. \u2018We visited two commercial sites in Suffolk and Surrey and found no signs of the viruses at either.\u2019 But he said that until now there has been limited monitoring for viruses in British vineyards, so the diseases are likely to be i8n other sites as well. He added: \u2018It is reasonable to suggest that they could have spread further, but it is impossible to say how far. \u2018Luckily we have caught this early so we have opportunity to do something about it.\u2019", "abstract": "Four plant diseases that can destroy grape crops have been discovered in England for the first time, posing a threat to the country's growing wine industry. The diseases, which have damaged vineyards in wine-growing countries around the world, were identified by experts at the Royal Horticultural Society in recent months. The only way to deal with the problem is to pull up the plants, experts say."}

{"article": "Husband-and-wife meth users disarmed a Colorado wildlife officer and a sheriff's deputy then forced them to their knees along a desolate mountain highway before the husband was killed in a struggle, police reports released Thursday show. The man had handcuffed the deputy and held both officers at gunpoint with their own weapons before the wildlife officer overpowered him, took back his gun and shot him to death Monday near the small town of Dinosaur in northwestern Colorado, about 10 miles from the Utah border. Neither officer was injured during the encounter that began after they found the couple's abandoned Ford Explorer on the side of the road. Outlaws: Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges of attempted first degree murder, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery among other charges. Her husband, James Damon, 46, was shot and killed by police. Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges including attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and disarming a peace officer. Her husband, James Damon, 46, died at the scene. The police reports provide new details about the harrowing struggle. After finding the SUV, wildlife officer Nathan Martinez followed a set of footsteps to the couple, who were sitting on a hillside. Damon aimed a handgun at Martinez and ordered him to keep his hands up as Hand pulled the officer's weapon from his holster, the reports state. They forced Martinez to sit down and toss his radio onto the ground. Damon asked if he had a wife and kids, finally saying, ''How do we get out of this, how does everybody walk away alive?'' Hand told investigators, according to the reports. Pointing Martinez's own gun at him, the couple then led him down the hill toward Moffat County Deputy Bhrent Shock. Struggle: A Colorado sheriff's deputy and a state wildlife officer were held hostage by a husband and wife before a struggle erupted and the man was fatally shot. The officers have been suspended. Hand told investigators her husband pointed his gun at Shock's face and ordered him to the ground, where Damon stripped him of his gun, radio and stun gun before handcuffing his right hand to his duty belt. Damon then pressed the gun into the back of the deputy's head. Martinez threw the keys to his vehicle toward Damon and told the pair they could take it and go, according to the reports. Hand walked away and Martinez told investigators that Damon ordered the officers to their knees near the Ford. Martinez could see the deputy's handgun in one of Damon's hands and his own weapon in the other. 'At this point, Officer Martinez knew they were going to die, but he wasn't going to die without a fight,' the police report says. He'made the decision to disarm Damon and get his own handgun back.' Some details of the struggle were hazy. Martinez told investigators he didn't remember at what point the gun fired, but that it malfunctioned before he was finally able to fire a shot into Damon's back. The officers then arrested Hand, who was still holding a handgun. A judge on Wednesday ordered Hand to remain in jail without bond. Court records do not list an attorney who could comment on the allegations against her. Hand told investigators she and Damon had been injecting meth at least once a day throughout the week, according to the reports. The pair were wanted in Wasatch County, Utah, on charges of burglary, theft and forgery, according to court records. They were accused of using a stolen credit card and checks to make thousands of dollars of purchases at a Wal-Mart and elsewhere in December. Authorities in Chaffee County, Colorado, were seeking them on suspicion of stealing credit cards, ski equipment, electronics and other items from cars and pawning them.

{"article": "The widow of a terminally ill man who was conned out of almost half a million pounds by a close friend condemned the fraudster as a 'despicable man'. World-famous lighting architect, Jonathan Speirs, was persuaded to part with a total of \u00a3476,864 by friend and neighbour Keith Cameron through a complicated ruse. Now Jonathan's widow Elizabeth Speirs, 58, has revealed the heartless crime has left the family struggling for cash. She has been forced to sell off her home in Edinburgh which she shared with her husband for 24 years. Heartless: Neighbour Keith Cameron convinced his terminally ill friend\u00a0Jonathan Speirs to part with nearly \u00a3500,000 in a complicated ruse. Cameron, 54, conned Jonathan - who was dying of stomach cancer - out of thousands of pounds by claiming his company, Chase Telecom Ltd, required money to win a valuable contract to supply telecom services. The devious businessman repeatedly claimed the company was trading well and that investors had pumped millions of pounds of money into the business. Cameron, who was a close family friend of the Speirs, insisted Jonathan could expect to receive a return on his investment of around \u00a32 million within two years. But it later emerged the entire operation was a lie and that Cameron, also from Edinburgh, had been using Jonathan's cash to maintain a luxury lifestyle. The father-of-two, who has now been declared bankrupt, was found guilty of fraud at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Wednesday and will be sentenced next month. Jonathan's wife Elizabeth said the cruel scheme had left her and her two daughters, Lucie and Erin, in 'dire straits financially.' Tragic:\u00a0Elizabeth Speirs is being forced to sell the home she shared with her late husband Jonathan (right) after cruel scheme left them broke. Elizabeth, who recently underwent radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer, said:. 'It hasn't quite sunk in - I'm just very grateful that the jury saw through him. 'He's just a despicable man, and what he did to my husband - who was a good man - is just awful, and the financial situation he has left us in is awful. 'I'm going to have to sell my house soon, as I can't afford to stay. 'I never got a chance to grieve for my husband because I found this out right away. I feel like I have been robbed of so much in my life - my husband, a friend, and the chance to build a new life for me and my daughters. 'My husband had withdrawn money from a policy that he had taken out in case either he or his [business] partner became ill, so that he could exit his company without any financial impact. 'The Camerons have been friends with us for a very long time. They were people we trusted.' On Wednesday, the court heard Cameron had a mortgage of \u00a31.34m million, had bought cars for his wife and daughter, took holidays in a luxury villa and sent his two daughters to an Edinburgh private school. One of his daughters also attended the American Academy of Drama and the Arts in New York and had a student flat near the Empire State Building. Victim: The late Jonathan Speirs was duped into paying \u00a3500,000 to Cameron, who spent the money on funding a luxury lifestyle. Cameron had signed off three payments to Jonathan amounting to \u00a375,935, in what were supposedly dividends from the telecoms company but it later turned out to be. Jonathan's own money funnelled back to him. Elizabeth said: 'He [Cameron] did it because he was broke. 'Our money paid for two Minis - one for his wife and one for his daughter. It paid for the school fees for his daughters, and holidays to Portugal and Spain. 'He has been living a lie for many, many years. He hasn't worked since 2009 - since then he has purportedly been setting up a business. He just got used to the good life and he didn't want to give it up. 'But his wife and his daughters are not implicated in this - I want to make that clear. 'It's not something you would have been looking out for. When somebody comes back to you with good states of account and it's a friend who you know has a good track record, you think everything is going to be okay.

{"article": "These pictures of Boris Nemtsov chatting on his mobile phone at a radio station are believed to be the last images of him before he was shot dead in a 'contract hit'. The 55-year-old former deputy prime minister was gunned down on a Moscow bridge on Friday in a 'politically motivated' attack which has sparked outrage and public mourning. The pictures show Mr Nemtsov talking animatedly on his mobile phone ahead of a radio interview to promote an anti-Kremlin rally, just hours before he was killed. Scroll down for video. Mr Nemtsov was seen speaking on his mobile phone at a radio station, just hours before he was killed. The images of Mr Nemtsov at\u00a0Ekho Moskvy radio station are believed to be the last before he was killed. Footage emerged last night showing the killing, with a person jumping into a car and driving off. He can be seen sitting in the studio of\u00a0Ekho Moskvy - the Echo of Moscow - an alternative Russian station which has been criticised by the Kremlin in the past. He had been invited on to the talk show to discuss the latest opposition march he had organised, which was due to go ahead today but will now be used to protest his death. The station has previously been reprimanded by the Russian authorities for accounts of the conflict in Ukraine which were deemed to have contained 'information justifying war crimes'. The images were taken on the day Mr Nemtsov was shot dead after taking his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya to dinner. Dramatic footage of the killing surfaced last night, with Russian media reports claiming the killer emerged on foot after loitering on the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge waiting for Mr Nemtsov. The clip appears to show the killer appear as Mr Nemtsov and Miss Duritskaya walk along the bridge which overlooks St Basil's Cathedral. Mr Nemtsov was seen in the studio of Ekho Moskvy - the Echo of Moscow - an alternative Russian station which has been criticised by the Kremlin in the past. Mr Nemtsov was shot four times on a Moscow bridge after taking his Ukrainian model girlfriend\u00a0Anna Duritskaya to dinner. The alleged attacker is then getting into a passing car, driving off shortly before midnight. Critics have attributed blame for the murder to the Russian President, claiming his government feared that an incriminating report Mr Nemtsov had been working on would be made public. The findings are said to present evidence linking Putin's regime to the Ukrainian crisis which has seen thousands slaughtered. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fingered the Russian leader as the culprit of Mr Nemtsov's death, with mourners at the scene where he was shot also alluding to his murder as having been politically engineered. Opposition supporters will march through Moscow today, passing the spot where the politician was killed. The procession follows yesterday's protests which saw hundreds of mourners lay flowers and hold up signs reading 'we are all Nemtsov' - a reference to the Je Suis Charlie movement following the terrorist attacks in Paris in January. In the days before his death, Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, said he feared being killed by the Russian leader. 'I'm afraid Putin will kill me. I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine. I couldn't dislike him more,' he said in an interview with\u00a0Russia's Sobesednik news website. The white car (pictured) that carried the assassins has reportedly been found by police not far from where the leader was murdered. Footage released on Sunday suggested his shooter may have been on foot and driven away after the killing. The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River. More than 20,000 protesters marched through Moscow in a mass demonstration against the killing of Boris Nemtsov, organisers said. Dozens of protesters with Ukrainian flags also gathered outside the Russian Embassy in London to voice their anger at Mr Nemtsov's death. He also revealed his 86-year-old mother's fears that he was be assassinated because of his outspoken views. '\"When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.\" She was completely serious,' he added. She received a telegram from the Russian president which described her son's murder as 'vile and cynical'. 'We will do everything to ensure that the perpetrators of this vile and cynical crime and those who stand behind them are properly punished,' it said. 'Please accept my deepest condolences in connection with this irreparable loss. I sincerely share your sorrow. 'Boris Nemtsov has left his mark in the history of Russia, in its political and public life. He occupied significant posts in a difficult time of transition in this country. He always openly and honestly voiced and upheld his views.' He has now assumed 'personal control' of the investigation and his spokesman\u00a0Dmitry Peskov said the shooting could be a\u00a0'provocation'", "abstract": "Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister of Russia, was shot dead on a Moscow bridge on Friday in a politically motivated attack.

{"article": "Lord Warner, pictured, has accused the Labour party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care. ED Miliband\u2019s pledge to rein in NHS \u2018privatisation\u2019 by capping profits of firms providing care has come under fierce attack from a former Labour health minister. As Labour made the NHS the central issue of its election campaign launch, Lord Warner accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care. He said competition between different providers was vital to ensure the NHS can cope with spikes in demand, which occur most winters. \u2018It is very difficult for the NHS to cope with the peaks and troughs of demand without the involvement of the private sector,\u2019 he said. Kicking off his campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics in east London, Mr Miliband said the election \u2018may come down to the wire\u2019, though his deputy Harriet Harman insisted Labour was already \u2018within touching distance of victory\u2019. His main policy announcement was that Labour would halt what he called a \u2018tide of privatisation\u2019 in the NHS. Firms brought in to provide free treatment to patients would be hit with a five per cent profit cap, he said. Labour said the cap would apply to all NHS contracts worth \u00a3500,000 or more. Any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the NHS for any returns above the level of the cap. Local NHS commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances, if approved by NHS England or the Health Secretary. The cap would not apply to GPs, pharmacies or dentists. Mr Miliband repeated his pledge to introduce a \u2018mansion tax\u2019 on expensive homes, impose a levy on the tobacco companies and close tax loopholes exploited by hedge funds. The \u00a32.5 billion raised would pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more doctors, 5,000 new care workers, and 3,000 more midwives, he said. Claiming another five years of Conservative government would mean \u2018the disintegration of our public services\u2019, Mr Miliband added: \u2018We\u2019ll scrap David Cameron\u2019s market framework for the NHS and stop the tide of privatisation. \u2018The NHS will be the preferred provider. No company working with the NHS will be able to profit by cherry picking: rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs for their own advantage.\u2018And, for the first time, we will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our National Health Service. \u2018The standard rule will be a five per cent cap. Because the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care, not for excess profits for private firms.\u2019 Miliband kicked off his campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics in east London. Critics accuse party of hypocrisy, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when Labour was in power. Overall, around just six pence in every pound is spent in the NHS with the private sector, compared to just under five pence under Labour. Labour insists that the Government\u2019s NHS reforms have accelerated the number private firms winning NHS contracts, with around one in three now going outside the health service. Lord Warner, a health minister between 2003 and 2007, pointed out Labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the NHS \u2013 and insisted it could not now survive without them. Of Mr Miliband\u2019s profit cap, he told the Daily Mail: \u2018It runs the risk of being one of these pre-election promises which doesn\u2019t stand up when confronted with the reality of government. \u2018It\u2019s far from clear how you would actually implement it. A lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the NHS at standards NHS tariffs. Is that a profit? Miliband's main policy announcement was that Labour would halt what he called a \u2018tide of privatisation\u2019 in the NHS (file picture) \u2018If you want to scare people, you can scare people. But all the work that was done in the Blair government on choice and competition showed that people didn\u2019t have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector. \u2018What they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe.' The Labour peer said some senior people in his party appeared overly \u2018preoccupied\u2019 with the issue of private sector involvement in the NHS, insisting: \u2018It rather misses the point. \u2018The point is what\u2019s the best quality of care we can provide for patients at a reasonable price.\u2019 Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \u2018If you bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time \u2013 then you\u2019ll put our NHS at risk. We can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy, but Ed Miliband doesn\u2019t have an economic plan. \u2018We all", "abstract": "Former Labour health minister Lord Warner has accused the party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care by pledging to cap profits of firms providing care.

{"article": "The Greek government has proposed hiring tourists to help uncover tax dodging businesses in holiday resorts as part of its efforts to rescue the country\u2019s shattered finances. Holidaymakers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called \u2018onlookers\u2019 carrying hidden cameras and recorders to catch tax dodgers. The plan, which met with immediate mockery from critics, emerged in a leaked letter sent by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis to the President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem, which outlines a range of reforms for the Greek economy. Revelation: The unusual plan\u00a0emerged in a leaked letter sent by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (above) to the President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem. In the letter Essex-University educated Varoufakis said: \u2018The culture of tax avoidance runs deep within Greek society.\u2019 Arguing that tax authorities were overstretched, he suggests hiring \u2018large numbers of non-professional inspectors\u2019 to spread fear among tax-avoiders. The plan would involve basic training for the amateur tax sleuths who would be \u2018wired for sound and video.\u2019 The inspectors, who would operate across the country with tourists most suitable for spying on resort areas, would not be able to confront tax dodgers or have any authority to carry out checks but the evidence they collected could be used in prosecutions. The inspectors would be hired for a maximum of two months and would not be re-hired. Varoufakis, finance minister of the new left-wing Syriza government in Greece, claims the move would create a new climate in the country. Secret filming: Holiday makers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called \u2018onlookers\u2019 carrying hidden cameras. \u2018The very news that thousands of casual \u2018onlookers\u2019 are everywhere, bearing audio and video recording equipment on behalf of the tax authorities, has the capacity to shift attitudes very quickly spreading a sense of justice across society and engendering a new tax compliance culture,\u2019 Varoufakis writes in his letter. The idea however has met with derision from some quarters with one unnamed European official quoted as saying the plan was \u2018hilarious\u2019. The letter is the Greek Government\u2019s detailed response to a request from its European partners to provide a list of reforms for its economy, a promise agreed by Varoufakis last month in return for an extension of its current bail-out pending further talks. The tax spy proposal is one of seven reforms proposed by Varoufakis, which will be considered by Eurozone finance ministers on Monday. Other measures include taxing gambling, improving existing budget and tax collecting systems and creating a Fiscal Council which would act as an independent overseer of state spending.

{"article": "Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on Earth. They have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Meteorite impacts, like the one in the illustration above, may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight. Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Professor John Sutherland, a chemist at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge who led the study said: 'Although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes, the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools, according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme. 'The various products would be synthesized by subtle variations in the flow-chemistry history of the streams and the order in which they merged or ran into pools. 'Although the overall scheme would not involve all the steps of the reaction network taking place simultaneously in \u2018one pot\u2019, the various products would end up mixed together in pools.' Scientists have long believed that the building blocks for life first began occurring one after another although the debate for which came first has been controversial. Meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create RNA, lipids and amino acids. The researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life. First the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water (a) and then reacts with metals to create salts (b). These are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating (c). The resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further (d). The researchers behind the latest study, which is published in the journal Nature Chemistry, found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for RNA and DNA - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and UVlight. They also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells. The conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same, meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life's basic building blocks simultaneously. Professor Sutherland and his colleagues argue that the early Earth would have been a favourable setting for these reactions. Hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells, according to new research. One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance", "abstract": "Chemists have discovered that life on Earth may have been initiated by a series of chemical reactions caused by two simple but poisonous compounds that were abundant on our planet four billion years ago.

But Laidlaw insists those brutal home truths need to be told if the Scots are to improve. The Gloucester half-back said: 'Vern is an honest bloke - he doesn't miss when he swings. 'He's been honest but he's been good too. He's a clever coach and the boys appreciate that. 'The boys don't mind being told. We watched the game back and they saw themselves some of the flaws and that makes us frustrated. 'It really was the simple things we did well against England which allowed us to get on the front foot and take the lead. 'But we let them off the hook in the second half. We almost thought, 'Brilliant, we are in the lead, we have a chance'. We relaxed a couple of per cent and let England come back at us. That cost us the game.' The last time Ireland were welcomed into Edinburgh they were mugged 12-8 by Scott Johnson's side and Laidlaw believes the current Dark Blues could learn from that 2013 display. He said: 'Looking back to that game we just did little things well to stay in the game. 'That will be the key again this weekend. We need to get into their half, hold the ball, win penalties then get the scoreboard ticking over. Get three points, six points, maybe then a try. 'Once you start playing in their half, the game becomes so much easier.' Scotland players look dejected following their 25-13 loss to England at Twickenham last Saturday.", "abstract": "Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw has admitted that the team will be embarrassed if they do not end this year's RBS 6 Nations with a victory on Saturday against Ireland. Scotland have not done enough to beat France, Wales, Italy or England, and they will have to produce a stunning result to spare themselves their third whitewash in 11 years. Laidlaw hopes his men can at least stride away from the tournament with some pride intact and avoid the prospect of stumbling towards this year's World Cup with heads bowed."}

The Southeast Asian country\u2019s tourism board released the short film, titled \u2018Love en Route\u2019, which tries to tell a cute love story involving a lovesick American tourist who tracks down a young Thai woman through her Instagram photos. But the clumsy 16-minute video, released along with a five-minute trailer, has been criticised and received negative reviews from those within the travel industry. Tourism Thailand's short film features a lovesick American man (left) who follows a young Thai woman. The video tells the story of a US tourist who takes a solo trip to Thailand 'to heal a broken heart' Produced by Thailand\u2019s tourism ministry and the National Federations of Thai Film Associations, the video is intended as a love letter to the country\u2019s sights, sounds and culture while encouraging visitors to share their photos with their social media friends.

{"article": "John Kerry tried to defuse the ongoing row over Benjamin Netanyahu's forthcoming speech to Congress - despite fears it will affect negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program. The Secretary of State said he did not want the Israeli's Prime Minister's forthcoming address to a joint session of Congress to become'some great political football'. Netanyahu's speech, organized by John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, was set up without the blessing of the Obama administration - and comes as the White House tries to strike a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Scroll down for video. Play ball: Secretary of State John Kerry, right, tried to stop a feud over Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu (left) escalating in an interview Sunday. On his way: Netanyahu is pictured above with his wife Sarah, leaving Tel Aviv for the address to Congress on Tuesday. It is feared that such a public show of closeness to Israel, a firm foe of Iran, could dash Obama's hopes in the negotiations, in which he hopes to curb the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. Kerry played up U.S.-Israeli unity in an interview on Sunday for ABC's This Week\u00a0show, insisting 'the prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. 'And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history.' There is, however, a clear different in policy between Netanyahu and the White House - with the Israeli leader expected to urge Congress to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime. Congress wants to keep the sanctions regime strong, but the President has said he would veto any new penalties to preserve the negotiations. Kerry reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying the White House deserved 'the benefit of the doubt' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached. By accepting an invitation from the Republican party to. address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the. Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech. before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol. Solemn: Netanyahu has claimed his visit is above the political, and says he is standing up for all Jews by visiting Washington. He is pictured above praying at Jerusalem's Western Wall. But both sides have tried to downplay the rift. In remarks on Saturday at Jersualem's Western Wall,. Netanyahu said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to say. that I respect U.S. President Barack Obama.' He added that he. believed in the strong bilateral ties and said, 'that strength. will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and. those yet to come.' Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on. Sunday. The Israeli prime minister, who is running for. re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being. above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for. all Jews. 'I'm going to Washington on a fateful, even historic,. mission,' he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv. 'I feel. that I am an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who. do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,' he told. reporters. Not popular: Anti-Israeli demonstrator are pictured above protesting in D.C. ahead of Netanyahu's address. Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to. approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama's pledge to. veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks. U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran. diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate. election stunt that will play well with voters back home. While White House and Israeli officials insist that key. areas of cooperation, from counter-terrorism to intelligence to. cyber security, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran. talks has shaped up as the worst in decades. Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate. between the Republican and Democratic camps. The planned. address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu's. government and some congressional Democrats. Some two dozen or. more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial. estimates. Iran itself has weighed in on the speech as well. Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister. Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of trying to undermine. the nuclear talks in order to distract from the Palestinians' unresolved bid for an independent state. 'Netanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution,' Zarif said. Meanwhile a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,. said the 'politicized' nature of his visit threatened 'what. undergirds the strength of the relationship'. As one former U.S. official put it: 'Sure, when Netanyahu. calls the White House, Obama will answer. But how fast will he. be about responding (to a crisis)?'", "abstract": "John Kerry has attempted to calm the situation surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress, which is feared to affect negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program.

{"article": "An endless, steep road spirals up ahead of me and in the heat of the Ibiza sun it seems insurmountable... until a somewhat over-enthusiastic Spencer Matthews sprints straight past me. Yes, it seems the secret to his rock-hard abs and enviable tan is impossible runs up the mountains of the White Isle, where he is doing anything but partying into the wee small hours. I have signed up to No1 Bootcamp, the retreat tucked into a beautiful sprawling farmhouse near the coastal town of Santa Eulalia. The before and after shots showed the difference the Ibiza camp made to Spencer's figure. It is famed as the bootcamp to the stars (alumni include \u00a0X-Factor contestants, model Calum Best and former Atomic Kitten Natasha Hamilton). And as if to prove a point, the indomitable Made in Chelsea stalwart turns up unannounced on my first day. We're a nervous bunch at 7am as we stand in our lycra waiting to meet Andy Morris - a former personal training instructor in the RAF. We had all arrived at different times the day before, dropped off at this picture-perfect villa Casona Morna, where its fragrant gardens give way to a beautiful pool and an outdoor seating area makes the perfect spot for al fresco lunch and dinner. Casona Morna is located near the pretty Ibiza town of Santa Eulalia, not far from the beach. Relaxation time is spent on loungers around the pool in the villa's pretty gardens. Just down the road is the beach - where Andy hosts classes when he feels we need a change of scene - and all around are rolling hills criss-crossed by hiking routes which we explore in the afternoons. A bundle of energy with the essential booming voice that every instructor needs, Andy has us all weighed, measured and taking part in a basic series of exercises as an introductory fitness test before we have even had breakfast. When we do eventually sit down my serving of porridge looks decidedly small as he talks us through the week - 7am intensive workouts for 20 minutes, three-hour hikes, swimming pool-based activities, boxing classes, team games and endurance work-outs on the beach are just some of the highlights. Spencer works out during a boxing circuit with former RAF personal training instructor Andy Morris. Fellow Made in Chelsea star Binky Felstead lost a stone by taking part in No1 Boot Camp in Ibiza. And we'll be doing all this while on a severely calorie-controlled diet. Our amazing chef and nutritionist Kate will be serving up three meals a day and snacks, but it will all be sugar, gluten and dairy-free. My stomach rumbles in sympathy. As it turns out, the food is delicious. For the first 48 hours I feel hungry and have a slight headache - all part of the detox process apparently - but soon enough I start feeling fulfilled by the meals and we certainly have a great mix of foods, from hamburgers and 'chips' (sweet potato) to fish, salad, stuffed peppers and frittata. MailOnline writer Sarah Gordon poses with Spencer Matthews in the sunny gardens at Casona Morna. There are 13 of us in my group and we create a whole spectrum of shapes and sizes. Of the four men, Spencer is at the fitter end of the scale, while others admit they work long hours and don't have the chance to work out. Among us females we have everything from a professional stunt woman looking to hone her shape, to a slim girl who just wants to get fitter and an overweight woman who is keen to kick-start her weight-loss. The rest of us could just do with losing a few pounds. Thankfully, the variety means we're not pitted against each other. Andy is quick to tell us we are only competing with ourselves. Some of us excel during the running and endurance training, others are great when it comes to weights. I learn an entirely new workout vocabulary. It's all about maintaining form (basically, making sure you do the exercises properly and don't do yourself a mischief). We interchange High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT - where you blast through exercises with 100 per cent, but it's all over quite quickly) with isometric training (strength training focusing on one muscle or group of muscles). Despite the somewhat alien terminology, we're all soon using the jargon and Andy takes care to explain exactly what each class is doing for our bodies and why it is perfectly balanced with the previous exercise circuit. Don't be fooled though, he's not all friendly and cuddly - don't let him catch you slacking off. When Andy decides the group needs a change of scene, he moves the workouts to the nearby beach. Porridge with figs, a healthy burger and sweet potato chips and a stuffed pepper keep us full of energy. Bircher muesli, a refreshing salad and a delicious Thai prawn curry are also", "abstract": "No1 Bootcamp in Ibiza is a fitness retreat that offers a severely calorie-controlled diet and a range of exercises, including 7am intensive workouts, three-hour hikes, swimming pool-based activities, boxing classes, team games, and endurance work-outs on the beach.

{"article": "(CNN)The march toward publication of another book by the reclusive \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" author continues forward. Many people who know her have raised questions about 88-year-old Harper Lee's ability to consent to publish another book, while others have said she knows what she's doing, according to a New York Times report. Alabama officials have found Lee wants to publish the book. Since Lee wrote \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" in 1960, she had steadfastly refused to publish another book. Lee now lives in an assisted living facility in Monroeville, Alabama, and some friends say her forgetfulness makes her unable to knowingly consent to publishing the book, \"Go Set a Watchman.\" After receiving an anonymous complaint of elder abuse about Lee, the state of Alabama sent investigators from the Alabama Securities Commission to talk to her and others around her. \"It was clear to our investigators that she fully understood the questions that were being asked, that she indicated she certainly wanted her book published, and she had her opinions that were voiced during the interview,\" Joseph Borg, the agency's director, told CNN. \"And at that point we decided that she certainly knew what was going on.\" Lee wrote \"Go Set a Watchman\" before \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" and it features some of the same characters. Lee lawyer Tonja B. Carter found the \"Go Set a Watchman\" draft in the author's belongings in August and negotiated a publishing deal with HarperCollins. For now, \"Go Set a Watchman\" is still scheduled to be released by HarperCollins in July. The Securities Commission investigation is closed. \"Should something come up a later date that shows something was wrong, which we have no indication of, we could take another look,\" Borg said. \"But since we had no complaint from the person who in the middle of it all, so there was no reason to maintain the case open.\"", "abstract": "Alabama officials have found that Harper Lee, the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" wants to publish her new book \"Go Set a Watchman.\" There have been concerns raised about Lee's ability to consent to publishing the book due to her forgetfulness, but investigators found that she fully understood the questions being asked and indicated that she wanted her book published.

{"article": "The average intelligence of the human race has been steadily increasing, scientists have claimed. In research looking back over IQ tests from the past few decades, they found that the tests were becoming harder - but people were still doing just as well. But the reasons why people are becoming smarter is not known - with theories including better education and improved medical care. Researchers at Kings College London looked at scores over 64 years. In total, more than 200,000 participants in IQ tests were studied. Since 1950, average intelligence was found to have risen by about 20 IQ points. Explanations include better education (stock image shown) and improved medical care. The research, titled A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of Raven's Progressive Matrices and reported by William Kremer for the BBC, was published in the journal intelligence. Carried out by Peera Wongupparaj, Veena Kumari and Robin Morris from Kings College London, they looked specifically at the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (RPM). Poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two, a separate study in December 2014 found - and its impact increases as the child ages. Deprived young children were found to have IQ scores six points lower, on average, than children from wealthier families. And the gap got wider throughout childhood, with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence. Scientists from Goldsmiths, University of London compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the Twins Early Development Study (Teds). The study is an on-going investigation socio-economic and genetic links to intelligence. This tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence. In total, more than 200,000 participants from 48 countries over 64 years were studied in the research. Since 1950, it was found that the average intelligence had risen by the equivalent of 20 IQ points. 'RPM is a valid and reliable measure of general IQ, Dr Wongupparaj told MailOnline. 'Also, it is cultural-free test so that it has been widely used for nearly 80 years.' \u2018IQ tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always 100, so this is a significant jump,\u2019 the BBC reported. The research builds on earlier evidence from philosopher and psychologist James Flynn, from the University of Otaga in New Zealand. He had noticed that IQ tests were getting harder, but people were still getting similar scores on them - which became known as the Flynn Effect. This graph shows how the\u00a0Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (RPM) scores have been increasing over time. RPM is seen as an accurate way of measuring intelligence, and 'it is cultural-free test so that has been widely used for nearly 80 years,' Dr\u00a0Wongupparaj told MailOnline. The research was carried out by scientists from Kings College London. They looked specifically at the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (RPM) - an example is shown.\u00a0This tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence. Apparently, if modern Americans took a test from a century ago, they would get a relatively high average IQ score of 130; vice versa, and our ancestors would score a measly average of 70. This equates to a three-point rise in IQ per decade. According to the new study, though, outside of the US the biggest change was clearly in developing countries, IQ was \u2018catching up with the developed world\u2019. \u2018There are multiple possible reasons proposed for this phenomenon,\u2019 they write. These include improved education, increased exposure to testing, improved medical care and nutritition and decreased family size. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that the instance of IQ increasing was not just true in general for the world as a whole - but could also be noticed on a much smaller scale. \u2018The Flynn effect is strong enough to be showed in even small and non-representative samples as well as in the very young and older adults,\u2019 the researchers conclude.", "abstract": "Research from Kings College London has found that the average intelligence of the human race has been steadily increasing, with average intelligence found to have risen by about 20 IQ points since 1950.

{"article": "It is the moment mother Emily Caines feared she would never experience \u2013 the \u2018lion\u2019s roar\u2019 of her baby\u2019s vital first cry. After she had lost two babies because they were born prematurely, doctors went to extraordinary lengths to ensure baby Lennox would survive. One year earlier, she had delivered her tiny daughter Adelaide at 24 weeks, a baby who tragically lived for just one hour. Despite her overwhelming grief, Mrs Caines allowed a photograph showing Adelaide struggling for life to be published, because she felt so strongly that abortions should not be carried out on babies of a similar age. Other babies born so prematurely have survived, which she believed made \u2018a mockery\u2019 of the law allowing abortions until the start of the 24th week of pregnancy. Before 24 weeks, they are not legally considered \u2018viable\u2019 \u2013 despite recent advances in neonatal care. The tragedy: This was the image that broke our hearts... of baby girl Adelaide who died at 24 weeks. The triumph: This is baby boy Lennox, born to the same mother... who lived at 32 weeks. Doctors had told Mrs Caines that, due to physiological reasons, any child she conceived was unlikely to survive. Her cervix was so short that it would be a miracle if her womb could hold on to the baby long enough \u2013 meaning it would probably die after another extremely premature birth. But now Mrs Caines, 26, has realised her \u2018impossible\u2019 dream of becoming a mother, giving birth to Lennox at 32 weeks last December, with her husband Alastair beside her. Lennox\u2019s birth came not only after the heartache of losing Adelaide, but also their first baby Isabelle, who was born at 23 weeks in 2011. But thanks to medics at Southmead Hospital in Bristol, the result this time has been triumph instead of tragedy. Describing the moment Lennox erupted into life, Mrs Caines said: \u2018Isabelle never cried and Adelaide\u2019s cry was very weak but Lennox\u2019s was like a lion\u2019s roar. \u2018We just burst into tears because we finally believed he really was going to be OK. It was amazing.\u2019 Thriving: Young Lennox with mother Emily Caines, who now feels 'totally blessed' She said: \u2018There were so many times when I thought, \u201cI\u2019m never going to be a mum, ever. It\u2019s not meant to be.\u201d \u2018After Isabelle and Adelaide, we asked ourselves, \u201cAre we going to put ourselves through this again? Are we going to put ourselves through potentially another loss?\u201d \u2018But we just had to give it another go. I just couldn\u2019t give up.\u2019 Mrs Caines and Alastair, a 29-year-old security guard, subsequently started IVF in March and she was implanted with the embryo in April. Hero: Professor Tim Draycott holds tiny Lennox shortly after his birth. Crucially, her obstetrician Professor Tim Draycott used medical techniques designed to \u2018trick\u2019 her body into avoiding an early labour. At 12 weeks, he put in a cervical stitch to give her womb more support. And at 14 weeks, he started giving her extra doses of progesterone. Explaining why he administered extra progesterone, he said: \u2018Progesterone is hugely higher in pregnancy than at other times. This helps to keep the uterus muscle quiet and probably helps reduce inflammation too, so there\u2019s nothing driving it to contract before it should. \u2018But we think some women don\u2019t have enough progesterone in pregnancy, so the uterine muscle sparks off. We know that if we give this medication, it reduces the chance of early labour by about 50 per cent.\u2019 Other precautions included prescribing aspirin to help maintain a healthy placenta, as doctors believe a breakdown triggered her miscarriage of Isabelle, and regular screening. And in a highly unusual move, Mrs Caines also spent over a month in hospital when she reached 23 weeks, so medical staff could do everything possible to stop the baby arriving early. Nurses scanned her every 48 hours to monitor the baby and \u2013 crucially \u2013 measure if her cervix was shortening. If it was, that drastically increased the risk of contractions starting. Thankfully, she did not go into labour \u2013 and a week after being discharged, she enjoyed a baby shower party with friends at home in Yeovil, Somerset. She said: \u2018It was a huge milestone because I\u2019d lost both my daughters before my baby showers.\u2019 But soon afterwards, her waters began to leak, raising the risk that Lennox could contract a potentially fatal infection. As a result, Prof Draycott and colleagues decided it would be safer to get the baby out rather than continue to 36 weeks, which had been the target delivery date.

'There are gay men and gay women who participate in intercollegiate sports.' UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship.

Christie's son Louie, 26, said that his father had been unwell for a while but was only recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Louie, who is also a boxer, said: 'It is a real shock because my dad has always been fit and has never smoked or drunk \u2013 it seems so unfair. 'Being who he is, he didn\u2019t want to make a fuss when he felt unwell. He thought it would clear up. 'It was a real shock when he got the results back. We were both stunned. But he is \u00adremaining positive and has vowed to beat it. He is determined to get well. I\u2019m very proud of how he is coping.' Christie, pictured during his memorable bout with Mark Kaylor (right) in 1985, has started chemotherapy. Explosive: Christie (right) and Kaylor got up close and personal while promoting their clash in 1985. Christie was training amateur boxers, including X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, at Gym Box in London until last week but has been forced to put that on hold to focus on fighting his illness. Christie's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father's diagnosis. During his boxing career, the former champion fought 41 bouts, taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout. He suffered eight defeats, most memorably to Mark Kaylor in 1985. The infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference, and when the boxing finally got underway Christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored. Although he boxed on into the early 90s, he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993. Christie's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated Mow Gruciano in what was then East Germany to take the European middleweight belt. The father-of-one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer Lloyd Honeyghan last October during a Boxing Writer's Club dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London. Frank Bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up, but no punches were thrown. Christie said at the time: 'There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don't know what planet he was on but it's different from the rest of us. No punches were thrown. He was just mouthing off, acting the big shot.'", "abstract": "Former European middleweight boxing champion Errol Christie has revealed he is battling lung cancer and has started chemotherapy.

The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was actually advertising sanitary towels, according to The People's Daily Online. Photographs of the beautifully decorated carriages were shared widely on social media and the PR stunt, which coincided with International Women's Day, won praise from commuters. PR stunt:\u00a0The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was part of an advertising campaign. Rainforest: One of the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line has been made to look like a rainforest with green designs on the floor, walls and ceiling. Psychedelic: Each of the carriages contained different images, ranging from traditional blossom trees to more psychedelic designs. Tao Chin, a spokesman for the underground line, said: 'We wanted to make the experience of travelling on carriages more enjoyable, and so the 3D effect covering various subjects was introduced with a good reaction from our customers. 'We make sure that the decorations cover not just the walls but also the windows, doors and roofs to maximise the effect.' There were five different themes used, including\u00a0an amusement park, European castles and a fairy tale world. Passenger Sying Tsao told local media: 'I didn't see them advertising things and then suddenly when I turned up for work one morning I saw that the carriages had this great new 3D designs. 'They were very realistic, I saw one child nervous about stepping on a 3D floor. 'I have seen three or four different designs, I like the cherry blossom best because I haven't seen any so far this year, and it was really nice and calming, not just for me but for everyone on the tube I think.' Mr Li, manager at the care products company's head office, said using 3D adverts in the carriages not only promoted their products, it also encouraged the 'heads-down generation' to look up and enjoy the scenes around them. But while the colourful designs were appreciated by commuters, most had not realised the carriages were actually advertising sanitary towels.

The details will be discussed at the coffee chain's annual meeting Wednesday. In Seattle, the company said it will team up with a company called Postmates to deliver to homes and offices within specific areas. Coming soon:\u00a0Starbucks says it will start delivering to customers in select parts of Seattle and New York City later this year. Postmates said on its website Wednesday 'With such incredible traction on their leading mobile payment app, Starbucks delivery by Postmates is an extension of what customers are looking for today, and provides a type of convenience that was never before available.' The company's CEO, Bastian Lehmann, told Re/code 'Speed is the number one thing. We\u2019re actually working with Starbucks on trying to figure out what the best delivery containers are. 'Is there a packaging that we can develop together? Is there a cup that\u2019s a better to-go cup?' In New York City, delivery will be from existing or newly setup Starbucks shops in certain buildings, starting with the Empire State Building. On Wednesday, Starbucks said in a news\u00a0release that the service is called \u00a0the 'Green Apron' delivery choice. Starbucks Chief Digital Officer Adam Brotman told the Associated Press there will be no minimum purchase required, but that deliveries will require 'a small flat fee.' He declined to say what the exact fee will be. Delivery workers will accept tips, too. Brotman said the average time for deliveries will be 30 minutes, starting from when the order is placed. Speaking about the two programs, he told Re/code 'The truth is we\u2019re not sure exactly how it will play out. Is one the national approach and one for dense urban environments only? We are truly in learning mode right now but we\u2019re excited about them both.' For New York City, people will be able use a website to place orders. In Seattle, people would place orders via the company's mobile app. The hours of operation for delivery are still being determined. In the meantime, Starbucks Corp. also says it's on track for a national rollout of mobile order-and-pay, which lets customers place orders through its apps ahead of time so that drinks and food are ready when they arrive at the store. The program was launched in Portland, Oregon, late last year. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw says the company expects to see a lift in sales as a result of mobile order-and-pay by late this year. Mobile order-and-pay will launch in Canada this year as well, and be tested in the United Kingdom, according to the company.

{"article": "What's for dinner?\u00a0How about leftover cartilage of skate with herring-head tartar sauce, cured tuna blood line aioli or a meat loaf of offal and slightly past-its-prime cow usually reserved for dogs? Those and two dozen other dishes using scraps and usually ignored bits comprise the menu at chef Dan Barber's WastEDny, a pop-up project at one of his Blue Hill restaurants in New York intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste. The farm-to-table guru, a multiple James Beard Award winner and author of The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food didn't have a hard sell on his hands when he invited 20 of his heavy hitter chef friends to join him in turning out $15 a la carte plates made from day-old bread, bruised beets, brine from the olive bin and the peels of pineapples. Among the chefs backing the concept are Mario Batali, Dominique Ansel and Alain Ducasse, with each taking it in turn to take the lead. Grub's up: In this Thursday, March 19, 2015 photo, a waiter serves a couple at WastED in New York - the menu includes dishes using scraps and other ignored bits. Diners haven't been put off by the idea of 'dumpster dining' and there is currently a waitlist for WastEDny. The final sitting will take place on March 31 and there is no word if a repeat session will occur. Even Barber's tabletops and cocktails tell the story. The restaurateur had his Manhattan tables redone with tops from agricultural byproducts and mushroom mycelium for his two-and-a-half week pop-up. His boilermaker libation included flat beer syrup and spent coffee grounds with the bourbon. Using such waste, of course, has been part of rustic cuisines around the world for centuries. And chefs like Barber, who has a second restaurant on a farm north of the city, are far more efficient than they're given credit for. But in the U.S., the land of abundant fast food, grocery aisles piled with perfect produce and home refrigerators stuffed with food never eaten, the distribution system has been deemed broken by activists in a waste movement more firmly taking root. 'Really, the larger issue is how do we create a culture of eating that utilizes the entirety of the food system. 'To do that we need chefs and restaurants to start the conversation,' Barber said during a recent busy night of service at WastEDny, capitalized to emphasis his hope of educating the unenlightened. Fine-dining restaurants are just a fraction in the food waste equation, however. About 40per cent of food grown for human consumption in the U.S. is tossed, cramming landfills, and about a third of such food globally never makes it into human mouths. Dinner is server: Fried skate wing cartilage with smoked whitefish head tartar sauce. Novel idea: Chef (above) Dan Barber's WastEDny, a pop-up project at one of his Blue Hill restaurants in New York, is intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste. With nearly one billion people starving or food insecure around the world, much of the waste is generated by U.S. households and farms themselves, said Jonathan Bloom, an activist in Durham, North Carolina, and author of American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half of Its Food (and What We Can Do About It). 'It's a system that is not serving anyone particularly well,' Bloom said, noting that waste is scattered throughout the distribution chain. 'We have an obesity crisis on a global scale in addition to a hunger crisis, the scale of which we've never seen before, and at the same time we're overproducing, taxing our planet to an unnecessary and dangerous amount.' Barber sees his pop-up as an extension of his 'third plate' philosophy that challenges Americans to radically rethink what is acceptable and unacceptable to eat while becoming better stewards of the land. 'In America we come with this blessed landscape, this Garden of Eden... with incredible soils, temperate climate, predictable rainfall, and we produce a ton of food. 'And because of that we were never forced into the kind of negotiations that suck up waste,' he said. That goes a long way in explaining the 'wasted special' served up by one of Barber's guest chefs, Bill Telepan of the Upper West Side restaurant Telepan. He fashioned his plate of tuna on a bed of salvaged radish greens, incorporating them into a pesto, slicing the radish into the dish and using the usually tossed blood line of the fish in an aioli. Chefs are trained to carve out the blood line and tuna overall is a good example of customer preference driving waste, he said. 'People look for that certain ruby red part of the tuna. They're not interested in paying top dollar for a piece on the side that may not look as beautiful", "abstract": "Chef Dan Barber's pop-up project, WastEDny, is serving up dishes made from food scraps and usually ignored bits to shed light on the issue of food waste.

{"article": "Washington (CNN)It doesn't matter how many times Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the Palestinians. The White House is refusing to take him at his word. \"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,\" President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday. These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election. Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory. White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to say whether Netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would \"reassess\" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Administration officials have said the United States is now considering signing on to a U.N. resolution which supports a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls \"in droves\" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of \"rhetoric\" was \"contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly.\" Obama added: \"If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country.\" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month. While the speaker's office says the trip was planned well before the Prime Minister's re-election, it will come around the deadline for an initial nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers.", "abstract": "President Obama has stated that the White House is refusing to take Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his word regarding his support for a two-state solution with Palestine.

With the Prince of Wales for the visit was Camilla who looked wonderful in a pale gold coat and who looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. Chief Petty Officer Patricia Kirchner, who manages the alley, told that Charles, as he walked over to the lanes, said: 'I've got a couple of bowling balls picked out, just try one.' With the Duchess of Cornwall at his side Charles, who had turned down the offer of some bowling shoes, confessed 'I haven't done this for a long time'. But he gingerly picked up a bowling ball and sent it down the fifth lane more in hope than expectation. And its off! Charles releases the ball and waits to find out how he's done. Not good enough! Charles managed to knock down four pins but didn't seem pleased with the result. His execution looked good but the bowl ran wide and clipped three pins that toppled over and he turned to Camilla and said: 'At least I got one'. Bill Bowen, an 80-year-old retired staff sergeant from the US Air Force, said: 'He did pretty good,' adding, 'I told him I was the worst bowler in this alley and he said \"no, I am\".' The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property. Looking around: The royal couple are shown the veterans' art room. Having a chat: Charles and Camilla appeared to be enjoying their tour and chatted to veterans. Hello there: Charles bends down to a veteran using one of the machines in the gym. Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George. Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents. Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there. Enjoying himself: Charles, seen here chatting to veterans, has received a rapturous reception in the US. Having a look: Charles and Camilla pose outside President Abraham Lincoln's Washington D.C cottage. On their way: The royal couple leave Lincoln's Cottage en route to their second engagement.

{"article": "Jordan Wills works as a paintball target, with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range. When student Jordan Wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets, fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph. The 19-year-old from London works as a human bullet impact tester, or more simply a paintball target, and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave. He beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the \u00a316,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies. 'I guess I have a high pain tolerance - but it's really not as painful as people think,' said the Kingston University Computer Graphics student. 'The hardest part is the anticipation when you know it's coming. 'The most times I'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two.' And while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing, Mr Wills does his job in just a t-shirt. He is a fan of the game anyway, and has previously played a lot in his spare time. He works 16 hours a week at different UK Paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of \u00a340,000, which works out at a wage of around \u00a316,000 a year. Mr Wills, who stays in shape as a rower, said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job. He added: 'When people find out what I do they think I'm crazy - but I love my job. 'The initial pain lasts for about five seconds, then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it's gone. I don't even remember I've been shot.' The teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to. The paintballs are fired at Jordan's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph. Rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs, Mr Wills must stand still while players take aim at him. He reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard.  Anything that draws blood, leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable. Mr Wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball.

{"article": "He has been embroiled in a well-documented feud with Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana after the former called\u00a0babies born through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) \u00a0'synthetic'. But Sir Elton John - whose two sons Zachary, four, and Elijah, two, were conceived with the help of a surrogate and artificial insemination - appeared to offer an olive branch when he declared his love for the fashion duo in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. Speaking on stage at his concert at the Colosseum, Elton included the pair in a list of inspirational people who have changed the world, such as Nelson Mandela and Lady Diana, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video. 'I love Dolce & Gabbana!' Elton John (pictured on March 11) spoke from the stage on Wednesday night where he declared his love for D&G despite a recent feud. Famous fans! Elton's show was watched by newly single Bradley Cooper, Miles Tellar, Jonah Hill and British comedian Jimmy Carr on Wednesday. While his praise for the designers was greeted with laughter by the audience, Elton went on to add: 'Listen, the band have been wearing Dolce & Gabbana, I love Dolce & Gabbana clothes.' Sir Elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised IVF, saying: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' Elton, who is married to David Furnish, responded furiously, writing on Sunday: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as \"synthetic\". Controversy: Designer Domenico Dolce (right) has defended his controversial remarks and said he'respects all the world'. He is pictured with business partner Stefano Gabbana (left) 'And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF \u2013 a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.' His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand. Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments. Equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has organised a protest outside D&G's London store on Thurday to show the public's opposition to the inflammatory comments. Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is close friends with Sir Elton, offered her support with the message: 'Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.' OMD&G! Elton was seen carrying a Dolce & Gabbana bag only days after launching a feud against the brand. But the designers hit back - Stefano Gabbana told an Italian newspaper: 'It's useless, this is just an authoritarian way of seeing things: if you agree with me, good, otherwise I'll attack. And I wrote to him, in the comments on Instagram: fascist.' Things took a twist when Elton was seen\u00a0carrying a D&G-branded bag only 24 hours after he entered into a high-profile row with the designers over their criticism of fertility treatments. Caught red handed: The star clearly didn't seem too oposed to the fashion house even though he encouraged others to boycott. Photographers said Sir Elton was seen carrying the Dolce & Gabbana bag on March 16, after being dropped off in his chauffeur-driven SUV. A spokesman for the singer confirmed: \u2018Yes he was carrying the bag but he hadn\u2019t been shopping. And it should not detract from their original message or the boycott.\u2019 Elton's comments on-stage in Las Vegas came after\u00a0Dolce insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.' Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.' He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved.

Five years after Alexander McQueen's death his secret two-bedroom East Sussex hideaway has been put on the market with a guide price of \u00a3695,000. From the outside the modest stone built granary appears a world away from the bright lights of the catwalk and the influential designer's flamboyant public image. But nestled down an unmade road, the centuries old property was a refuge for the star, whose private life was blighted by battles with depression, drink and drugs. McQueen hanged himself at his main home in London's Mayfair after taking a mix of cocaine, tranquillisers and sleeping pills, in February 2010. Five years after Alexander McQueen died his secret two-bedroom hideaway in Fairlight, East Sussex, has been put on the market. Through the key hole: The open plan interior was designed by the late fashion star who in private battled with depression, drink and drugs. The sale of the designer's sanctuary comes as a retrospective collection of McQueen's work has gone on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.The show features pieces taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last. The Old Granary, situated between Hastings and Rye, is being sold by Phillips & Stubbs estate agents for a guide price of \u00a3695,000. Throughout the interior of the contemporary open plan detached home the stylish influences of the celebrated designer can be seen. The stunning home, within walking distance of Fairlight beach, features an impressive open plan living room with limestone tiled flooring. Both the kitchen and dining room are fitted with bespoke units and the bathroom fixtures were imported from Italy. Upstairs the main bedroom has plenty of wardrobe space where the designer would have been able to store some of his collection. The East Sussex property was a sanctuary for the trouble star away from the bright lights of the glamourous fashion world. Both of the bedrooms have scenic sea views and on a clear night the glittering lights of France can be viewed. The garden also contains a one-bedroom detached guest annexe  where the designers host of celebrity friends, including the likes of Kate Moss, could stay. The property is being sold with planning permission for an extension. The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world McQueen came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter. Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans.

Above, one travellers' camp in the town last year. In total, the areas covered by the ban account for a third of the land in Harlow, according to a spokesman for the council. Gipsies have been moved from illegal encampments in the town - which is just 25 miles from Dale Farm, formerly the site Europe's largest traveller camp - on 109 occasions since October 2013. The temporary injunction will mean anyone illegally camping in Harlow could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court. It will remain in place until a full hearing later this year. The order was served to travellers who were part of an unauthorised camp at Horsecroft Place this morning. The group has since moved on from the site, a spokesman at Harlow Council said. Injunction papers will also be  displayed on the 454 parcels of land over the coming days. The ban applies to 35 named travellers, all of whom have now left the town, and will also protect land from encampments by 'persons unknown'. Two legal traveller sites in the town, with a total of 44 plots, which will be unaffected by the ruling. Harlow Council said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country, it believed no ban covering an entire town had ever been applied for and granted. 'Blighted': Gipsies have been moved from illegal campsites in the town on 109 separate occasions since October 2013. Above, police attend one illegal site that was set up on a cycle path in the town last year. 'Unprecedented':\u00a0Harlow Council said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country, it believed no ban on this scale had ever been applied for and granted. Above, an illegal site pictured last year. Last year, Leeds City Council successfully applied for an injunction protecting six 'environmentally sensitive' areas of land in the city. And it was reported in September that Coventry City Council was seeking a 'blanket' injunction covering the whole city. The ruling by Mrs Justice Patterson at the High Court yesterday was welcomed by\u00a0Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, who described it as a'major step forward in ridding the town of this blight.' Harlow Council leader, Jon Clempner, said: 'The town has had enough and we needed to resolve this situation with a long term solution to protect land now and in the future. 'An injunction, which covers a piece of land here and there was never going to work, so we had to look at a something which has never been done before and is town-wide. 'Months and months of detailed preparation backed up with a catalogue of community concerns meant we had a very strong case that could be put forward to the judge. 'It is not - and never has been - about persecuting any particular group of people or their way of life. 'This situation has really tested the patience of the whole community and we need to end this cat-and-mouse game which is being played. 'Seeking a High Court injunction of this size and scale takes time and requires a huge amount of preparation to get it right especially when it has never been done anywhere before.' Nearby: Harlow is just 25 miles from Dale Farm, pictured, formerly Europe's largest traveller camp. Evicted: Violence erupted when gipsies were removed from the illegal site in Basildon, Essex in October 2011. But the decision has been slammed by traveller leaders. A spokesman for the Gypsy Council said: 'Unauthorised encampments are a reaction to lack of provision by local authorities. 'What's to stop the government from applying for an injunction for the whole country and managing to totally wipe out a way of life?' Harlow stands less than 25 miles from Europe's former largest illegal traveller site, Dale Farm, in Basildon, Essex. Basildon Borough Council spent more than \u00a37 million of taxpayers' money on a controversial eviction of the site in October 2011 following a 10-year legal battle.", "abstract": "Harlow Council and Essex County Council have been granted an interim injunction by the High Court banning gipsies from setting up illegal campsites across the entire town.

Nic Taylor, 32, a photographer from St Helens, Merseyside, filmed Lucas's reaction as Gemma rips off strips of sellotape while wrapping Mother's Day gifts. Five-month-old Lucas is relaxed until he hears the loud noise of his mother unwrapping a roll of sellotape.

{"article": "(CNN)A runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport reopened Friday morning, a day after a Delta Air Lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of Flushing Bay. Runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar. It reopened at 10:30 a.m. ET Friday, according to Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Delta plane slid off the runway Thursday morning, with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters. Delta Flight 1086 briefly circled New York due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday, passenger Jared Faellaci told CNN. Almost as soon as it did, those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft's wheels seemed to have little to no traction, sliding for about 20 seconds. \"You didn't feel the wheels take,\" Faellaci said. Then it was a matter of \"where we are going to end up,\" he said. About 4,500 to 5,000 feet down Runway 13, the MD-88 veered to the left and mercifully stopped on a small embankment. A little farther, and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in Flushing Bay rather than on the airport's snow-covered ground. Contrary to what Delta said in a statement, the aircraft's slides did not deploy, according to Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. Still, with help from first responders, everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to LaGuardia's Delta terminal. Video showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area. Twenty-four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening. Three of those were transported to nearby hospitals, the New York City Fire Department tweeted. Faellaci said he was thankful for the plane's crew, first responders and God that it wasn't much worse. \"It was cause for a moment of prayer and a moment of reflection, as people were scared,\" he said. \"The pilot did a phenomenal job.\" The plane left a relatively balmy Atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later. Before touching down, the plane's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay. Still, little prepared passengers for what happened. Faellaci said he was reminded of the U.S. Airways plane that landed in the Hudson River in 2009. All 155 people aboard that flight -- heading from LaGuardia to Charlotte, North Carolina -- famously survived thanks to the skills of pilot Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger. The landing of Delta Flight 1086 was terrifying for many. \"There were people that were calm, there were people that were praying, there were people that obviously were frantic, there were people that were crying,\" Faellaci said. Jihad Lateef, another passenger, was traveling with his brother. \"When the plane landed it was like me falling off of the top bunk -- didn't really know what was going on -- I just felt a hit, boom,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"I just prayed.\" The Port Authority chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before Flight 1086 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported \"good braking\" action on Runway 13. Still, that doesn't mean the pilot did anything wrong. \"I think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down,\" Foye said. \"Obviously, the pilot and the co-pilot's efforts were reflected in the fact there were only minor injuries.\" After the plane stopped, emotions ratcheted down some but not entirely. Faellaci said there was some \"panic and shoving your way to the front\" to get off, though \"for the most part it was very orderly.\" Passengers spent a few minutes standing in the snow -- carrying little more than their wallets and phones -- before buses took them into the warmth and comfort of the terminal. Four minutes after the plane landed, all of LaGuardia Airport shut down to air traffic. One of its two runways -- the one not involved in the incident -- reopened a few hours later. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.", "abstract": "A runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport has reopened after a Delta Air Lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of Flushing Bay.

{"article": "(CNN)By the time Cynthia Falardeau read about Alex Pring, a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer, she had made peace with her son Wyatt's limb difference. Her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands. At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was. Wyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months. \"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport. In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary. So when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive. \"He doesn't need this,\" she thought. Her fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\" There were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had. Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable, an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free. The UCF team, which operates a nonprofit called Limbitless Solutions, is special because it's the only group in the 3-D volunteer network making electronic arms. Most 3-D arms are mechanical, which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep. \"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt. The UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free. \"My mother taught us that we're supposed to help change the world,\" Manero said at the time. \"We're supposed to help make it better.\" The students were blown away by what happened after that. The \"Today Show\" and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero, and then they got international attention. Families in more than 25 countries have asked the UCF students to help their children. In February, Microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world. Each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations. Petresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics. \"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\" Eventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.", "abstract": "A team of students and graduates from the University of Central Florida have created a battery-powered robotic arm for children using a 3D printer.

{"article": "The Homeland Security Department is investigating two senior Secret Service agents accused of crashing a car into a White House security barrier. Mark Connolly, the second-in-command on President Barack Obama's security detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor in the Washington field office, reportedly drove a government car into the barricades after drinking at a late-night retirement party last week. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said recently appointed Director Joseph Clancy has been briefed on the March 4 incident and that Clancy has asked the Homeland Security Department's Inspector General's Office to investigate the incident. Officers on duty who witnessed the incident reportedly tried to arrest the agents and conduct a sobriety test, but a\u00a0supervisor said to let the men go home. President Obama is aware of the incident and the investigation. Scroll down for video. An investigation has been launched to see if two Secret Service agents, including Mark Connolly (above), the second-in-command on President Obama's security detail, drove their car into a White House barricade. This after the men had reportedly been drinking at a late-night retirement party for Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan (above) The agency said the two agents have been reassigned to non-supervisory, non-operational jobs. The Washington Post\u00a0reports that the men had been at a bar to celebrate the retirement of departing Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. Connolly and Ogilvie have declined to comment, though it is believed that the incident was likely caught on\u00a0Secret Service video, which feeds to the agency's command center. According to witnesses, the two men had their flashing lights on and were showing their badges as they tried to get through a section of the grounds that had been closed as a suspicious package was being investigated at around 10:30pm. It was then that they struck the barricade, after also driving through some security tape. It is illegal to use the flashing lights on a government vehicle without a security reason, or to drive a vehicle after consuming any alcohol. In 2013 a civilian who crashed into a barricade at the White House was chased by police and shot and killed. 'The Secret Service is aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees at the White House complex,' said Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary, a spokesman for the Secret Service. 'If misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations.' Also commenting on the situation were House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and member Elijah Cummings of Maryland who said in a statement; 'The fact that this event involved senior-level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation. 'The Committee as a whole remains committed to restoring the integrity of this elite agency and improving accountability at all staff levels.' The crash investigation is the latest embarrassment for the agency tasked with protecting the president. In the last six months, several top agency officials, including former Director Julian Pierson, have been forced out amid revelations of multiple, serious presidential security breaches. In September, a Texas man armed with a knife was able to climb a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being apprehended. An internal investigation and an outside panel report both described serious problems within the agency. A four-member panel of former senior government officials concluded in a report released last year that the agency was too insular and starving for leadership. The panel recommended an agency outsider to replace Pierson, but Obama earlier this year tapped Clancy, a retired agent who led the agency on an interim basis after Pierson's ouster. January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn.

The discovery was made by Jonathan Revett and the mushroom has now been classified as a new species in the world. Fun guys: A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a busy road. They have been named as geastrum britannicum to reflect them being unique to the UK. Mr Revett, 49, said: 'They do look like little mushroom men. 'It's really strange how their shape makes them look like they have a head and arms.\u00a0That's what drew my attention to them.'

The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs. However, 15 years later, mycologists in Spain carried out DNA sequence analysis and have just confirmed they differ slightly. Mr Revett - who runs the mycology website fenfungi.com - said: 'It felt brilliant knowing I'd found something new. 'I wouldn't normally question the experts but I just knew these were different.

Earlier, his promoter Bob Arum had made it clear that Pacquiao had issued a $5m challenge to Mayweather with regard to the testing, and offered to surrender that amount should he fail the examination. In addition to the giving blood, Pacquiao also gave a urine sample during the test. Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather can expected to be randomly tested before the bout on May 2 in Las Vegas. Arum explained: \u2018Manny proposed that if either of them did not pass a test, that man should pay the other $5m. \u2018Floyd\u2019s team declined. Not because anybody here is afraid of the outcome but because they realised they could legally get a lot more if it happened. \u2018Fine with Manny. If Floyd fails we will be looking for much more compensation than $5m.' Pacquiao has already been paid damages \u2013 reportedly in seven figures \u2013 after taking legal action for remarks made by members of the Mayweather team, when they began demanding drugs-testing, which inferred that he might have used performance enhancing drugs in the past. Under the US procedures, which comply with the World Anti-Doping Agency standards applied for the Olympics, both boxers must submit to random testing in the weeks leading up to the fight and to another immediately after the event. Pacquiao was happy to be filmed by a camera crew from the Philippines, who are documenting the build up. Pacquiao proposed that if either boxer failed a drug test they would have to pay the other $5million. Pacquiao has had to overcome an element of paranoia that a loss of blood prior to fights might weaken him in the ring. But he is so cool about testing now that he allowed video-taping of Sunday\u2019s test by a Philippines camera crew which is filming virtually his every move between now and fight night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Mayweather has campaigned vociferously in the last two years for the implementation of random blood testing for all fights. However, with a split purse of up to $180m for Mayweather and $120m for Pacquiao at stake, it seems inconceivable that either man would even remotely risk detection. Pacquiao has been documenting his training, seen here going fr a road run on the streets of LA. Mayweather hits the speed bag as his training camp continues in his Las Vegas gym. Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time. VIDEO Mayweather and Pacquiao camps exchange verbal blows. Not all boxers make hundreds of millions of dollars for risking their lives in the ring. Compared with the most lucrative pickings ever which await Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2, our own Michael Watson was on a modest stipend when he climbed through the ropes to fight Chris Eubank. That London evening in 1991 ended with Watson suffering crippling brain damage. It is nothing short of a miracle, made possible by rapid and brilliant medical intervention, that Watson has survived to celebrate his 50th birthday, let alone along the way complete a London Marathon in six days with the ever-supportive Eubank for company. Michael Watson (centre), pictured fighting Chris Eubank in 1991, turned 50 on Sunday. The bout left Watson with crippling brain damage and there will be a fund-raining dinner to celebrate his 50th. To celebrate Watson\u2019s half-century, which he turned on Sunday, a fund-raising dinner will be held in London next month to help pay for the constant care he needs.

{"article": "A plus-size blogger who once suffered from an eating disorder has revealed why she feels she is prettiest at her heaviest weight and \u2013 and why she proudly calls herself fat \u2013 as she strips down to her underwear while on camera for a new body image campaign. Marie Southard Ospina, from Brooklyn, New York,\u00a0sheds her clothing as a part of\u00a0StyleLikeU's video series,\u00a0The What's Underneath Project, in which a select group of individuals were asked to remove their\u00a0clothes in order to help prove that style is really about knowing who you are and being comfortable in your own skin. 'I try to use the word fat a lot in my writing,' the 23-year-old says in her\u00a0video. 'I use it to describe myself quite a lot, and I think people's initial reaction is, \"You're not fat. You're beautiful.\" That in itself is problematic because that just implies that you can't be fat and beautiful.' Scroll down for video. Great cause: Marie Southard Ospina shed her clothes as part of StyleLikeU's new body image video series titled The What's Underneath Project. She adds: 'It's a characteristic. It's not this horrendous thing.' When the clip opens, Marie is fully dressed and sitting on a stool in front of a brick wall. She first removes her hat and throws it on the ground before she begins to describe her past struggles with body image. 'For a long time my style was just about kind of concealing by body and for maybe until my early twenties it was just about hiding any kind of excess fat,' she says. Marie explains that she now likes to 'counter a lot of the rules' that plus-size women are told to follow, particularly when it comes to fashion, which means she favors tight-fitting dresses and skirts, as well as bold prints and other things 'that aren't necessarily designed to make you more invisible'. She adds that people have been 'taught that fat is an inherently bad thing', so when they see a larger woman in clothes that show off her body, they are opposed to it. Throughout the video, Marie removes her layers of clothing one piece at a time. She recalls being relatively thin as a child, but says she started gaining weight when she was about nine-years-old. She remembers being bullied in elementary school and describes how her family members would make comments about how she needed to start doing sports. Marie notes that, because she takes after her father, who is 6'2 and heavy set, her Colombian mother and her relatives didn't understand how her bone structure was different. While their idea of beauty is large breasts and thick thighs \u2013 they don\u2019t understand women who are classed as \u2018fat\u2019. Lots of layers: The 23-year-old blogger was fully dressed at the start of the clip. Newfound confidence: Marie removes her clothes as she explains that she once had an eating disorder and struggled with body acceptance. 'If I was going to be curvy, I was going to be fat and as soon I started dropping weight I just became a rail and my curves were gone,' she says. 'They didn't like that either.' Marie says that she believed food was the problem, so she just eradicated it from her life. People didn't realize she had developed an eating disorder at first, and they would often make comments about how her body finally matched the prettiness of her face. 'I think that's the cycle with eating disorders in general,' she says. 'I think you start to get used to the praise, and so you just want to do it more and more. You want to lose more weight. You want to hear that you are doing something good.' Two years into her eating disorder, her mom realized something was wrong. Marie was quickly told to start working with a nutritionist and was also sent to see a therapist. She says she gained a lot of weight back in her later years of high school and when she started college she was a size 14 - but she still wasn't eating healthy. It wasn't until she set off to spend a year studying abroad in Madrid and Prague that she started to accept her body. 'People just didn't seem to look at my size,' she says of the people she met in Spain. 'People when they talk to you they actually talk to you and they're not secretly thinking this girl's a** is so big or she needs to lose some weight.' Marie adds: 'It was more like people actually made the effort to get to know me.' Nothing to hide: Marie even removes her make-up in the video after she notes that she feels her prettiest when she is 'fresh-faced' Final pieces: After removing her socks and pantyhose, Marie is left sitting in a lace bra and underwear. It was there that she met her partner, who she is still with to this day.

{"article": "Twitter has ruthlessly mocked Starbucks campaign for the company's new anti-racism campaign in which baristas talk to customers about race issues while serving their coffee. One user tweeted, 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train', while another pointed out, 'y'all realize there are no coloured hands in the press photos right'. A third speculated,'maybe Starbucks actually wanted to get people of all races & ethnicities to join hands and make fun'. Scroll down for video. Campaign: Starbucks boss Howard Schultz has instructed staff to write 'RaceTogether' on cups in an effort to draw customers into a discussion about the state of race relations in America. Talking point: Although Starbucks says that nobody will be forced into a discussion, baristas are attempting to speak to customers about racism in America by writing slogans on their coffee cups. But Twitter has branded the campaign 'cringe-inducing' and 'patronizing' Humiliation:\u00a0Corey duBrowa, Starbucks' Senior Vice President of Global Communications was forced to delete his account due to 'a cascade of negativity' Corey duBrowa, the company's Senior Vice President of Global Communications, was forced to delete his Twitter account, before re-activating it the next day. 'Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity,' he said in\u00a0a post on Medium. 'I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted'. Staff at the 4,700 caf\u00e9s across America now have the option to write 'RaceTogether' on cardboard cups, which is the slogan of a Starbucks anti-racism campaign. It was hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup would be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting America, in an attempt to 'create a more empathetic and inclusive society - one conversation at a time'. But many customers found the campaign 'patronizing'. '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life \"white man's burden\" crisis,' one user tweeted. Another took a sarcastic approach, tweeting a picture of a white barista, with the message: 'Here's your macchiato! Let's discuss the historic disenfranchisement of your people that has allowed me to prosper.' The campaign was the brainchild of Howard Schultz, 61, the company's boss, who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics, from gay marriage to gun control. His decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, in Staten Island, New York. Last year, Schultz travelled to Starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension, including Los Angeles, St Louis, Chicago, New York, Oakland and Seattle. Mr Schulz met about 2,000 Starbucks staff on the tour, and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address. 'It's an emotional issue,' he said. 'But it is so vitally important to the country.' Last week, the company ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and USA Today, highlighting race tensions in the country. The page was black, with the words'shall we overcome?' in the centre, and the company logo at the bottom. The campaign will continue on Friday, when every copy of USA Today will carry an insert about racism, which will also be stocked at branches of Starbucks. Schultz kicked off the campaign last December with a letter that appeared in TIME magazine. 'Last week, one thing became clear: we cannot continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation, and not acknowledge them, together, as a company,' he wrote. 'Indeed, despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues, we at Starbucks should be willing to talk about them.' Schultz has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart. In 2013, he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores, even in states where they can be carried legally. 'We believe guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience,' he said. He also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year, and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the U.S. by selling bracelets in its caf\u00e9s in 2011. Starbucks is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years. It is not known whether Starbucks is considering pulling the RaceTogether campaign. Traditionally, those who oppose Schultz' views get short shrift: in 2013, when an investor said that the company's open support for gay marriage was harming sales, Schultz responded by suggesting that he sell his shares.", "abstract": "Starbucks' new anti-racism campaign, which involves baristas writing \"RaceTogether\" on cups to encourage customers to discuss race relations in America, has been widely mocked on Twitter.

{"article": "Samantha Cameron and her two older children, Nancy, 11, and Elwen, 9, were in the gallery just beside me for PMQs \u2013 and they chose a belter. 'There's going to be quite a lot of shouting,' I heard Mrs Cameron warn the youngsters as the House assembled below us. There sure was. This was the last PMQs of the Parliament. For either Dave or Ed, this was possibly the last hurrah at the despatch box. As the Prime Minister took his seat he looked up and spotted his children. An enormous beam lit his face and he winked at them. But as he read his usual opening spiel about having 'further such meetings today' he shot the Speaker a rueful little smile, plainly acknowledging that the precious formula of words \u2013 used by premiers for decades \u2013 might never again fall from his lips. Scroll down for video. Mr Miliband was left flustered after Mr Cameron was happy to rule out a VAT increase during the PMQs. After that momentary wobble, Mr Cameron proceeded to do to Ed Miliband what your average food processor will do to a bunch of browning bananas. Magimix time! Mr Miliband had seemed sure he had the zinger par excellence with which to undo his great rival. The Labour leader stood at the Table, feet planted wide, a superior twitch on his lips as he leaned into the microphone. After a drollery about Mr Cameron's'retirement plans' (that TV interview which has so excited the PM's more crosspatch critics), Ed Mil' challenged the PM to give a straight answer to a straight question. 'Will he now rule out a rise in VAT?' asked Mr Miliband. Mr Cameron: 'Yes.' Oops! That wasn't meant to happen. Mr Miliband had been expecting the PM to give a waffling non-answer. All his poise had been predicated on that. The eyebrow had been raised in a doubting manner as he put the query. His tone had been sarcastic. He knew \u2013 just knew \u2013 that Cameron would not be able to give a straight answer. Instead, the low swine had coughed up a horribly direct, undeniable, comprehensible 'yes'. What a filthy trick. Not fair, ref! The Miliband team had spent hours finessing follow-up attack lines. They had envisaged accusing the Tories of failing to be clear about their VAT plans. Now the so-and-so Cameron had gone and ruled out any such rise. Darn Tories. You can't rely on them to do ANYTHING. From my perch I could not see Mr Miliband's eyes but a colleague who was watching him reports that they revolved like a couple of fruit-machine dials whose lever had just been given a mighty yank. His cheeks were sucked in, as were the curtains in Dorothy's bedroom as the tornado strikes in The Wizard of Oz. The whole House was taken by similar surprise. There was an initial silence, as perhaps happens immediately after a bomb blast before car alarms start to ring. Had one of Labour's main themes for the general election just been obliterated? It did look horribly like that. Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase. Er,er, er, er: the Miliband mainframe went into catastrophic systems freeze. He sounded as though he had just swallowed a Rubik's Cube whole. 'Let me say to him, let me say to him, let me say to him,' he jibbered, gulping for air. Then, with desperation: 'Nobody's gonna believe him! Nobody's gonna believe him!' This drew laughter from the Government benches, aghast silence from Labour. Lucy Powell, Labour election supremo, was sitting beside Mr Miliband. She was doing one of those tombstone grins they do in the Tom & Jerry cartoons before all the teeth drop out. Mr Cameron capitalised on the ambush (which, one hears, may have been arranged with George Osborne). He pounced on Labour confusion and asked Mr Miliband if he would reciprocate by ruling out a Labour tax rise on national insurance. Naughty. After all, PMS is meant to be about questions TO the prime minister, not from him. Speaker Bercow let it pass and Mr Miliband flailed. He offered no such promise on national insurance, allowing Mr Cameron to clinch the moment by accusing Labour of a 'jobs tax bombshell'. Only later in the afternoon did a somewhat panicked Labour high command deny that it will hike national insurance tax. By then the moment had largely passed. Mr Cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the Despatch Box, with\u00a0wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen looking on from the public gallery.

{"article": "An Italian policeman has gone on trial in Padua on allegations he lured young women to his home, including a teenage Australian girl, through a couch-surfing website and then drugged and sexually abused them. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year prison term for Dino Maglio. An Australian girl, 16, says she was abused by Maglio, 25, while she stayed at his house. Boris Dubini, who represents the teenager, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense given the tranquiliser he gave her turned her into a 'rag doll' and she couldn't resist. Maglio is being held in a military prison and was not present for Tuesday's hearing. The policeman is accused of using the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice the girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister, prosecutors say. It has been claimed that Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured) used the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice a girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister. The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age and could be sentenced to seven years prison if convicted. Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' He had admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age. But since the allegations were made, more than a dozen women have come forward claiming they were assaulted by the same man, after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO), which carried out a year-long investigation, said that 14 testimonies collected revealed a man who seemed like a fun and fast-living host. Some claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason'. He told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year jail term. More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy. In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself. She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.'

In 2013, Purvi Patel showed up at a hospital emergency room suffering from severe vaginal bleeding.  According to court documents, at first she denied that she had been pregnant but later told doctors that she had a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn fetus which, she said, she placed in a bag in a dumpster. Patel was later charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent, though these charges are decidedly contradictory.  \"Feticide\" would require Patel to have terminated a pregnancy while the fetus was still in the womb.  On the other hand, \"felony neglect of a dependent\" requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it. As Amanda Marcotte of Slate pointed out in February, Patel \"was convicted both of killing a baby and killing a fetus.\"  The only thing more preposterous than this is that Patel was charged in the first place. The evidence against her has been shaky from the start.  Initially, police questioned Patel when she was still in the hospital without an attorney present.  Prosecutors would later introduce text messages indicating that Patel had purchased miscarriage-inducing drugs, but there was no evidence Patel took the drugs.  In fact, they didn't show up in blood tests just after she miscarried. Nonetheless, after five hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Patel of two entirely contradictory crimes based on entirely circumstantial  evidence.  And on March 30, 2015, she was given a 30-year-sentence on the felony neglect charge, 10 of which were suspended. She'll serve a concurrent six-year sentence for feticide. Patel is the second pregnant woman to be charged under Indiana's anti-choice \"feticide\" law.  In 2011, Bei Bei Shuai was charged with feticide after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant.  In 2013, lawyers announced Shuai had reached a plea agreement just before her trial was set to begin. Still, both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government.  But Indiana's harsh anti-abortion laws, and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies, make women far less likely to reach out for this help. Conservatives like to say that women are the \"victims of abortion\" and that laws such as the Indiana \"feticide\" measure are intended to \"protect\" them.  Years ago, the president of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists.  The website of the Ohio Right to Life association similarly argues that \"no one is interested in sending women to jail.\" And in fact, the Indiana \"feticide\" law was plainly intended to criminalize \"knowing or intentional termination of another's pregnancy.\"  But there's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals.  So much for not sending women to jail. Those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned.  After all, Patel was convicted based on text messages about miscarriage-inducing drugs, not evidence she had used or even purchased such drugs. In Shuai's case, it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with feticide.  So what else might be considered a \"deliberate attempt\" to terminate one's own pregnancy?  If a woman knew about the risks of too vigorous exercise and miscarriage but exercised anyway?  Merely googling abortion-inducing drugs?  Telling a friend you've thought about having an abortion? The message from Purvi Patel's conviction is clear. After all, there have always been and will always be women who try to terminate their pregnancies.  Laws like Indiana's and cases like Patel's don't change that.  What they do is make women hide, avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk. In Texas, which last year enacted some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the nation and shuttered the majority of its abortion services clinics, abortion rates have indeed declined but not in proportion to the severity of such measures.  Researchers suggest that's partly because rates of self-abortion, which then go unreported in the statistics, are increasing.  And anecdotal evidence suggests this is the case. Before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. New anti-choice restrictions and prosecutions won't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies.  It simply restricts their options to do so. Ask yourself: In the case of Purvi Patel, even if she did intend to self-abort and", "abstract": "Purvi Patel has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after being charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent.

Streep spoke at the New York City premiere of India's Daughter, a BBC program which tells the story of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old medical student who was set upon by six rapists as she rode a bus in 2012. Singh was injured so badly after the repeated, violent rapes that she later died in hospital. Indian ministers secured a court order banning the documentary in India, for fear it could stoke public anger. Scroll down for video. Tribute: Meryl Streep, center, spoke at a candlelit vigil before India's Daughter received its U.S. premiere. Streep told a packed auditorium at Baruch College in Gramercy, Manhattan, that Singh is not only India's daughter, but 'our daughter, too'. She was joined by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, Dakota Fanning and Indian actress Frieda Pinto.\u00a0The documentary was directed by British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, herself a rape victim. The hour-long film, which has aired in Britain already, sparked uproar for including comments from one of Singh's rapists. Mukesh Singh told film crews: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes.

The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. Protests: Thousands of Indians took to the streets after Singh's death in protest at her brutal violation. Outrageous: Mukesh Singh, one of Jyoti Singh's six rapists, told film crews that the rape was her fault. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. However, Mukesh Singh argued that Jyoti Singh's death was her fault for struggling. He said: 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after 'doing her', and only hit [her friend] the boy.' Grief-stricken: Pictured are Badrinath Singh and his wife, Asha Devi, the parents of Jyoti Singh. Badrinath said the documentary shows the 'bitter truth' about Indian culture. He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two... A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night.' A defense lawyer for the six rapists also weighed in. AP Singh said that if his daughter or sister 'engaged in pre-marital activities... in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight'.

Ljalic had the chance to cancel out Josip Ilicic's first-half opener with a penalty on the hour mark but saw his effort saved by Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto. The away goal for Roma could be vital as the second-place Serie A side look to take the initiative in the return leg at the Stadio Olimpico next week. Seydou Keita runs over to team-mate Gervinho to celebrate his equalising goal for Roma against Fiorentina.

The hosts started stronger, and it was no surprise when Mohamed Salah fashioned the chance for the opening goal after 17 minutes. Salah has been a revelation since arriving in Serie A on loan from Chelsea, with six goals in seven appearances, and he continued his good run of form by playing Ilicic in for the opener. With Fiorentina on the counter-attack, Salah picked up the ball on the left flank - slightly unfamiliar for him - and drove forward at pace. No challenges came in and the Egyptian had the simple task of slipping the ball between two defenders to the feet of Ilicic, who took a touch to compose himself before smashing a left-footed drive past Lukasz Skorupski at his near post. Roma came more into it as the half went on and missed good opportunities through Juan Manuel Iturbe and Alessandro Florenzi but they did also lose both captain Daniel de Rossi and Kostas Manolas to injury. Radja Nainggolan also picked up a booking meaning he will miss the second leg in the Italian capital. After the break the two sides edged back into their shells a little in fear of giving away more of an advantage, but the game burst back into life on the hour mark.

Ljalic stepped up and hit the penalty hard and low but Neto dived low to his right to palm it away. Brazilian goalkeeper Neto brought down Juan Manuel Iturbe to give away a penalty on the hour mark. But Neto swept himself down, got back between the sticks and brilliantly saved Adem Ljalic's penalty. But Roma were not to be denied for too long.

{"article": "(CNN)If you think \"my teen would never sext,\" you might be mistaken. And if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high-risk behaviors, like drinking, using drugs or skipping school, keep reading. Studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit. More than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sent sexually suggestive texts when they were teenagers, according to the study by Drexel University, which was published last year by the Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy. Nearly 30% said they included photos in their sexts, and an astonishing 61% did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners, use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control. Sexting may be the new \"normal' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior, the study concluded. \"There are now a few pieces of research, which are sort of converging on the same finding, namely that this is not a rare behavior,\" said Elizabeth Englander, a professor of psychology at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center. \"I'm not saying that it's healthy or that it's harmless, but it's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self-esteem are doing it,\" said Englander, who researched sexting, as well as a host of other teenager behaviors, for her recent book \"Bullying and Cyberbullying.\" \"It appears to be widespread. It's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it's not very unusual or rare.\" You're probably thinking: \"I check my kids' phones. No sexting happening in this household.\" But there are plenty of apps teens can use to send messages their parents can't find later. Snapchat, Cyber Dust, VaporChat and others allow users to send messages that disappear on both the sender and recipient's phones after a certain period of time. These apps are used by kids and adults alike to send a variety of messages -- from perfectly harmless to potentially dangerous. Brutally Honest: Is it OK to spy on your kids? Diana Graber, who teaches \"cyber civics\" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, was blown away by the response she got from eighth graders when she, for the first time, included a session on sexting. When she asked her students if they knew what a sext was, everyone in the class said they did, but what they didn't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be, including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states. \"They had no idea what the consequences were,\" said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. \"I mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids, so it occurred to me that no one's ever bothered to tell these kids they couldn't do that.\" Graber said she experienced another first that day. A few students wanted to hang around after the class, which is held at the end of the school day, to talk more about sexting and related things. \"That's never happened to me before with this class... and I realized that I had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives.\" She now plans to make it part of her \"cyber civics\" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting. It should be part of sex education, she said. \"We know that throwing the book at them, it's too much too late, so that's not working,\" said Graber, who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships. \"It's very normal teenage behavior... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem, and just have these very easy to have discussions.\" Englander, the psychology professor and researcher, says in her experience, it's not that adults aren't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public. The problem, she says, is kids don't hear the warnings because the reality doesn't fit them. In a online article, she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield.

North Yorkshire Police arrested the married 59-year-old yesterday in connection with Miss Lawrence's disappearance in 2009. He remains in custody this morning and later today police will have to make a decision on whether to charge or release him, or will need to apply for extra time to question the suspect. Officers have been combing a semi-detached home in a quiet York cul-de-sac as part of their investigations, and a spokesman said the search of the property concluded last night. A spokesman said yesterday that\u00a0Miss Lawrence, who was 35 when she went missing, had not been found. Her parents, Peter and Joan, were told about the arrest shortly before it was made public and are being supported by trained officers. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, has urged people not to identify the arrested man, who is from the York area,\u00a0for fear of compromising the inquiry at what they describe as a 'critical phase'. He said: 'To ensure the investigation and legal process are not compromised or potentially damaged in any way during this critical phase in seeking the truth about Claudia's disappearance, North Yorkshire Police strongly advises the media and members of the public against identifying the man who has been arrested.

The father-of-two drank in the same pub as the missing university chef and lives within half a mile of her home in York. Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at work in March 2009. North Yorkshire Police began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of the city, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house.

A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said he was 'actively pursuing new leads' and that his team had made'significant progress' since the force began reviewing the case in 2013. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef. The arrest came days after police released previously unseen CCTV of a mystery man caught on camera walking towards the back of her terraced house on the evening she was last known to be alive. The footage, released to mark the anniversary of Miss Lawrence's disappearance, was taken at around 7.15pm on March 18 showing a man walking towards the rear of the missing chef;s house. The camera picks him up returning about one minute later and he appears to be carrying a bag over his shoulder. As he walks back to the main road he is seen to stop briefly as another man walks in front of him. Police appealed for information to identify both men and the arrest came five days later. Miss Lawrence's father, Peter, said yesterday: 'Any progress is good. It is encouraging to know that, following all the media activity over the last three weeks, from Claudia's 41st birthday to the sixth anniversary of her being missing, North Yorkshire Police continue to be active in seeking answers as to what has happened to Claudia.

The base rate has been held at a historic low 0.5 per cent for six years but the Bank of England has admitted that, far from raising rates, it could even cut them further to avoid prolonged deflation. Lower rates would encourage people to spend, rather than save, stimulating demand and pushing up prices. Ben Brettell, senior economist at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u2018It appears interest rates will be stuck at 0.5 per cent for some time yet \u2013 I don\u2019t see them rising until mid-2016 at the very earliest. The Office for National Statistics found the Consumer Prices Index between February 2014 and February 2015 stood at 0 per cent. With wages rising by 1.6 per cent while prices are flat, it means families should see their money going further each month. \u2018The Bank raises rates to curb inflation, but that is obviously not a problem at the moment, so they will keep them on hold.\u2019 John Hawksworth, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the Bank was now \u2018under no immediate pressure to raise interest rates\u2019. Andrew Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, suggested earlier this month that rates could be cut to zero because inflation had \u2018dropped like a stone\u2019. Low inflation, and even deflation, over a short period can be good for the economy and boost family finances, but a continuous fall in prices is harmful. By ALEX BRUMMER. THE GOOD NEWS.... AND THE BAD NEWS. Bargain prices in shops could be used by employers as an excuse to keep wages low, while workers could delay big purchases in anticipation that costs will fall further \u2013 triggering a downward spiral. Yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron seemed unconcerned by predictions that prices would fall further, saying Britain did not \u2018face the dangerous deflation that some other parts of Europe may potentially have a problem with\u2019. He welcomed the lowest inflation rate in 55 years, saying it was \u2018good news for family budgets\u2019, while Chancellor George Osborne declared that \u2018prices are frozen\u2019. Estimates released by the Office for National Statistics show the last time inflation was below 0 per cent was March 1960 \u2013 when Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister and The Beatles had just formed in Liverpool. The last major bout of deflation came during the Great Depression from 1929 to 1932. It did not end until Britain abandoned the gold standard which the then Chancellor Winston Churchill embraced in 1925. Before that, in the late 19th century the prices of goods, property and shares fell sharply provoking a banking crisis similar in scale and danger to that of 2007 to 2009. In the early 18th century the value of the pound was fixed against gold and prices were flat and falling until the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. Inflation measures the rise and fall of 700 goods and services, from energy prices to clothing. But it is the plummeting cost of petrol, diesel and food that has dragged down the rate to zero. In the past year, there has been a huge fall in the cost of global wholesale oil, causing prices at the pump to tumble by almost 17 per cent. An aggressive supermarket price war has also dragged down the inflation rate, as major stores have been forced to compete with budget rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. The ONS reported that food prices had fallen by more than 3 per cent in February compared with a year earlier. Economist Vicky Redwood, at Capital Economics, said: \u2018The UK is now within a whisker of deflation. \u2018It looks odds-on that inflation will turn negative in March, when the recent cut in gas prices by British Gas show up in the inflation figures for the first time. We still think that deflation in the UK will be a \u201cgood\u201d development, giving households\u2019 incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year.\u2019 Rob Wood, of Berenberg Bank, said there was \u2018a good chance inflation could turn negative next month\u2019. Economist Chris Williamson, at Markit, said: \u2018Rather than being a concern, the drop in inflation is a boon to the economy, providing households with greater spending power at a time when pay growth remains frustratingly weak.\u2019 Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as pay rises pull ahead of price increases, people had more money in their pockets, helping \u2018millions of", "abstract": "The Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates until mid-2016 due to the risk of deflation, according to economists. The inflation rate fell to 0% last month, the lowest level since 1960, and experts warn that Britain is now just one month away from deflation as food and petrol prices continue to fall. Delaying a rates rise would mean continued low interest rates for mortgage borrowers, but more misery for savers."}

Valentina Abinanti, from Galliate Italy, has encountered more than 70 tornadoes and 400 storms over the last decade. The 31-year-old was inspired by the 1996 disaster film Twister, but didn't begin chasing storms until she witnessed a tornado in 2003. Valentina Abinanti, one of few Italian storm chasers, risks her life to snap extraordinary photos of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes. Valentina has been photographing violent weather for more than a decade, and she has encountered more than 70 tornadoes and 400 storms. In May 2013, she survived a deadly tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma. The widest tornado in recorded history killed four fellow storm chasers and is remembered by the close-knit community as the darkest moment in storm chasing history. With a width of 2.6 miles, the record-breaking F-5 tornado destroyed everything in its path with extreme winds of nearly 300mph. In addition to the US, Valentina Abinanti chases storms in Italy; she spotted this massive waterspout in the coastal town of Vesima, near Genoa.

{"article": "The taxman enjoys a \u2018cosy\u2019 relationship with the accountants who help multinationals avoid billions in tax, a damning report will claim today. A powerful committee of MPs claims weak law enforcement means tax avoidance \u2013 and evasion \u2013 remains \u2018a risk worth taking\u2019. The Public Accounts Committee said HM Revenue and Customs is failing to sufficiently tackle \u2018widespread\u2019 tax avoidance by US giants, including Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said HMRC needs to come down hard on companies who use artificial overseas offices to avoid tax, and the firms that advise them. They must also do more to challenge the accountancy firms which help these multinationals to dodge their liabilities, the group will say. Major corporations have been accused of funnelling billions of pounds through tax havens such as Luxembourg and Ireland to reduce their bill. They are accused of exploiting a loophole which enables them to pay tax in the country where they are based, rather than where they sell their goods. By setting up \u2018artificial\u2019 offices in low-tax countries, they are able to pay a much lower annual levy on their profits. Today, the PAC will say that the taxman must do more to \u2018challenge\u2019 these tactics, saying: \u2018HMRC needs to show that it comes down hard on tax cheats and change the perception that it is far too tolerant of those who break the law by hiding their income. \u2018The current system still causes the odds to be stacked in favour of tax evaders using offshore accounts when the worst that will happen if they are caught is that they will pay the tax they owe and a fine.\u2019 Amazon, Starbucks and Vodaphone have all previously been found to funnel profits through tax havens, despite earning that money in the UK. It added: \u2018HMRC has not been sufficiently challenging of the manifestly artificial tax arrangements of multinationals.\u2019 The report was critical of large UK accountancy firms, such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers, which it claimed advised many multinationals on how to pay less tax in the UK through the use of complex schemes. They accused HMRC of not doing enough to \u2018challenge\u2019 this tax advice and instead focusing on the multinationals themselves. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee and a Labour MP, said: \u2018We remain concerned that HMRC\u2019s relationship with these large accountancy firms is too cosy, and it needs to get much tougher in challenging the advice they give to their clients. \u2018It is disappointing that HMRC has rejected our recommendation for a tougher code of conduct for tax advisers - a response which is out of kilter with its wider policy to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance. \u2018Furthermore, we do not believe there are enough prosecutions for tax evasion to act as an effective deterrent to those who break the law. As it stands, tax avoidance \u2013 and even evasion \u2013 can be a risk worth taking. \u2018We are not persuaded that HMRC and the Crown Prosecution Service are doing enough to prosecute serious tax evasion cases.\u2019 The report also found that part of the problem was Britain\u2019s hopelessly complex tax system. They said the number of different tax breaks open to businesses and individuals had grown under the Coalition by almost 100 to 1,140. These many tax reliefs were open to abuse and difficult to keep track of. The report said: \u2018For as long as the United Kingdom has such a complex tax code, opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance and evasion will continue to be exploited.\u2019 The report named management firms, such as\u00a0Pricewaterhouse Coopers, as being among those who advised their clients on how to reduce their tax bill. It added that \u2018HMRC must urgently transform its currently unacceptable levels of customer service\u2019. They claimed the taxman\u2019s target to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes was \u2018unambitious and inadequate\u2019 and noted that HMRC expected its performance in 2014-15 to be \u2018worse\u2019 than the previous year. It comes as the Treasury revealed it was joining forces with five other tax authorities to examine how digital multinational companies shift their profits to tax havens. David Gauke told MPs the co-operation was part of the diverted profits tax project - or so-called \u2018Google tax\u2019 - announced in the Budget last week and aimed at clamping down on tax avoidance. From the start of next month, companies who artificially funnel profits offshore to avoid paying UK tax will face a 25 per cent levy on that money. Yesterday, Mr Gauke told MPs: \u2018As part of this project I can confirm we are working with five other tax authorities to investigate and challenge how digital multinationals shift their profits to tax havens. \u2018For the first time we are gathering a full global picture of the tax risks these companies pose. That is invaluable in helping us to take decisive action.\u2019 A spokesman for HM Revenue", "abstract": "A report by the Public Accounts Committee claims that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is failing to tackle widespread tax avoidance by US giants, including Starbucks, Google and Amazon.

{"article": "The evidence for Mars once being habitable is steadily growing, as samples collected by Nasa\u2019s Mars Curiosity rover have revealed a key ingredient for life in Martian rock. Scientists found traces of nitrogen compounds known as nitrates, a vital source of nutrients for living things on Earth. The discovery is the latest feather in the cap for the theory that while Mars is barren and dry now, it was once habitable. Nasa scientists in California found evidence of nitrogen on Mars. Findings were made by Curiosity's (shown) Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. The scientists found nitrates - a source of nitrogen for life on Earth. It was likely created by asteroid impacts or lightning in volcanic plumes. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In their paper,\u00a0the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars. This could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on Mars. The Earth\u2019s nitrogen-rich atmosphere made life possible, but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery. Now, scientists believe they have found the answer: that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes, also made the atmosphere habitable. Geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere three billion years ago. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Carnegie Institution of Washington researchers explained in October 2014 that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis, as well as tectonic activity. While scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen, which makes up one fifth of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery. \u2018Discovery of indigenous martian nitrogen in Mars surface materials has important implications for habitability and, specifically, for the potential evolution of a nitrogen cycle at some point in martian history,\u2019 they wrote. The latest evidence was found by using the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), more commonly known as Curiosity. The discoveries were made at areas of Mars known as John Klein and Cumberland. The scientists note that this particular nitrate likely resulted from an asteroid impact, or lightning in a volcanic plume. Nitrogen is a key component of things like RNA, DNA and amino acids, and thus important for life. Nitrates themselves are important because they are a good source of nitrogen for living things. The next step will be to see if nitrates are still being produced on Mars. \u2018People want to follow the carbon, but in many ways nitrogen is just as important a nutrient for life,\u2019 said Dr Jennifer Stern, a science team member for the Mars Science Laboratory mission, reported LA Times. \u2018Life runs on nitrogen as much as it runs on carbon.\u2019 Shown is Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument.\u00a0In their paper the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars. This could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on Mars. This follows news in December 2014 when the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface. 'This temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively localised source,' said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Curiosity rover science team, at the time. 'There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.' Previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet. But none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden'venting' measured at Gale Crater, where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago. Curiosity landed in the 96 mile-wide (154km) crater in August 2012 and has been exploring the region ever since. Since it landed, conclusive evidence has been found that Mars once had water on its surface, and now scientists are hoping to provide an answer once and for all to the greatest question: Was there, or is there still, life on Mars as well?", "abstract": "NASA's Mars Curiosity rover has found evidence of nitrogen compounds known as nitrates, a vital source of nutrients for living things on Earth, in Martian rock, adding to the growing evidence that Mars was once habitable.

Kerri Lawson said she was distraught after she found her missing dog had been handed in by a member of the public to the vet, only for staff to decide to put the animal down - without informing her first. Ms Lawson said: 'Homer did have a few health problems, but he was not as bad as the vet said he was. 'They shouldn't have just gone ahead and done this without our say-so.' After Homer, who was 16-years-old, disappeared he was found by a member of the public and taken to\u00a0Cestria Vets in Chester-le-Street. Vets said he was having trouble breathing and within 24 hours he was put to sleep. Ms Lawson believes the arthritis in his legs, which caused him to drag his back leg and look ill, was known to the vets after Homer was injured in an accident 12 years ago. The student added: 'The problems were known to the vet and they said it was completely fine and there was no need to worry. 'They should have contacted the dog warden at the council to tell them he had been handed in. 'They could have waited. That way, we would have known he had been found - we would have had a point of contact. Miss Lawson said her pet had arthritis in his legs, but claimed veterinary staff had known about his condition. 'We had no way of knowing he'd been taken to the vets.' Homer was not microchipped but Ms Lawson said he had a docked tail and cauliflower ear, making him more distinctive. He was also not wearing a collar. Veterinary staff said they were forced to take action after the Labrador was found 'thin and experiencing breathing difficulties.' A spokeswoman for the practice said staff take their responsibilities to animals very seriously and said it would not have been ethical for them to have admitted such an unwell animal, thought to have been a stray, in such a 'desperate' condition. She added: 'Our obligation to stray animals is to provide such emergency treatment and pain relief as is appropriate and we treat many strays each year, before either successfully reuniting them with their owners, or passing them on to the relevant authorities. The dog was taken to Cestria Veterinary Centre in Chester-le-street, where the dog was then put down. 'Homer was brought in on Saturday morning by a member of the public. We checked our 'lost' register, in which we record details of missing animals reported to the surgery, but found no matching entry. 'We did not attempt to contact the dog warden, as we had previously been informed that they did not operate at weekends. 'The police no longer have legal responsibility for stray dogs and do not maintain a list.' The woman said the animal was examined by two veterinary surgeons who found he was agitated and distressed. Microchipping dogs is to become compulsory by April 2016, along with ensuring all details stored on the microchip are updated. Owners who don't comply can be fined \u00a3500. Recent research by the Dogs Trust found that 57 per cent of owners do not realise microchipping will become a legal obligation in 12 months time. They also found 46 per cent of British dog owners do not update their animal's microchip with address details when they move. This is in spite of 22 per cent of owners admitting their dogs strayed within 48 hours of them moving to a new area. The Dogs Trust estimate there are\u00a01,780,000 dogs in the UK who are not microchipped. Around 72 per cent of dog owners are unaware that they only have seven days to recover a missing dog from a Local Authority before they are rehomed or put to sleep. 'Obviously elderly, he was making clawing, repetitive movements of his front legs, but was unable to stand, even when supported and was barely responsive to his surroundings,' she added. 'His lung and heart sounds were muffled and indistinct, he was very thin and was experiencing breathing difficulties. 'They decided that his condition was terminal and considered his prognosis hopeless. 'No palliative treatment could have been provided which would have rendered his condition comfortable, and accordingly he was painlessly put down.

{"article": "The village of Aird Uig on the Isle of Lewis will be the best spot to view Friday's solar eclipse - and the only B&B in the area still has a room available for the spectacle. The west side of Lewis is the best place in the country to view the event, and Stornoway Astronomical Society has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across Britain and Europe wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse. Eclipse viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and B&Bs are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand. Scroll down for video. Visitors to the Isle of Lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse. Friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years and the best place to witness it is set to be in the Isle of Lewis. The tiny and remote hamlet of Aird Uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place in the UK to experience the deepest part of the solar eclipse - and shadow fever is starting to grip the area. Seacroft is Aird Uig's only B&B. Proprietor Sarah Taylor-Gerloch had sold both her spare rooms - but one, costing \u00a375-a-night, was to a couple of Dutch eclipse chasers. 'They have had to unfortunately cancel. He wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises. So the room is free,' said Mrs Taylor-Gerloch. Aird Uig is set to be the best place for viewing Friday's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent. The village of Aird Uig has only one B&B, and one couple's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse. The Isle of Lewis is als famous for the Callanish prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old. 'Ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until I told them. They were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them. 'We have a glorious view all the way to the Butt of Lewis but the eclipse has helped put Aird Uig on the map. It will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists. But it is a long way to come on the off chance. Aird Uig is a village on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Aird Uig is within the parish of Uig. Known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape. Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying \u00a3135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.' Aird Uig is a vital communications post, but residents want a community buyout of the military land. The moon will travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth and darkening the skies across Scotland and across Europe in the morning of Friday (20 March). It is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight.

Former CEO Dov Charney who created the concept behind the company's diverse ads was fired last year following the brand's willful misconduct claims that he 'acted inappropriately' and 'harassed employees.' The New York Post obtained the the email written on March 18 by model caster Phira Luon that read, '\u201c[The] company is going through a rebranding image, so we will be shooting models moving forward.' Leaked email: A leaked email written by model casting agent Phira Luon said the company would only be hiring'real models' not 'Instagram hoes' 'Real models. Not Instagram hoes or THOTs,' he continued in the email meant for employee eyes only. THOTS is an acronym for the saying, 'That ho over there.' After the email surfaced, Luon replied with an apology for what he wrote and said it 'was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy/views in anyway,\u2019 reports\u00a0News.com.au. News.com.au also reported that just last week, American Apparel\u2019s new senior vice president of marketing, Cynthia Erland, allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were 'too short and round,' three sources who were at the meeting told News.com.au. \u201cIt\u2019s become a running joke around the office \u2014 like, \"I can\u2019t do this, I\u2019m too short and round,' \u00a0said one employee who alleges they heard heard the remark. 'I\u2019ve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so,' that employee added.

Erland responded toNews.com.au in a statement that said, 'This is completely false. American Apparel embraces body types of all shapes, ethnicities and sizes, and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this.' American Apparel is notorious for their ads of scantily clad 'amateur models' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from'real women' around the globe. Despite the company's public attempt to distance themselves from their old image, the American Apparel website still says nothing about their desire to use more conventional models. \u2018We find our models all over the world, through online submissions, word of mouth, and in retail stores, where we've been known to do an impromptu test shoot or two. Our ads have always been indicative of a time and place in American Apparel's identity, which has evolved into a 12,000 employee worldwide collaboration. Explore the online ad archives for a closer look at our ads featuring models, factory inner-workings and the global vernacular that inspires us,\u2019 the website states. One rebranding change made obvious on the website last week is the company\u2019s choice to airbrush out some of the models' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins. Nip no nip: The model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right. Animal first reported that the changes could be seen on the company's\u00a0lingerie page\u00a0in the 'new' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing was edited to be much less exposed. Charney's replacement CEO Paula Schneider has said she is attempting to make the brand'relevant to millennials' without it bordering on 'pornographic.' 'This is an edgy brand and it\u2019s always going to be an edgy brand, and it\u2019s about social commentary, it\u2019s about gay rights, and it\u2019s about immigration reform. It\u2019s about the things millennials care about,' Schneider told The New York Times in January. While many may welcome the company's attempt to shave away their previous image, some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin's world. Michelle Lytle, co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line TaTa Top thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls, the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies.

{"article": "First-time parents Kate and David Ogg were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live. Thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name Jamie, Kate asked to be able to hold the lifeless child, and told David to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace. What happened next was nothing short of a miracle. Scroll down for video. When Kate and David Ogg were told their newborn son Jamie had passed away on March 25, 2010, they took him in their arms and cradled him to keep him warm. Jamie and Emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story. In this mother's loving arms, the little boy started moving, and his breathing grew stronger. Hospital staff rushed back to his aid and together brought the baby back to life. Five years on, Jamie Ogg is a healthy, happy kid whose biggest problem regarding his troubled entry in the world is having a little brother who tells anyone who'll listen that he used to be dead but now he's alive. After years of trying to fall pregnant, the Queensland couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the 'pigeon pair' of a boy and girl. But just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births. Jamie was born first on March 25, 2010 and his sister Emily followed two minutes later. 'They were both born in their sac but Jamie didn't make a noise when they tore it open. Emily let out a big wail,' Ms Ogg told Daily Mail Australia. 'We looked over and everyone was crowding around Jamie - there was about 20 people in the room.\u00a0The vibe wasn't very good. When they were told the devastating news, Kate ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes. Doctors worked on Jamie for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents. The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out. After birth, skin-to-skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world. For Kate and David Ogg the point is all the more pertinent. The birth process is a stressful and exhausting time for the baby. Unicef advises mothers to hold their child in skin-to-skin contact to help their baby 'adapt to their new environment'. It means their 'heartbeat and breathing will be better controlled' and there is a wealth of evidence that suggests babies held in skin-to-skin contact are less stressed by the birth process. Unicef's advice states: 'We know that babies who have spent an hour in skin contact are significantly less stressed after the birth experience - this means their breathing and heart rate are more stable, they cry less, and when they start to feed, they digest their food better. 'A mother's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk. 'Your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees, whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler, and he is wet \u2013 it\u2019s like getting out of the swimming baths, you need to get dry and warm quickly.' Meanwhile Caroline Davey, chief executive of the premature baby charity, Bliss, echoed the importance of skin-to-skin contact. She said it is 'an essential part of family-centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive'. Ms Davey added: 'Evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby\u2019s heartbeat, lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies.\u2019 'He stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone. After 20 minutes they stopped working on him.' The doctor sat on the end of Ms Ogg's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out. He then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save Jamie. 'I saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use.\u00a0I took Jamie off the doctor, asked everyone to leave.\u00a0He was cold and I just wanted him to be warm,' she said. 'We had tried for years to have kids and I felt so guilty. I just wanted to cuddle him. I unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed. 'I know it sounds stupid, but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so I wasn't going to give up easily.

The Disney remake of the classic fairy tale stars English actress Lily James who has revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming while wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role. The $95million live-action fantasy ran in to controversy even before its release date amid accusations that digital trickery had been used to alter the 25-year-old actress's waist to make it appear smaller. Scroll down for video. Actress Lily James revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming because she was wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role. Hitting back: Last week Miss James (pictured as Cinderella) hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie. Miss James (pictured at the World Premiere of Disney's Cinderella insisted her slim look was achieved with the use of a corset alone. This was denied by Walt Disney Pictures and the film's director 54-year-old Sir Kenneth Branagh, while a representative for Miss James insisted the look was achieved with the use of a corset alone. But the row continued on Twitter today after the movie's public release, with many people critical of just how effective the item proved to be at shrinking her waist and others even calling for fans to boycott the movie. Rochelle Schattner wrote: 'Boycott #Cinderella by Disney for making Cinderella's waist disturbing to look at and setting up unrealistic expectations.'

Some have even called for fans to boycott the movie claiming Cinderella's tiny waistline sets up 'unrealistic expectations' Backlash: Some complained that Cinderella's small waist was not'setting a positive example for girls in today's society. Others described Cinderella's waist as 'nearly non-existent' as the Twitter backlash continued over the weekend. Janelle Walker added: 'Pretty sure Lily James's corset made her waist 4 inches round in #Cinderella. Not setting a positive example for girls in today's society.' A review of the film by vox.com was also critical of Cinderella's tiny waist. 'What's crazy about this version is that Cinderella ends up with a supernaturally thin waist, thanks to a corset that James has complained wouldn't let her swallow whole foods,' the review said. 'Is it just me, or is the animated Cinderella's waist actually slightly larger? And even if it's not, it's still weird to try to get an adult human being down to cartoon proportions. 'The message seems clear. On the most magical night of her life, Cinderella's waist is size negative two.' The row continued on Twitter today with many people critical of how effective the corset proved to be at shrinking Lily James's waist. Cinderella also found success internationally as it made $62.4million overseas including $25million in China, which was a record for a March opening there.

The Downton Abbey actress insisted she was healthy and 'always has been' and that she'shouldn't have to' field questions about her frame. She told E!

The owners of a prize-winning Irish setter who was wrongly thought to have been poisoned at Crufts have attacked the Kennel Club for its 'cold' attitude in dealing with the death of the dog. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. At first his devastated owners believed the dog had been giving cubes of beef laced with poison at Crufts, possibly by a rival, only for the Kennel Club to run tests which showed Jagger had eaten the it 28 hours after leaving the show in Birmingham. The animal's co-owners, Belgian couple Aleksandra and Willem Lauwers and Leicestershire-based Dee Milligan-Bott and her husband Jeremy Bott have criticised the way the Kennel Club handled the situation, and said they faced a barrage of emails from the organisation after the dog's death. 'We accept that we will never know the true facts of why, where and when Jagger ingested poison which resulted in his death,' the owners said in a joint statement, posted on their Facebook pages. 'We wish now to draw a line under this tragedy. 'We are extremely disappointed, the way the Kennel Club have handled the events surrounding the death of Jagger.' The owners said they would have welcomed 'expert advice' with how to deal with the situation and the ensuing press attention.

Jagger became ill when he returned\u00a0to the Lauwers family home in the city of Tongeren, in Belgium. The couple called a vet but he\u00a0suffered a fit and died before the vet arrived. Jagger - known by his show name Thendara Satisfaction - was owned by the couple's young son who was devastated at the death of his pet. A vet acting for the couple carried out an immediate post-mortem on Friday March 6, confirming suspected poisoning. The dog's owners said they had then contacted the Kennel Club by urgent email to its press office to report the dog's death and then faced a 'barrage' of emails from the organisation. Toxicology reports were sent to the Kennel Club last Saturday along with a timetable of Jagger's exact movements, the dog's owners said. Belgian dog owners Aleksandra Lauwers, centre, and her husband Willem Lauwers, were pictured speaking outside their home shortly after the death of their dog and son's pet Jagger, an Irish setter. Thendara Satisfaction, known as Jagger, won second in his class during the second day of Crufts. In a statement issued on Monday Crufts said it was 'inconceivable' that the dog had been given two fast-acting poisons at Birmingham's NEC between 28 and 36 hours earlier. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog-lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible. 'It is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death.' They said the poisons - identified as carbofuran and aldicarb - were fast acting and severe symptoms would have set in two to three hours after them being eaten. Jagger belonged to the Lauwers' son Jeremy who was very close to the three-year-old Irish setter. Jeremy Lauwers is pictured with Jagger as a puppy among a large litter of Irish setters owned by his parents. Aldicarb and carbofuran are insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the EU. Nick Edwards, senior information scientist for Veterinary Poisons Information Service, said: 'We would expect the clinical effects, if ingested by a dog, to be rapid in onset; normally between half an hour and three hours. 'After this time a combination of clinical effects, if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities, would likely be present, including weakness, collapse, diarrhoea, slow heart rate, difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation.' The comments from the Kennel Club about the poison were made after fears were raised that six dogs had fallen ill after performing at the dog show. There is no evidence to suggest any were poisoned at Crufts and the Kennel Club said there had never been a confirmed case of poisoning in the show's 124-year history. Dee Milligan-Bott was a co-owner of Jagger who took the animal to Crufts, where he achieved second in class. Jagger is thought to have died after", "abstract": "The owners of a prize-winning Irish setter who was wrongly thought to have been poisoned at Crufts have criticised the Kennel Club for its 'cold' attitude in dealing with the death of the dog. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. At first his devastated owners believed the dog had been giving cubes of beef laced with poison at Crufts, possibly by a rival, only for the Kennel Club to run tests which showed Jagger had eaten the it 28 hours after leaving the show in Birmingham."}

Jassem Emwazi said there are only \"false rumors\" circulating about his son. The elder Emwazi told the newspaper he has hired an attorney. The lawyer, Kuwait-based Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN on Tuesday that he was representing Jassem Emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that Mohammed Emwazi is Jihadi John. The lawyer called the father a \"victim of libel\" and said that he would soon hold a news conference. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that \"Jihadi John\" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. Jassem Emwazi's statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John's voice as her son's when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages. Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. \"Lie, lie, lie,\" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism. CAGE interacted with Emwazi before he joined the terror group, a member has said. CAGE released a recording last week that it said it taped of Mohammed Emwazi in 2009. In that recording, Emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by British intelligence service regarding a July 2005 terror attack in London.

Pacquiao spoke to CNN's Ivan Watson in an exclusive interview, where he spoke about the May 2 fight. Yes he could say that, since for their exploits in Las Vegas on May 2 he and Floyd Mayweather are expected to share a $300million (\u00a3218m) purse ($180m (\u00a3131m) to the Money Man, $120m (\u00a387m) to the PacMan). Pacquaio, in an exclusive interview with CNN, also reveals that the eldest of his five children played a major part in urging him to keep pursuing Mayweather for the showdown which is expected to draw a record US pay-per-view audience of four to five million buys. 'My son and daughter really wanted this fight to happen and they will be in the front row,' he says of the $6,000-plus seats he has reserved for them and his wife Jinker at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Manny Pacquiao trained in the Philippines before jetting to Los Angeles to continue his preparations. Pacquiao shows off his speed and power as he trains at Freddie Roach's Wild Card Gym. The Filipino star is now in Los Angeles to complete his training regime for his fight with Floyd Mayweather. 'Three years ago they said 'Daddy, I want you to fight Mayweather.

'It's been five years in the making\u2026and finally it's happening. The fans deserve it.' Of his massive pay-day, the PacMan says: 'I feel blessed and I owe a lot to those fans. First to God but also the fans because of their support.' Pacquiao, who uploaded a photo of his daughter on Instagram two weeks ago, says his children wanted fight.

{"article": "Three police officers have been questioned as part of an investigation into the suspicious death of 13-month-old Poppi Iris Worthington. Three police officers have been questioned over alleged misconduct relating to the suspicious death of a 13-month-old baby whose case has been shrouded in official secrecy. Little Poppi Iris Worthington, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, died in December 2012. But a draconian order imposed by judges has prevented any details of her death being revealed, despite a long-running police probe. During an inquest in October last year that lasted a mere seven minutes, a coroner simply ruled that the cause of Poppi's death was 'unascertained' and failed to disclose any other information. But it has now emerged that three officers from Cumbria Police have been questioned under caution over misconduct allegations. It can also be revealed that one officer, who was suspended after concerns that the force did not respond \u2018properly and appropriately\u2019 to the girl's death, has since retired from the force. The news comes after the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said it would be investigating whether opportunities to obtain 'key evidence' were 'identified and appropriately acted upon'. The IPCC said it received a referral from Cumbria Police on June 27 last year and began its independent investigation on July 2. The body has since spoken to 13 witnesses and three police officers, who have been interviewed under caution. But the watchdog refused to disclose a copy of the Cumbria Police referral, which gives details of the exact allegations under investigation. A spokesman said the public interest in openness and transparency is 'outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations'. After Poppi's death, a far-reaching injunction prevented the media from revealing various details about the case, including the hospital in which she died. The opening of the inquest in also took place in private. According to coroners' rules, inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved. But following a challenge by media groups, the senior coroner for Cumbria, David Roberts, wrote to the Attorney General to ask for a new hearing. Lawyers representing several newspaper groups - Associated Newspapers Limited, which publishes MailOnline, Times Newspapers Ltd and Guardian News & Media- had written to Mr Roberts to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful. One officer, who was suspended over allegations the force did not response 'properly' to the young girl's death, has also since retired from the force. Cumbria police is being investigated by the police watchdog. In a written reply to law firm RPC, Mr Roberts, said: 'My own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place, not least so that conclusions as to how, when and where Poppi Worthington came by her death can be recorded. The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley (pictured) 'Neither I nor Mr Smith has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the High Court. However, it is open to me to seek a fiat (order) from the Attorney General to pursue an application under section 13 of the Coroners Act for an Order that a fresh inquest is to be held and I will now be doing so.' The police investigation had led to the arrest of two people, including Poppi's father Paul Worthington, 46. Last week it emerged the 46-year-old and a 30-year-old woman arrested will not face further action. The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley. In a statement, an IPCC spokesman said: 'We are independently investigating the force's response to Poppi's death - whether its investigation was conducted thoroughly and appropriately and whether investigative opportunities to obtain key evidence in the investigation were identified and appropriately acted upon.' FOI officer Philip Johnston said: 'Enquiries by the police and the IPCC into the concerns arising from the circumstances of Poppi Worthington's death, including criminal matters relating to members of the public and issues of police conduct relating to Cumbria Constabulary, are currently ongoing.' He added: 'I have concluded the public interest in openness and transparency is at this stage outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations and the inquest and in maintaining confidence in the IPCC's law enforcement functions more generally.'", "abstract": "Three police officers have been questioned over alleged misconduct relating to the suspicious death of 13-month-old Poppi Iris Worthington, whose case has been shrouded in official secrecy.

{"article": "Labour supporters demanding an end to trivial speculation about their leader's kitchen are in for a disappointment: Ed Miliband has invited the cameras into his home again. Days after it emerged his \u00a32million house has a large family kitchen and a smaller 'functional kitchenette' upstairs, ITV is expecting to film him relaxing in at least one of them. Confusion about why the family have two kitchens deepened today, when it emerged that the larger family kitchen picture on Mr Milband's Christmas card last year is in fact used by the live-in nanny. The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room. Mr Miliband tried to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements on Friday, insisting he prefers the\u00a0'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras as part of a short film about his wife, Justine. The poky room the couple were pictured in last week, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed by a family friend to mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'. The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth \u00a32.5million. And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'. Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing. 'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail. 'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.' Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.' He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.' But now it has emerged that the kitchen will appear on screens again. ITV has already filmed David Cameron and Nick Clegg at home. An ITV told the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Cameron and Clegg have already been filmed in their kitchens and elsewhere and we are due to begin filming in Ed Miliband's home in the next day or two. We were always going to shoot in the family kitchen so we shall have to see what happens.' It was also claimed that the second bigger kitchen is used by the live-in nanny who looks after the couple's children Daniel and Sam. Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely' Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in the paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening. She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies. 'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking? 'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their \u00a32million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.' In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen. Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day. Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence \u2013 by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'. She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child. When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.' Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband. 'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his \u00a32million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.'

{"article": "(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or \"cat fight.\" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside. \"When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,\" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. \"Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.\" At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action. \"It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,\" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. \"I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.\" For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning \"How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?\" Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,\" she said. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives. Even years later, the fight club is still running and is \"better than ever,\" Mazur said. \"Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,\" Mazur said. \"It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).\" Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin.

Fordfield House Nursery has apologised unreservedly after the shocking failing in care was revealed in an Ofsted report. The youngster was only returned to the nursery - which caters for children under the age of five - after being found by someone from a nearby riding stables. Failing in care:\u00a0A toddler was left behind in the woods by\u00a0Fordfield House Nursery during a class outing. After the incident last December staff at the nursery in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, notified the inspector that a'serious incident' had occurred. It is believed the child, whose age and gender is unknown, was left behind in woodland at the end of the trip to the woods. The nursery has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones. Ofsted would not confirm how the child came to be left behind but their report states they issued 'compliance action'. This included a 'notice to improve' which asked the nursery to 'ensure children are kept safe on outings'. A welfare requirements notice was also serves which states the nursery must 'ensure staffing arrangements meet the needs of all children and ensure their safety'. New measures:\u00a0The nursery, pictured, has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones. It also states that they must 'ensure that children are adequately supervised and decide how to deploy staff to ensure children's needs are met'. It also asked them to 'identify the steps to be taken to remove, minimise and manage[...] risks and hazards'. Ofsted said it had also carried out a further inspection into the nursery and a report would be published 'in due course'. The report, which was published last month, said: 'The owner took immediate action following the incident. 'All outings have been stopped until relevant policies and procedures have been amended and fully implemented within the nursery. 'New mobile phones that will be used on outings have been purchased. We are satisfied with the action taken by the provider. The provider remains registered with Ofsted.'

A mother who has three children at the nursery said: 'I believe that the incident should not define what is a wonderful establishment. 'The nursery responded in the appropriate way and rather than dwell, they have put measures in place to stop any such incident - a direct result of human error - from happening again.

{"article": "A woman who fled with her son while fighting to prevent his circumcision will face imprisonment if she doesn't return and allow the surgery to proceed, a judge ruled Friday. In a stinging rebuke of the mother, Heather Hironimus, Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen said she had successfully dragged out a legal battle and was'reprehensible' for going missing with the boy and for conduct that has put the 4-year-old in a public spotlight'making him an object of curiosity and worse'. He found her in contempt and demanded she appear in court on Tuesday with the child or he would command police to find her. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Gillen said on Friday that Heather Hironimus could escape jail if she appears before him on Tuesday with the child. She will only avoid jail on the contempt charge, Gillen said, if she signs paperwork necessary to schedule the procedure that she initially agreed to in a legal document. 'This child has been placed in a light that provides much too much scrutiny for a little boy,' the judge said. 'I blame no one but the mother for that.' It was the latest dramatic turn in a case nearly as old as the boy himself, and one that has become a rallying cry for 'intactivists,' the circumcision opponents who say removing the foreskin is barbaric. Though Hironimus gave her blessing to circumcision in the parenting plan she reached with the boy's father, Dennis Nebus of Boca Raton, she later changed her mind, leading to a long court battle. Circuit and appellate judges have sided with the father. The father has called circumcision 'just the normal thing to do.' The mother said it's not worth the risks. After Hironimus, of Boynton Beach, refused to sign papers to allow the circumcision and after protesters spotlighted the case, potential surgeons have backed out of circumcising the boy. Both Nebus and the boy's doctors have received death threats. Meantime, the mother has stoked the protests and publicity, despite a court order not to, said May Cain, an attorney for the father, who appeared in court. 'She's willing to flee with him and plaster him all over the Internet and do anything she can,' Nebus said. 'She's stated that she's going to do everything that she can to stop it.' Nebus said he has not seen his son since Feb. 19. Thomas Hunker, the attorney for Hironimus, said he did not know where his client was. After the hearing, Hunker said 'We're concerned for the child's wellbeing and emotional condition.' Though circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., a majority of boys still undergo the procedure, though a bubbling movement against it has developed. The CDC says medical evidence shows benefits clearly outweigh risks, and that circumcision can lower a male's risk of sexually transmitted diseases, penile cancer and urinary tract infections. Protesters in December in Florida, who are known as 'intactivists' have made the four-year-old's case their cause celebre and organized a series of protests.", "abstract": "A judge has ruled that a woman who fled with her son while fighting to prevent his circumcision will face imprisonment if she doesn't return and allow the surgery to proceed.

A former intelligence chief has quit his role with Britain\u2019s top crime fighting agency to keep a lucrative directorship with scandal-hit HSBC. Baron Evans of Weardale, the former director-general of MI5, has resigned from the board of the publicly-funded National Crime Agency (NCA) after just a year, due to a \u2018perceived conflict of interest\u2019 as the bank has come under fire over tax-dodging allegations. In a statement, the crossbench peer admitted there has been \u2018a lot of controversy\u2019 over claims that HSBC enabled clients of its Swiss private banking arm to avoid tax. But he chose to keep his \u00a33,000-a-day role with the financial giant rather than stay with the law enforcement agency which is Britain\u2019s equivalent of the FBI. His decision to quit the NCA and stay with HSBC could put further pressure on Rona Fairhead, who is clinging on to her well-paid positions as a director of the bank and chairman of the BBC\u2019s governing body. Lord Evans, who was director-general of MI5 from 2007 to 2013, wrote in his resignation letter: \u2018There has been a lot of controversy over the alleged actions of HSBC clients and of the bank itself in recent weeks. I believe that though there is no actual conflict of interests there could be a perceived conflict of interests between my two roles.\u2019 His resignation was \u2018reluctantly\u2019 accepted last week by the head of the NCA, Keith Bristow, who said: \u2018I have accepted the resignation of Lord Evans with great regret. While I do not believe there is an actual conflict of interests, any perception of one has the potential to adversely affect the reputation of the NCA. Jonathan has made an enormously valuable contribution to the NCA over the past 15 months.\u2019 After more than 30 years in the security service, Lord Evans retired in 2013 and soon afterwards became a non-executive director of HSBC, earning \u00a3125,000 for 40 days work a year. He also became a member of a committee the bank set up to combat financial crime, in the wake of the scandal that saw it fined \u00a31billion in the US for allowing Mexican drug gangs to launder money through its accounts. Other members of the team include Bill Hughes, a former head of the NCA\u2019s predecessor the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the former head of HM Revenue & Customs, Dave Hartnett. But despite their efforts, HSBC has been dragged into another scandal that could lead to a police investigation. Baron Evans of Weardale\u00a0esigned from the board of the publicly-funded National Crime Agency, pictured during a training exercise. Earlier this year leaked documents emerged that suggested HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank helped clients dodge millions of pounds in tax. The French authorities have since agreed that the account data, now held by the taxman, can be shared for the \u2018purpose of investigating criminal offence\u2019 and a meeting to discuss a probe has been held at which the NCA was present alongside the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Crown Prosecution Service, City of London Police and EuroJust. The NCA, set up to tackle organised crime across the country, has said it has no \u2018live role\u2019 in any probe into the bank\u2019s activities. Lord Evans was appointed a non-executive director of the newly established NCA in December 2013. Its annual accounts show he was paid less than \u00a35,000 in its first few months and would be paid less than \u00a315,000 a year. HSBC will come under fresh attack from MPs tomorrow when the Public Accounts Committee quizzes former taxman turned bank adviser Mr Hartnett. Chairman Margaret Hodge said there was still a lot of work to be done in exposing tax-dodging by British companies. \u2018I would be amazed if HSBC were alone.\u2019", "abstract": "Lord Evans, the former director-general of MI5, has resigned from his role with the National Crime Agency (NCA) after just a year, due to a perceived conflict of interest with his directorship at HSBC. Evans chose to keep his \u00a33,000-a-day role with the bank rather than stay with the law enforcement agency, which is Britain\u2019s equivalent of the FBI. His decision to quit the NCA and stay with HSBC could put further pressure on Rona Fairhead, who is clinging on to her well-paid positions as a director of the bank and chairman of the BBC\u2019s governing body."}

Kemeys Folly, in Langstone, near Newport in South Wales, starred in the popular Channel 4 programme six years ago when it was converted into a six-bedroom luxury house - and now owners Sarah and Dean Berry have put the unusual property up for sale. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of a castellated 18th Century hunting lodge with the construction of a state of-the-art glass extension. Scroll down for video. Kemeys Folly (pictured) starred in popular property show Grand Designs six years ago. Its owners have now put the unusual home up for sale. Owners Sarah and Dean Berry have now put the unusual Grade II listed six-bedroom home up for sale for \u00a31,999,950. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of the old hunting lodge with a state of-the-art glass extension. The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the tower in 2005, which was being sold by a couple who had quickly realised that there was far too much work to do, and put it back on the market. Work on Kemeys started in January 2007 and over the next year an old extension was demolished, the outside of the tower was re-pointed and the inside was stripped as much as the building's listed status would allow. Now, The Grade II listed home boasts six bedrooms, five of which have en-suite bathrooms - and including a master bedroom which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. Sitting in 23 acres of land the property also boasts a cinema room in the older part of the building and outside there is a large pool house with swimming pool and changing facilities. The folly also has four stables which back directly onto a paddock. The glass extension takes full advantage of the stunning hilltop location - on a clear day you can see 11 counties as well as the two Severn road bridges and the Bristol Channel. The owners say the surrounding woodland is perfect for long walks, and which features lots of wildlife, including deer. Something of a local landmark, the original building was a hunting lodge dating back to the 1700s and was at one point owned by the Sheriff of Monmouth. The folly is situated in the heart of the Usk Valley in South Wales and has a roof terrace which enjoys this view over the  countryside. The house boasts a master bedroom and en suite which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. It was struck by lightning in 1890, rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and was eventually converted into a house for the Sheriff of Monmouth. The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the folly in 2005 and spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it and bringing it up to scratch. Mrs Berry said: 'We bought it with a view to carrying out significant work on it, renovating the tower and extending it. 'It was one of those love at first sight moments. We were in London at the time but knew we wanted to move back here to where we grew up. 'Neither of us even knew it existed but when we saw it we wanted it. It was just outstanding.' The couple spent a huge amount of time with planners to agree on a concept for the home that everyone was happy with. She said: 'The idea was to keep the original features of the main building, such as the beautiful exposed stonework, but not to mimic what was already there in the extension. 'We wanted to create new sections that helped to tell the story of the building through the years and were an expression of the 21st century. 'Living here has been such fun.' A former hunting lodge, the folly was built in 1712 by local landowner George Kemeys. It was struck by lightning in the late 1890s, partially rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and converted into a house for TE Watson, the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. The couple are selling as they are downsizing but say: 'Whoever takes Kemeys Folly on now is going to enjoy such an amazing life here.' The house is for sale for \u00a31,999,950 with Chewton Rose.

{"article": "Roy Hodgson is holding his cards close to his chest with England\u2019s squad due to be announced this week. England meet Lithuania at Wembley in Euro 2016 qualifying on March 27 before travelling to the Juventus Stadium in Turin for a friendly with Italy four days later. The last time England played was in mid-November, when they beat Scotland and Slovenia with Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Rickie Lambert and Saido Berhaino. Yet the contenders have arrived. Harry Kane, Daniel Sturridge, Charlie Austin and Danny Ings are among those that could be selected, and Hodgson is set to pick four from the eight available. So, stick or twist? Well, here are the numbers that may sway Hodgson\u2019s decision one way or another. England captain Wayne Rooney, pictured celebrating against Scotland, looks a certainty to be picked. Harry Kane, Tottenham Hotspur. Against Arsenal on February 7, Kane scored twice in front of watching England manager Hodgson to win the north London derby. It was deja vu on March 8, when the 21-year-old added two more against Queens Park Rangers yet again in front of the England manager. If that doesn\u2019t convince, perhaps these statistics will:. \u2022 Only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo (both 41) have scored more than Kane (26) in all competitions this season. \u2022 Only Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa (both 17) have more Premier League goals but Kane (16) did not start a game until November 9. \u2022 Kane has scored 14 in his last 13 Premier League games and became the fourth player in history to score in six consecutive away games. \u2022 His goals have contributed a staggering 19 points in the Premier League this season. And we could go on. Kane is used to leading a 4-2-3-1 at Tottenham, and would have to adapt to a partnership in Hodgson\u2019s classic 4-4-2 midfield diamond formation. Even so, the question is not should Hodgson pick the highest scoring Englishman, but rather how could he not? VERDICT: SHOULD GO. Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane beats Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Robert Green last week. Kane celebrates one of his many goals this season as the striker gets noticed in the Premier League. Kane will hope to be involved in Roy Hodgson's England squad when it is announced this week. Charlie Austin, Queens Park Rangers. QPR vs Tottenham was billed as the battle of the two best kids on the playground yet, with teacher watching on, Kane overshadowed his potential England team-mate. But Austin, seemingly carrying the third-bottom team in the Premier League, remains the fourth top goalscorer (15), just one behind the man with better service at White Hart Lane. Shoot on sight, seems to be the strategy. Austin ranks first in total shots (61) and shooting accuracy (67 per cent) out of the eight potential England forwards, having played more minutes (2,169) than any of the others this season. Austin\u2019s goals have contributed 45 per cent of QPR\u2019s points this season, and manager Chris Ramsey reckons he and Kane would complement each other in a front two partnership. VERDICT: SHOULD GO. QPR striker Charlie Austin scores against Arsenal at Loftus Road earlier in March in the Premier League. England hopeful Austin is in contention to be selected by Hodgson when his squad is announced this week. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United. Rooney, no longer being restricted to deep midfield, was restored to an attacking role recently, and scored twice against Sunderland to show he hasn\u2019t lost his touch. He\u2019s joint-first for chance conversion (29 per cent) and assists (four), and Hodgson previously announced he has no intention of using him as anything other than a striker. Was that a bluff? Rooney could still be used as an attacking midfielder or auxiliary forward behind two strikers, without wishing to step on Raheem Sterling\u2019s toes as No 10. Rooney looked comfortable up top against Arsenal on Monday night, scoring Manchester United\u2019s only goal in a 2-1 defeat. \u2018He\u2019s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer,\u2019 Hodgson said in February. \u2018It would take a lot from a 19 or 20-year-old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps.\u2019 Never say never, but Rooney surely has a place reserved, whether that be as a striker or otherwise. VERDICT: SHOULD GO. Wayne Rooney has become the regular face of England and is set to be selected once more by Hodgson. Rooney celebrates Ashley Young's wining goal at St James' Park for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United. Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool. Sturridge is just returning from a thigh and hamstring injury that cost him five months, but has the third best minutes-per-goal ratio (175) of the eight strikers.

In April 2011, when the Prince last visited the U.S, he opted to use a private jet owned by Texan financier Joe Allbritton to meet with President Barack Obama and give an address to an agriculture conference. In March 2007, he used the Royal Flight to travel to Scotland instead of using a more environmentally friendly alternative. He flew on the HS125 from RAF Lyneham, near his Highgrove Estate to the Queen Mother's former country house near Balmoral. At the time, environmentalists estimated that the carbon footprint for the 500-mile trip was more than 15,000kg per passenger - compared to a mere 60kg for travelling by train.

Abigail Moody flew into a jealous rage and brutally attacked Melissa Benhamou after finding out she had slept with her partner Sam Bridge, Worcester Crown Court heard. Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year. Abigail Moody (left) flew into a jealous rage and brutally attacked Melissa Benhamou (right) after finding out she had slept with her partner Sam Bridge, Worcester Crown Court heard. Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge (pictured with Moody) on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year. But when Miss Benhamou arrived, the 19-year-old grabbed her hair, and kicked and punched her to the ground. She smacked her the young woman's head against a radiator, fracturing her eye socket - before Moody chastised her victim for getting blood on her trainers. Worcester Crown Court heard she also insulted her Pakistani heritage before leaving her in a pool of blood. Abigail Moody has been given 18 months in a young offender's institute after the attack. Moody, from Bromsgrove, was yesterday sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institution after admitting racially aggravated grievous bodily harm. Sentencing, Judge Robert Juckes QC, said: 'This matter was a well planned, carefully thought out assault on a girl. 'It was a vicious attack, accompanied by racial abuse.' Prosecutor Peter Grice said the two women had been friends until April 2012, when Moody assaulted Miss Benhamou because she had slept with her boyfriend. In April last year, she slept with Moody's boyfriend once again and became pregnant before miscarrying the baby weeks later. Mr Grice told the court that Miss Benhamou was contacted on Facebook by a profile in the name of the unfaithful boyfriend - but it was Moody posing as him. She tricked her former friend into going to an address and Moody even arranged for a taxi to bring her there. On arrival, Miss Benhamou was sent a message telling her the door was open and to walk straight in. But, in the corridor outside the flat, Moody 'lay in ambush' and grabbed her by the hair before dragging her inside. She racially abused her and stamped on Miss Benhamou's phone after she knocked it to the ground. The court was told Miss Benhamou slept with Moody's boyfriend twice, falling pregnant the second time, before miscarrying the baby a few weeks later. Miss Benhamou was lured to a flat in\u00a0Bromsgrove after Moody pretended to be her boyfriend on Facebook. Once there she was attacked, leaving her with injuries to her eye (right) Mr Grice said: 'The defendant repeatedly punched her victim, causing the victim to hit her head against a radiator.' Moody then accused Miss Benhamou of getting blood on her trainers and said: 'You slept with my man - you got pregnant with his kid.' Eventually the victim, who suffered a fractured eye socket, a possible blood clot in her eye, bruising and a chipped tooth, went to a nearby food outlet to get help. John Lynch, defending, said it was a 'nasty assault' and Moody had given a full and frank account of it to police.

Durst, 71, was sensationally acquitted of the 2001 murder of neighbor Morris Black and has long been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathie, and then murdering long-time friend Susan Berman because she knew too much. He was shockingly caught on tape saying 'I killed them all,' at the end of the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.

Donald Broom, Emeritus Professor of Animal Welfare at the University of Cambridge, told MailOnline earlier this week that the most people would notice that many of the common birds stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer. 'Farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night,' he said, before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks, they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on,\u2019 he added.

He predicted that dogs would probably be more alert and pay more attention to what's going on around them more than usual because they will be'slightly surprised'.

The top-earning private dentists in the UK made a collective turnover of almost \u00a31billion in 2014 \u2013 up 22 per cent on 2010 \u2013 with treatments including \u2018smile analyses\u2019 and sonic polishing, research shows. Analysis by finance provider LDF says the rise is because Britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private treatment. One of the increasingly popular procedures is so-called smile analysis, when a dentist assesses the width of the mouth, its symmetry and the extent to which teeth are even and white. Dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile. The process typically costs \u00a3100. But any subsequent treatment such as braces, crowns being fitted on uneven teeth or whitening can be up to \u00a310,000 depending on what a patient decided to have done. Other procedures include sonic clean and polishing \u2013 for about \u00a3130 a session \u2013 which uses air and tiny particles to blast teeth and remove stains caused by coffee, chocolate and wine. Some private dentists have renamed their surgeries \u2018spas\u2019, greeting patients with scented candles in the waiting room and offering facials, foot massages and aromatherapy. Separate figures from the British Association of Cosmetic Dentistry estimate the number of people seeking such treatments is growing by 40 per cent a year. Experts say adults are becoming more self-conscious and worry that their personal life and career may be hindered if they don\u2019t have nice teeth. Britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private dental treatment. Also, medical advances have replaced traditional train-track braces with clear, barely noticeable devices costing \u00a36,000. Many are having these fitted in the run-up to major events where they will be extensively photographed such as family weddings or milestone birthdays. Peter Alderson, of LDF, said: \u2018British people have taken to cosmetic dentistry in a big way, and that\u2019s reflected in rising incomes for top dentists. \u2018Increasing numbers of dental patients are starting to explore cosmetic treatments like laser whitening, and are willing to pay significant amounts of money for cutting-edge services, especially if they are delivered in a more exclusive, private clinic-style environment. \u2018The biggest dental groups are able to invest very heavily in their practices\u2019 equipment, furnishings and IT systems, and that has raised the stakes in the profession markedly. The younger generation of dental clients \u2013 those that are more comfortable with paying for cosmetic dentistry \u2013 expects enhanced services such as online booking and text message reminders as well as cutting-edge treatments. \u2018If dentists want to make the most of the demand for cosmetic dentistry, they need the type of apparatus and environment that brings in clients, but that type of equipment routinely costs tens of thousands of pounds.\u2019 One popular procedure is \u2018cosmetic bonding\u2019, in which grey fillings or chipped teeth are painted over to make them almost invisible, costing up to \u00a31,000. Laser whitening is increasingly being offered for about \u00a3100. Nissit Patel, of Progressive Dentistry in Putney, south-west London, said: \u2018Over the past five years, I have seen a huge increase in adult orthodontics, primarily for cosmetic reasons. In my practice, the business has at least doubled in the past three years.\u2019 He added that many of his patients came to him shortly before weddings or birthdays.", "abstract": "Private dentists in the UK are making a collective turnover of almost \u00a31bn, up 22% on 2010, due to a rise in cosmetic treatments.

The 40lb shells, which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador named after Sir Barnes Wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb. His owner, John Brewin, phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in Sandwich Bay, Kent, on Sunday. Scroll down for video. Dramatic: The seven shells were detonated by bomb experts out at sea at Sanwich Bay, Kent. Explosion: The shells,\u00a0which are believed to date from the 1860s, were sniffed out by a black Labrador. Sniffed out: Barnes Wallis the black Labrador. Experts from the Royal Logistics Corps Bomb Disposal Team arrived and, with Barnes' help, uncovered another six shells.

'The seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb Black Powder shells. 'The first one was found by my black Labrador Barnes Wallis and the others were then located by the local Coastguard Team, assisted by Barnes again.' Mr Brewin named his dog after Sir Barnes Wallis, a British aviation engineer who invented the 'bouncing bomb' used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Adrian Hendry, 43, who lives nearby, said: 'The explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast. 'It's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after Barnes Wallis - an amazing coincidence really.' Uncovered: Bomb disposal experts arrived and, with Barnes' help, found another six shells on the beach. Curious: Owner John Brewin said the shells, pictured, are not the first to be dug up by his pet. Sir Barnes Wallis: Inventor of the 'bouncing bomb' Barnes Wallis was a British aviation engineer who is famous for designing the 'bouncing bomb' that was used in the Dambusters Raid of 1943. Born in Derbyshire, Wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft. When the Second World War began, Wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at Vickers' engineering. He came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter's marbles across a tub of water by catapault. But it took more than a year to convince RAF chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted. Once he was given the go-ahead, he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design. The final solution, called Upkeep, was a cylindrical bomb, weighing four tons, spinning backwards at 500 rpm. It had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph. In the dark. In the middle of hilly, forested west German territory. Operation Chastise, dubbed the 'Dambusters Raid' was carried out overnight on the 16 May 1943 by the 617 Squadron of the RAF - specially-created for the job - that was led by Guy Gibson. Two of the dams were breached, leading to serious flooding of the surrounding area. However, it did not make a significant dent in the country's industrial production, as hoped. The most significant outcome of the raid was the positive effect it had on morale - giving Allied troops, and those left at home, a much-needed boost.

In the much-loved Road Runner cartoons, it seemed that anything was possible \u2013 but the mayhem on the screen was born writers that had incredibly strict rules to abide by.

Shah Bibi Tarakhail lost most of her right arm and her right eye when she mistook a discarded grenade outside her home for a rock, and it exploded, ripping her body with shrapnel and killing her brother. The children were taken to a NATO hospital in Kabul. Austin, who at the time was a U.S. Army civil affairs officer, saw them there. She brought them a DVD player and some Disney movies, along with what comfort she could. 'Capt. Sam,' as she was known, also linked up with the nonprofit Los Angeles-based group Children of War and arranged for the children to be flown to Southern California for treatment and therapy. The children stayed with foster families. Doing better: The nurse was happy to see the children who were once badly injured by an explosion were now happy and smiling and nearly fully healed. After the explosion: Austin is pictured here with one of the children she helped in the explosion. Injured: The victims say they were happy to see Austin who is pictured here right after the blast in their village. On Friday Austin, who is now an operating room nurse in Virginia, finally saw the children again. She received hugs, smiles, and even a drawing of a heart from Abdul. 'I love Sam and she's a good lady...she was there for me always,' he said in a telephone interview. 'I'm happy when I see her,' Shah Bibi said. 'I say thank you for everything: you take me outside, you take me inside, you tell me stories, give me candy.' All smiles: The children are doing much better and once they are fully healed they will be able to return to Afghanistan where they are from. Austin remembered Abdul as 'unwaveringly smiling and singing' in the Afghanistan hospital but he had a surprise for her. 'To see Abdul walk was amazing,' she said. 'To see his smile again, and the joy that he has. His spirit is so good.' As for Shah Bibi, she was traumatized and could barely talk, Austin said.

{"article": "Illegal immigrants would be put on a plane before they get the chance to appeal under Conservative plans to rip up deportation laws. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to implement a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later'. The rules, to be brought in if the Tories are re-elected, would apply to anyone with an expired visa or those living in Britain without permission. The only exceptions would be asylum-seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible' harm if sent back to a dangerous country. The move seeks to end the racket of thousands of illegal immigrants being able to prolong their stay in Britain for months or even years by lodging a string of appeals and judicial reviews. The only exemptions to the new rules would be asylum seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible harm' if sent back to their home country. File image used. Officials also hope the crackdown \u2013 central to Tory manifesto plans to slash net migration \u2013 will save the taxpayer money. Migrants will still be able to appeal \u2013 but must do so from their country of origin. It is thought that fewer people will then attempt to play the system, sparing the UK taxpayer the cost of holding them in an immigration centre or paying for housing. The Conservative manifesto is yet to be completed and has undergone a series of re-writes in recent weeks. But senior Government sources say it will once again contain a target to slash net migration \u2013 with renewed focus on removing more people from the country as a way of achieving it. Mrs May is pressing for a firm restatement of the Prime Minister's 'tens of thousands' target \u2013 despite the fact it was missed spectacularly. David Cameron remains committed to slashing net migration \u2013 the number of people arriving in the country against those leaving \u2013 which currently stands at 298,000. By increasing the number of illegal immigrants who are removed from the country, it makes it easier to hit the target. Until now, the focus has been primarily on reducing the numbers coming in. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to implement a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later' should the Tories gain re-election. Mrs May, hinting at the plans earlier this month, said: 'I think we will keep the target. It is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system, but also about making sure that those people who shouldn't live here actually leave.' Tory insiders are satisfied the so\u2013called 'non-suspensive appeals' policy is legally water-tight and will not be derailed by Labour's Human Rights Act. On a smaller scale, Mrs May has for the past year been deporting foreign criminals under an identical 'deport first, appeal later' regime. So far the move has seen 600 offenders sent home before their appeals were exhausted. Deportees and their lawyers lodged a series of judicial reviews against the scheme in the hope it would be ruled unlawful. But in a string of test cases, judges found there was no barrier to making foreign offenders lodge their claims from their home countries. Those kicked out so far include a Nigerian woman who claimed to have a human right to a family life in the UK \u2013 despite being convicted of repeatedly beating her own child. Under the old system she could have delayed her case for years by lodging a string of appeals in the British courts. With an estimated one million illegal immigrants living in the UK, the Home Office has a large group to target. But campaign groups have raised concerns that the department lacks the resources to track them all down. MigrationWatch said the \u00a31.8billion Britain spends securing borders and removing illegal immigrants and foreign criminals was 'clearly inadequate' \u2013 and six times less than the estimated \u00a312billion overseas aid budget. While the number of migrants arriving in the UK has increased sharply in recent years, the number being removed has stayed flat at around 100,000 every year. The Mail understands Mr Cameron is considering including two different targets in the final manifesto. In addition to the 'tens of thousands' target, he could also opt for a specific pledge to slash net migration from outside the EU \u2013 which, unlike EU migration, ministers can fully control. Earlier this week, research based on an analysis of the British Social Attitudes Survey found voters in every different ethnic group in Britain want immigration reduced. Some 60 per cent of Asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced \u2013 38 per cent by a lot.", "abstract": "The UK Conservative party is proposing a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later' for illegal immigrants, which would apply to anyone with an expired visa or those living in Britain without permission. The only exceptions would be asylum-seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible' harm if sent back to a dangerous country. The move seeks to end the racket of thousands of illegal immigrants being able to prolong their stay in Britain for months or even years by lodging a string of appeals and judicial reviews."}

The Iowa couple lost their adopted son Gabriel last year in a horrific turn of events, just weeks after his birth mother decided she wanted him back. But this week, as Gabriel's father, Drew Weehler-Smith, 18, received a 50-year prison sentence for murdering the little boy, the pair have revealed they are the proud parents to a baby daughter - and are expecting a second child any day now.

Precious: The women were contacted by a mom-to-be who had heard their story and was looking for adoptive parents to take custody of her newborn daughter. New home: Little London appears pretty with her parents, Rachel and Heidi McFarland. The women were able to adopt their baby, London, after being contacted by a mom-to-be who was touched by their story and had been searching for adoptive parents. Before the adoption process started however, the two decided to try and have a baby on their own. Heidi McFarland is now eight months pregnant. The two are expecting another little girl, who they intend to call Vienna, The Des Moines Register reported. The news follows an emotional week for the two, following the sentencing of Drew Weehler-Smith. Four-month-old Gabriel King McFarland was found unresponsive on April 22, 2014, by his mother after she left the baby in the care of his father at their Des Moines home. The boy later passed away, with an autopsy showing Gabriel of an abusive head trauma, which authorities say he suffered at the hands of his dad, who was 17 at the time. They believe Weehler-Smith shook the boy. The. tragedy came just a month after the teen mother, Markeya Atkins, changed. her mind about giving him up for adoption and took him back from the. women who had brought him up as their own. Loss: Four-month-old Gabriel McFarland died on. April 22 last year after he suffered an abusive head trauma while in the care of. his teenage father. Gabriel's mother had just taken him back from. adoption. Sentenced:\u00a0On Wednesday Drew Weehler-Smith, 18, received a 50-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty in January to second-degree murder in the death of his son, Gabriel, last year. Prison: Weehler-Smith's adoptive parents believe his inexperience with children contributed to the death of his son. He has also struggled with addiction. Grief: Heidi and Rachel McFarland in court in Des Moines this week for the sentencing of Drew Weehler-Smith. Gabriel's mother, Markeya Atkins,. had left him in the care of his father so she could run errands around 7.25pm on April 22, police said. About 25. minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone. charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the. mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith. Atkins asked her friend to return to the. apartment but when she did, she saw the father driving away without. the baby. She. notified the mother, who rushed home and found Gabriel limp and not. breathing in a glider chair. 'Someone left my. friend's baby that they were baby-sitting by themselves, and the baby's. blue,' the friend can be heard saying on the 911 calls, with Atkins crying in the background: 'He just left him here.' Atkins' friend performed CPR before emergency medical personel took over. But the boy was pronounced dead at hospital. Weehler-Smith, a junior at Des Moines Roosevelt High. School, was initially charged with neglect of a dependent person but the charge was upgraded to murder. He was tried as a adult, and plead guilty to second-degree murder. On Wednesday morning, he was sentenced to 50 years prison, the maximum sentence. Rachel McFarland told The Des Moines Register after the sentencing that she will probably never be able to forgive Weehler-Smith, but she believes his adoptive parents, who are also lesbians, have not been given enough credit for being amazing people. 'They are really wonderful women,' Rachel said. 'They've lost their son; they've lost their grandson. Our families have been through hell.'

{"article": "The case of the 'Gone Girl' physiotherapist and her boyfriend who were accused of staging her kidnapping has taken another strange twist \u2013 a group who are claiming to be the kidnappers have demanded an apology from the police. Densie Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents' home. After her \u2018release\u2019 police accused them of staging the kidnapping \u2013 a claim they both strongly denied. Now the San Francisco Chronicle has received a string of anonymous emails from the apparent kidnappers in which they compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11 and claim they will strike again. Scroll down for video. The self-proclaimed kidnappers behind the Gone Girl abduction of Denise Huskins (second from right with her mother and two brothers) are demanding police apologize for calling the incident a hoax. In an email to the San Francisco Chronicle, the group threatens the Vallejo Police Department anbd spokesman Lt. Kenny Park (above) that they will 'cause harm' if Huskins faces criminal charges. They also say they monitored Huskins' boyfriend Aaron Quinn (above) after the kidnapping so he would not go to police, which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours. In an email the kidnappers write; 'I/we may be the direct agent of harm. But it will be made crystal clear that the Vallejo Police Department, and you, Mr. [Kenny] Park, had every opportunity to stop it.' Last week Lt. Park, the spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, said that the kidnapping of Huskins, which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers, 40 detectives and numerous FBI agents, was \u00a0an 'orchestrated event.' The letter to the\u00a0Chronicle\u00a0says authorities have until noon on Tuesday to apologize. It also demands that the police make clear that neither Huskins or her boyfriend Aaron Quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges. As for the main reason behind the kidnapping, they write; 'The Mare Island kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets.' They then compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11, the famous caper film that starred members of the Rat Pack when it premiered in 1960 and Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney in the 2001 remake. It is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either, also reaching out to them on March 24 with an audio file of Huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in Mare Island. She  eventually turned up in Huntington Beach, where both of her parents live, just a few hours later. This latest email, sent on Saturday from a dummy account, was 9,000 words long, and detailed why the group kidnapped Huskins, and how they went about taking her from her home. The group consists of three members, two with college educations, and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area. They claim they drilled holes in the window of Huskins and Quinn's home to gain entry, and then used squirt guns with'strobe flashlights and laser pointers' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms. They say they played 'calming music' as they went about the abduction, and put monitors on Quinn, 30, so they could make sure he did not go to police. They then say they put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's car and drove off with her. The group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of Huskins and Quinn's home (above) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take Huskins. The kidnapping, which has been called an 'orchestrated event' by authorities, has drawn comparisons to the film Gone Girl (above) In the end however, they claim it was a case of mistaken identity, and they did not mean to take Huskins, thinking that someone else would be in the house. They say that is why they decided to drop her off in Huntington Beach and that they were 'horrified at what we had done.' As for the ransom they requested, what police believe to be a rather paltry $8,500, the group said; 'We chose $8,500 because it was below the $10,000 reporting threshold, and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law.' Attorneys for both Quinn and Huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email, and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth.

{"article": "Last words: Kelly Gissendaner, 46, recorded a last message before her execution was canceled. The only woman on Georgia's death row told her children that 'love beats out hate' just 90 minutes before she was due to be executed on Monday night. Kelly Gissendaner, 46, had been taken to the prison in Jackson where Georgia carries out executions by lethal injection, and expected to die that night - before officials discovered a problem with the drug that was meant to kill her. Executioners for the state found that their dose of pentobarbital, a clear solution solution they were going to use on Gissendaner, was cloudy, sparking fears that it would not work properly. The Georgia Department of Corrections first delayed the execution, scheduled for 7pm, then eventually canceled it at 11pm 'out of an abundance of caution'. But when she recorded her statement, addressed to her children and legal team, she would have had no idea that she was not minutes from death. A recording of the statement, obtained from prison officials by NBC News, revealed that she told her children, whose father she helped murder, to 'keep strong' in the wake of her death. Speaking in a thick Southern accent, she said: 'I just want to tell my kids I love them and I'm proud of them. 'And no matter what happens tonight, love does beat out hate. You keep strong and keep your heads up. I love you.' Scroll down to hear her last words. Victim: Douglas Gissendaner, pictured above, was killed by her lover, Greg Owen, who stabbed him repeatedly. His wife was convicted of his murder for her role in persuading Owen. He is pictured with two of her children, to whom Gissendaner addressed her last words. She also left a message for her legal team, who had made repeated appeals for clemency from state authorities and the Supreme Court - all of which were denied. She said: 'I want to tell my lawyers thank you for all they've done. No matter what happens I know you've done your best and I love you all.' As well as making her last statement, Gissendaner had also been fed the enormous last meal she requested, which included two Burger King cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, lemonade, popcorn and a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that she had eaten the meal by the time she recorded her statement, and was likely just a few feet away from the death chamber. Gissendaner had come within hours of death before. She was originally due to be executed in late February, but officials called it off because of forecast snow. Prisoners: Gissendaner's lover Greg Owen, left, was the one who stabbed Douglas Gissandaner to death and is serving life in prison. Gissendaner herself did not kill her husband, but persuaded Owen to - for which she was sentenced to die. Doing time: Gissendaner, pictured in 2004, has been on death row for 17 years. Her execution has been postponed twice. She had spent the previous 17 years in prison waiting to die, after being convicted of murdering her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, despite not having physically killed him.

In her trial, prosecutors told how she repeatedly pushed Owen to kill her husband. He then ambushed him, forced him to drive to a remote area and stabbed him multiple times. Owen and Gissendaner then met up and set fire to the dead man's car. Owen, who eventually confessed and testified against his former girlfriend, is serving a life prison sentence and is eligible for parole in eight years. Gissendanger's execution is one of two postponed by concerns over the drug - though officials have said it would have been strong enough to end her life. In a statement reported by the\u00a0Gwinnett Daily Post, a spokesman said: 'The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits. Feet from death: Gissendaner was in the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson when she recorded her message. 'Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the execution team performed the necessary checks. 'At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, inmate Gissendaner\u2019s execution has been postponed.' The corrections department has yet to say to which date the execution will be rescheduled. Many have called for Gissendaner to be spared the death penalty and given life in prison instead - including her children.

{"article": "Paying a player northwards of \u00a3100,000 a week to be an occasional impact sub off the bench is an expensive business, even for a side who have Premier League title aspirations. And, judging by Arsene Wenger\u2019s decision to leave him sat in his tracksuit throughout the entirety of the 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, Theo Walcott seems to have become just that at Arsenal. Indeed there was, for portions of this match, a sense that Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck could form a clinical strike force in the Premier League for years to come \u2013 while Walcott warmed up on the touchline. Yet, even in the second half when things were not going right for Arsenal and they needed a spark to reignite them, Wenger instead turned to Tomas Rosicky ahead of Walcott to give some added impetus. And, as much as Walcott will have enjoyed seeing his side keep the pressure up on second-placed Manchester City, you can\u2019t help but feel the England forward must be contemplating lowering his reported wage demands if he wants to stay at the Emirates. Theo Walcott has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over \u00a3100,000 a week. The England international was left on the bench for the game against Newcastle and didn't feature. Wojciech Szczesny and Walcott have both found their chances limited this for Arsenal this season. Because, put simply, where do you fit him into this Gunners side? Giroud is on fire and is leading the line superbly \u2013 he has scored 11 goals in 12 Premier League starts this season after his two at St James\u2019 \u2013 Welbeck caused problems all afternoon, contributing an assist for the first and he also should have netted at least twice, while Sanchez, although visibly tired, was still able to produce that little bit of magic to keep the Gunners on the front foot. Walcott is not an automatic selection anymore, and therefore he cannot be too ambitious with his wage demands. Arsenal\u2019s form is superb \u2013 they have won 14 of 16 games since New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 and they have achieved that largely without Walcott\u2019s presence. The 26-year-old \u2013 yes, he is really still that young \u2013 has started just three top-flight games all season after returning from injury, and the Gunners haven\u2019t exactly missed him. 2014/15 - All competitions. 11 appearances (5 starts), 3 goals. Overall - All competitions. 294 appearances (190 starts), 72 goals. Right now the Gunners are playing with pace and panache \u2013 displayed perfectly when Welbeck, Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey combined to take Arsenal from one side of the field to the other, only for Mike Williamson to make a timely interception. This was just one example of when Arsenal\u2019s front men wreaked havoc in an awesome first-half display. Yet, despite that, their goals at St James\u2019 Park came from a direct source. Giroud loves scoring against Newcastle anyway, and now has eight in seven against them, but the way he calmly kneed in his first after Welbeck\u2019s flick-on highlights a player with confidence. His second was also a decent header, although he didn\u2019t even have to jump off the ground so feeble was the challenge offered up by Williamson. Unfortunately for Walcott, height and an aerial presence will make Giroud first-choice centre forward every time. Alexis Sanchez (left) has been a revelation since signing for the club from Barcelona in the summer. Oliver Giroud (12) scored an impressive double at St James' Park to continue his excellent form. Despite returning from a serious injury, Walcott has struggled to earn a place in Wenger's starting 11. Welbeck offers an abundance of pace and energy and can play anywhere across the front three, while Sanchez on his day is simply world class. They may not have been at their absolute best against Newcastle, but they got the job done. But on saying all of that, if Wenger does not offer Walcott a new deal then he risks losing a player with more than 200 games\u2019 worth of Premier League experience and 47 strikes in England\u2019s top flight to one of his rivals. Is he really willing to risk that? Perhaps though, given Walcott\u2019s shocking injury record, Wenger thinks he has replaced one \u2018W\u2019 for another \u2013 with the \u00a316million acquisition of Welbeck increasingly looking like a piece of shrewd business by the Frenchman. Will Walcott or Wenger blink first in this latest of many contract disputes the England winger seems to have had with the club? On the basis of Saturday\u2019s match, you get the impression the England striker may be knocking on the manager\u2019s door with his tail between his legs sometime soon. Danny Welbeck (right) terrorised the Newcastle defence with his pace and looks to be settling in well.", "abstract": "Theo Walcott's future at Arsenal is uncertain as he has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over \u00a3100,000 a week.

{"article": "One in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in, with more than \u00a312 billion needed to sort out repairs, a new study has revealed. Emergency funding by the Government after last year's floods helped drive a 33% increase in pothole repairs, but there has been no reduction in the amount needed to bring the network in England and Wales up to scratch, said a report. The Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) said \u00a312.16billion was needed to get the local road network back into'reasonable' condition, adding that money spent on filling 2.7 million potholes in the past year had been 'wasted'. The estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years, said the report. One in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in, with more than \u00a312 billion needed to sort out repairs, a new study has revealed. The annual survey also found a 'dramatic' increase in the amount paid in compensation to motorists in England, doubling to more than \u00a320 million outside London. The staffing costs to local authorities for processing claims increased to almost \u00a318 million, equivalent to 225 hours per month per authority, it was found. Alan Mackenzie, chairman of the AIA, said: 'The Government's emergency funding for pothole and flood repair following last year's wet winter has clearly contributed to the trends reported in this year's survey. 'Essentially, the money spent on filling the 2.7 million potholes reported is wasted - it is inefficient and short term in its effectiveness. 'So, while we understand that the Department for Transport is promoting permanent repairs, the point remains that money would be better spent preventing potholes forming in the first place. 'The \u00a36 billion of funding pledged between 2015 and 2021 is welcome, and hopefully will be confirmed by an incoming government. But the truth is that although it sounds like a big investment, it will only be enough for local authorities to tread water and it will do nothing to tackle the backlog or prevent continuing deterioration.' Peter Box, transport spokesman at the Local Government Association, said: 'Councils fixed more potholes than ever before last year - one every 15 seconds - despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts. The estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years, a new report claims. 'It is hugely frustrating yet unsurprising that, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to make a dent in the \u00a312 billion roads repair backlog. Patching up our crumbling road network is simply not the answer to tackle the roads crisis we face as a country. 'Councils need billions, not millions, to bring our roads up to scratch. Every mile of motorways and trunk roads will receive \u00a31.4 million funding over the next six years compared with \u00a331,000 per mile for local roads. This makes little sense given the Government's own traffic projections predict an increase in local traffic of more than 40% by 2040.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Back in 2010 the top transport priority amongst voters was filling in the potholes. Five years later and an RAC Foundation poll shows fixing our roads and pavements remains the public's number one concern. 'The extra chunks of cash spent on road maintenance over the last parliament have been welcome but with a record number of cars on the road, rising traffic volume and routine resurfacing work taking place only half as frequently as in the 1980s, this issue is unlikely to slip far down the list of things people want ministers to tackle.'", "abstract": "A new study has revealed that one in six roads in England and Wales are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in, with over \u00a312bn needed to sort out repairs.

{"article": "Peter Lawwell called it the \u2018Le Guen hump\u2019 and for certain Celtic players the chief executive\u2019s words might be tweaked to read \u2018taking the hump\u2019. It\u2019s to his credit that, with typical candour, Kris Commons admits he had teething problems with the regime change that saw Ronny Deila walk into Celtic intent on wholesale reform. Lawwell knew that by appointing the Norwegian in the wake of Neil Lennon\u2019s resignation he was taking a risk, and recently likened the gamble to Rangers\u2019 decision to install Paul Le Guen in 2006. After a difficult start, Kris Commons has now build a strong relationship with Celtic manager Ronny Deila. The Frenchman lasted barely six months at Ibrox and departed in the wake of a dressing-room revolt. Yet, while the likes of Kris Boyd and Barry Ferguson actively railed against Le Guen\u2019s methods, the resistance to Deila\u2019s changes was more subtle. There was, however, bemusement that the club should seek to change the winning formula that had seen Lennon land three titles in a row alongside consecutive qualifications for the Champions League group stage. Having clinched the major Player of the Year honours and scored 32 times last season, Commons more than most was perhaps entitled to feel his game had little need for refinement. He readily admits to feeling unsettled by the changes that saw the former Stromsgodset chief place a greater emphasis on fitness as he attempted to realise a high-tempo pressing game. As with most human squabbles, communication has proved the key to a solution. Deila\u2019s policy of regularly sitting down to speak individually with his players has given Commons a right of reply and he has used it, returning to first-team prominence and signing a new contract last month. Commons has adapted well to the manager's demands of his players to be physically fitter than before. Commons is likely to start the League Cup Final and has declared himself all in as Deila bids to win his first trophy as Celtic manager. \u2018It is always difficult when you feel like you\u2019ve come off a season doing really well then someone comes in and wants to change things, as he sees it, for the better,\u2019 he said. \u2018But through that transitional period we got knocked out the Champions League and didn\u2019t get off to a great start in the league. It had an effect on the park. \u2018I wasn\u2019t playing every week and, when I was in, I\u2019d try to do the things the manager wanted. In recent weeks, when I have been fit and healthy, I\u2019ve felt like a different player and added more to my game than usual. \u2018We speak one-to-one on a regular basis about what he wants and what I want. He\u2019s good that way, super. He\u2019s not telling me anything I don\u2019t know already, it\u2019s just sometimes you need a push in the right direction to make you a better player.\u2019 Bright, articulate and possessed with a healthy sense of his own ability, Commons is one of the bigger characters in the dressing room and it was always crucial that Deila found a way to bring the Mansfield-born attacking midfielder on side. Even Lennon had a rocky spell with Commons during the player\u2019s first full season at the club but the pair went on to forge a productive working relationship to the extent that the Northern Irishman admitted he would happily take Commons off Deila\u2019s hands as he settled into his new job at Bolton. Commons talks with captain Scott Brown in training ahead of the Scottish League cup final on Sunday. A return to the Championship, where the 31-year-old had performed comfortably and without the incessant pressure to win inherent at Celtic, would have been an easier and possibly more lucrative option. \u2018I\u2019m not looking for an easy way out,\u2019 he contends. \u2018I wasn\u2019t looking just to plod away through these next two or three years. I have a lot of goals for myself \u2014 to win more trophies, more cups. I want to win a Treble and play in the Champions League these next couple of years. I\u2019ve not signed a deal where I think: \u201cOh, that\u2019s great, I can get my feet up\u201d. \u2018The manager will put pressure on me to keep improving, so I\u2019ve got to show signs of doing that and that\u2019s one of my goals \u2014 I want to get better as a player as I get older.\u2019 Commons admits he is \u2018three to four kilos\u2019 lighter thanks to Deila\u2019s demands that his players cut their body fat and admits he feels fitter as a result.

{"article": "AIDS came from gorillas as well as chimpanzees, new research\u00a0suggests. Two of the four known groups of viruses that cause the disease have been traced back to the great apes that share about 98 per cent of their DNA with humans. It had been known simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) - the monkey equivalent of HIV - had jumped from chimpanzees into humans, but now it seems gorillas in Cameroon also played a vital role. Scientists say understanding the disease's origins will help predict the future risk of an outbreak. Scientists have discovered that AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon, as well as groups of chimpanzees in the country. The connection was uncovered after researchers analysed faecal samples collected in remote forests. They found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. HIV-1 - the virus that causes AIDS - has jumped species to infect humans on at least four separate occasions. The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon. Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is pictured. Groups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon. But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa. The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s. For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps. This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908. Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered. The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo. After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said. They identified it in four communities of western lowland gorillas in southern Cameroon - and dubbed it 'SIVgor'. Professor Beatrice Hahn, of Pennsylvania University, said: 'Viral sequencing revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among the different gorilla samples. 'Two of the gorilla virus lineages were particularly closely related to HIV-1 groups O and P. This told us these two groups originated in western lowland gorillas.' Dr Martine Peeters, of Montpelier University in France, said the study has implications for understanding emerging diseases and gauging future human infection risks. She added: 'From this study and others our team has conducted in the past it has become clear both chimpanzees and gorillas harbour viruses capable of crossing the species barrier to humans and have the potential to cause major disease outbreaks.' The origin of HIV has baffled scientists since 1984 when it was first shown it causes AIDS. Evidence soon pointed to Africa and a similar virus in chimpanzees. Many scientists suspect that the chimp virus jumped into humans who hunt and butcher these great apes. But gorillas are now emerging as having played a supporting role in the AIDS epidemic - possibly by humans hunting them. The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "abstract": "New research suggests that AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon, as well as groups of chimpanzees in the country.

She told the magazine: 'I definitely strive to be a low-maintenance model. Some girls have their hair and make-up artist arrive five hours before an event, but I aim to do it in two hours max - I'm not trying to wake up at 7am for a 7pm event.' The blessing of having the metabolism of a teenager means that she usually doesn't even bother to step up her exercise regime ahead of a fashion photo shoot. Gigi at the Oscars Vanity Fair After Party in LA last month. She said: 'If I did I would never get to have a burger or take a day off from the gym for a movie marathon, which would not be cool. I do step up my regime before a Sports Illustrated shoot or if I'm shooting lingerie. And a couple of weeks\u00a0before a fashion show, I'll eat more healthily and make sure I'm in the gym at least once a day boxing.'

{"article": "The proposed \u00a316million fee that Fiorentina will pay Chelsea to sign Mohamed Salah on a permanent deal in the summer of 2016 is beginning to look like daylight robbery. The 22-year-old condemned Juventus to their first home defeat in 48 matches with his sixth goal in seven games after being allowed to leave Stamford Bridge on loan in February. Salah was used as a bargaining tool for Juan Cuadrado to go in the opposite direction for \u00a323.3m, rising to \u00a327m with bonuses, but has been the more devastating of the two for their new clubs. 'Are you listening, Jose?' Mourinho allowed Mohamed Salah to leave Chelsea on loan to Fiorentina. The front pages of Italian newspapers were dominated by Salah after his two goals against Juventus. Mohamed Salah. 7 games. 6 goals. Juan Cuadrado. 5 games. 0 goals. Salah did not suit Jose Mourinho's style of play and made just two starts in 2014-15. He averaged nine minutes per game between August and January, and the arrival of Cuadrado saw him further kicked to the curb. Mourinho and Salah agreed it was best he get first-team opportunities elsewhere, and Fiorentina's faith has been rewarded. Against Juventus he sent a message to Chelsea by starting a run from his own half in a lethal counter-attack. He outpaced Simone Padoin before beating goalkeeper Marco Storari in the top left corner to make it 1-0 in the 11th minute. Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba were on the same wavelength when they tweeted Salah is 'on fire' and the Egyptian, four years younger than Cuadrado, has plenty of time to improve. Salah opens the scoring with after a superb solo run from his own half against Juventus. The Egypt international salutes the crowd after scoring against Serie A champions Juventus. Salah (right) spent most of his time at Chelsea on the substitutes' bench under manager Jose Mourinho. BASLE: 67 appearances, 13 goals. CHELSEA: 19 appearances, two goals. FIORENTINA:\u00a0Seven appearances, six goals. EGYPT: 35 appearances, 20 goals. On his arrival, Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella announced Salah would have to 'adapt to our football' and that 'this is a league that's different from the Swiss and the English'. Louis van Gaal admitted it could take a year for Manchester United's signings to develop, but no such time frame has been required for Salah. Any suggestion he could not perform against Barclays Premier League teams was dismissed on March 1 when he punished Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League with a quick-witted one-two. And three days later he scored the winner against Inter Milan at the San Siro to earn Fiorentina's first win in that fixture since May 2000. All this has helped Fiorentina stretch their unbeaten run to 13 games as the man behind Hazard, Willian, Oscar and Cuadrado in the pecking order gets put to good use elsewhere.

{"article": "(CNN)There is plenty of noise surrounding the nuclear deal that is being negotiated with Iran. But for all the heat generated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress and an ill-conceived, panicky letter to Iran's leadership organized by Sen.Tom Cotton -- the latest debate is creating little light. Indeed, it may actually be obscuring the fundamental issue of Iran's own foreign policies -- and whether Tehran's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all. Unfortunately, few in Congress have taken the time to consider the matter in a thoughtful, coherent manner. There are, of course, certain realities that should not be in dispute: Yes, Iran is a regional adversary to a number of its Gulf neighbors and Israel. And it does aim to provoke Sunni-led Gulf states and generally to sow seeds of sectarian Islam abroad. In addition, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp's Quds force is alleged to have provided training and weapons to a range of militants -- Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen, disenfranchised Shia Muslims in Bahrain, and even to militant groups in West Africa. Most recently, Iran has been directing military operations by U.S.-equipped Iraqi forces against ISIS militants in Iraq, forces that have been aided by U.S. airstrikes. Netanyahu grasped the irony, starkly warning \"when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.\" (Although Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be confused, insisting at a March 11 hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran must be unhappy with U.S. airstrikes against ISIS). Yet the question that Netanyahu did not answer, and which Sen. Cotton and his 46 colleagues have not even asked, is what exactly should be done about Iran's activities abroad? Many in Congress fail to grasp that Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and his colleagues in Iran's Cabinet, with their U.S.-PhDs and understanding of plural democracies, are not cut from the same cloth as the hardliners in charge of Iran's Quds force (its commander, Qasem Suleimani turns up in Lebanon and Iraq despite a travel and asset ban).  And yes, it was the Quds force that provided the explosives and operatives that led to significant U.S. casualties in the early years of the 2003 Iraq war. To answer the question of what to do about Iran's activities, it is important to understand that the nuclear agreement, while it has little to do with Iran's arms transfers or extracurricular activities in the region, can lay the groundwork for a far more serious engagement about Iran's role in the region -- and in a manner that addresses head-on the concerns of its Sunni neighbors, many of whom are eager to resume longstanding trading relationships with Iran. The reality is that Iran's reemergence into the international community in a postnuclear deal environment would allow the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to assert its interests in the region, and to lay out expectations of Iran as a constructive partner. It might even lead to quiet, back-channel diplomacy about the future of Syria without al-Assad. None of this is possible in the absence of the nuclear deal. Once Iran begins to navigate its relationships as more than the isolated, nuclear-threshold pariah state it currently is, there will be less tolerance internationally for destabilizing arms transfers and the training of would-be insurgents. And there is no need to rely on Iran's word that it will refrain from such activities. As U.N. Security Council resolutions are rewritten to lift the ban on uranium enrichment in Iran, the ban on Iranian arms transfers can and should remain in place, with U.N. member states required to report to the Security Council any violations of that ban by Iran. Ultimately, as important as the nuclear issue is, the real promise of a deal is only partially about limiting the country's nuclear ambitions -- it is also about returning stability to a shattered region, exhausted and impoverished by war. Iran, the United States and Gulf allies can be partners in such a process with clear eyes and no illusions about how difficult it will be. A nuclear deal is just the beginning.", "abstract": "The debate surrounding the nuclear deal with Iran is obscuring the fundamental issue of Iran's foreign policies and whether Tehran's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all.

{"article": "With mile upon mile of untouched golden beaches, corals reefs ripe for divers, ancient artifacts and a population desperate to impress. Somaliland is a country with plenty to offer tourists and it is actively encouraging visitors. But unfortunately, the much-desired tourists are not flocking to the east African outpost, neighbouring Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. For starters, the country doesn't exist at all according to the international community, which recognises it only as part of Somalia, the troubled nation where piracy is rife and terrorist organisation Al-Shabaab is based. Locals walk along some of the 528 miles of beachfront in Somaliland that the country is keen to promote. Although not officially recognised as a country, Somaliland neighbours Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia. This association with Somalia is the reason western governments such as the UK and Canada call the self-proclaimed independent entity and former British protectorate a no-go zone, claim locals, but this isn't stopping Somaliland pushing to bring in the tourist dollar. Official websites proudly proclaim they boast 850km (528 miles) of quiet beaches just waiting to be lazed upon by westerners, while historic landmarks await their long-overdue admiration. But the tourists are not flooding in, despite there being numerous means of accessing the nation through neighbouring Ethiopia and Djibouti. As far as Somaliland is concerned, the country has been independent since 1991 and the only thing holding it back is the fact that isn't being recognised globally. Abdinasir Ibrahim is the director of Somaliland Travel & Tours Agency,  is keen to add to the handful of eager travellers who defy warnings to visit. He laments the slow increase in tourists over recent years - figures differ greatly from a few hundred to more than 1000 last year - due to the 'lack of recognition,' referring to the wait for the world to acknowledge Somaliland's existence. 'I believe that as soon we get international recognition the tourists will flock to our stunning beaches.' he tells MailOnline. The unofficial nation gained independence from Britain in 1960 before joining the former Italian Somaliland but the countries encountered strife under the rule of dictator Mohammad Siad Barre, whose regime killed tens of thousands of Somalilanders due to tribal connection during a brutal civil war from 1988.\u00a0When the Barre regime fell in 1991, Somaliland declared their still unrecognised independence. An unspoiled stretch of sand in Somaliland which tourism bodies are keen for westerners to explore. Tourists are welcome in the unrecognised country, but are asked to respect local customs and dress modestly. Boats stationed off the coast of Berbera, the harbour city Somaliland has long relied on for its economy. While not great in numbers, tourists do come. Mostly from the UK, USA, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Germany, says Abdinasir, who insists Somaliland has something to offer all sorts of travellers, not just those keen to get a genuinely unique stamp on their passport. 'We have something to offer for all kind of tourists,' he says. 'Somaliland have an 850 km coastline with lots of pristine beaches, beautiful coral reefs, unique archaeological sites, rare birds and mammals, fabulous mountain ranges, and a year-round sunny, warm climate, so we are offering a wide variety of tour opportunities that will allow everyone to experience Somaliland in ways that are unique.' While Foreign and Commonwealth Office warnings place the former British protectorate with Somalia in the red zone advising against all travel, most experts say the democratically government Islamic country is among the safest and most peaceful in its region. Abdinasir says emphatically that any perception that Somaliland is dangerous is 'wrong'. 'That\u2019s actually the saddest part, Somaliland has a 0 per cent foreigners/tourists crime rate for the last 10 years,' he claims. A woman sits among her scales awaiting her next sale of vegetables in the market in Hargeisa,\u00a0a city in the northwestern Woqooyi Galbeed province.

'It seems that when you are doing things peacefully and helping yourself, then no one cares about you,' the acting Somaliland ambassador to Ethiopia, Ayanle Salad Deria, told Al Jazeera. 'Somaliland has been functioning for 24 years, and we've got lots of places to visit, including 850 kilometers (528 miles) of beaches.' The range of figures for incoming tourists in 2014 is warped by some numbers including just foreign tourists while other records include those who had previously fled violence slowly returning.

{"article": "Despite flying through the air at high-speeds, researchers have discovered that bats avoid mishaps because they have their own set of \u2018traffic rules' when hunting for food. Somerset Daubenton\u2019s bats, in particular, chase each other, perform tandem turns and can even slow down without ever hitting each other. And now researchers have found this is down to the way they take part in 'formation flying'. Researchers from Bristol University measured biosonar bat calls to calculate what members of group perceived as they foraged for food. It found the bats interact by swapping between leading and following, and they swap these roles by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier. Dr Marc Holderied, of the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, studied pairs of Daubenton\u2019s bats foraging low over water for stranded insects at a site near the village of Barrow Gurney, in Somerset. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, Dr Holderied was able to accurately measure the biosonar calls of the interacting bats and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. The researchers found that the winged mammal uses one simple trick to create their interactive behaviours - they swap who is taking a leading role and who is following. They swap these leader-follower roles and perform chases or co-ordinated manoeuvres by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier. The experts studied Daubenton's bats (pictured). They said: 'The bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo [and] copy this individual\u2019s flight direction. The discovery could help improve search and rescue missions and surveillance operations. This almost as fast as the blink of a human eye, which as been measured at between 300 to 400 milliseconds. Dr Holderied said: 'The bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual\u2019s flight direction within four to five of your own wingbeats.' And his team said the discovery could have wider implications - helping improve search and rescue missions and surveillance operations. The study was published in Plos Computation Biology. The robotic wings are made using carbon fibre and, similar to the wing of a bird, each have a wrist joint custom built using a 3D printer. Inspired by the way bats and birds avoid colliding in mid-air, roboticists have created flying drones with'morphing wings'. The robotic wings are made using carbon fibre and, similar to the wing of a bird, each have a wrist joint custom built using a 3D printer. These joints are hinged in such a way so that as the rest of the wing flaps, the hand can freely fold and unfold over the arm, much like origami folding, without any actuation. In particular the pin joint connects the arm wing and the hand wing. The arm wing attaches to the body of the robot at the shoulder joint, which initiates the flapping. And the complete wing set has a wingspan of 15.7 inches (40cm) with a length, or chord, of three inches (80 mm). In addition to morphing shape to avoid collisions, the mechanism could also allow future flying robots to easily squeeze between obstacles, such as branches of a tree, and fully recover after accidental hard impacts. The morphing technology was built by experts from Stanford University.", "abstract": "Researchers from Bristol University have discovered that bats avoid collisions while hunting for food by following their own set of 'traffic rules'.

{"article": "(CNN)In \"Game of Thrones,\" Yunkai might be a fictional city ruled by an oligarchy of slave merchants, but the scenes had to be filmed in the real world. The citadel of Ait-Ben-Haddou in Morocco near Ouarzazate (pronounced Wa-za-zat) was chosen as the location, and is one of the most popular film-making destinations in the region. And scenes set in the ancient city of Astapor, which was a big part of the final episode of season three, was filmed in Essaouira -- also in Morocco. But the creators of \"Game of Thrones\" were not the first to use the region's beauty as the backdrop for a major international production. More than a decade before them, Ridley Scott chose the North African country to film the gory glory of ancient Rome in his epic \"Gladiator\" starring Russell Crowe. And so did the producers of \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" which starred Jake Gyllenhaal. Indeed, big foreign productions seeking a Middle Eastern backdrop (and possibly an academy award) have long chosen Morocco for its relatively cheap price tag and safety -- and nearly half of the films shot in the kingdom are made in Ouarzazate. According to Amine Tazi, who runs two of the town's biggest studios, foreign directors come for the dramatic light as well as the wide variety of landscapes. But Morocco's appeal goes far beyond the beautiful vistas. Filmmakers can find experienced local crews that help productions save half the cost they'd pay in Europe or the U.S. \"Logistically, [Ouarzazate is] very good,\" says Tazi, general manager at Atlas & CLA Studios. \"Everything is very close by. Hotels are close by. People are very movie friendly and very efficient.\" Tazi's studios also offer dozens of set options -- from Styrofoam Egyptian temples to plaster-cast Tibetan Palaces. National Geographic used one of his sets in the mini-series \"Killing Jesus\" -- the seven-week production was filmed by a crew of 250 people and included 4,500 extras. Bargain Hunting. Atlas Studios opened in 1983 to host the Michael Douglas classic \"The Jewel of the Nile.\"  Since then, around 200 TV shows and films have been shot there, including \"Babel,\" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. \"Morocco is one of the countries that goes out of its way to welcome film makers,\" says Tony Reeves, writer of the Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations. \"Technical crews in Morocco are well sought after -- builders, painters, extras, electrical resources.\" But in recent years productions have been hit by the global financial crisis and the uncertainty following the Arab Spring which ripped through North Africa. Between 2008 and 2013, Tazi's revenue dropped by 50%. Such a slowdown hit Ouarzazate'seconomy, where many of the 100,000 citizens rely on the cinema industry from employment. \"The city is poor. There [are] few job opportunities,\" says resident Abdelaziz Bouydnayen, who once played Osama Bin Laden in a National Geographic  documentary. \"We are all just waiting...There are millions of dollars that come into this city, but the city is still poor.\" In the past decade, both of the town's theaters have closed leaving residents without a place to watch the films shot in their back yard. Changing Times. Yet, a series of recent developments have started to show the start of a revival. Last year, 22 films used Tazi's studios -- up from 12 in 2013. Foreign film projects spent $120 million in 2014, according to the country's film commission  -- up from $23 million the previous year. And part of the reason filmmakers keep coming to Morocco are the tax-incentives -- foreign crews are exempt from paying value added tax. But the other reason is the experience of Moroccan talent. \"Making stories of biblical proportions requires that there be casts of hundreds\" says Roma Downey, who is producing the upcoming TV series \"A.D.\" in Morocco. \"To wrangle that many people and have them be so focused and understand what they're doing is a big part of what they're doing.  It save time, saves money.\" Tazi is so confident that the current boom will continue that he plans to build a brand new Roman-themed set this year. He's hoping to keep the cameras rolling and action going in Morocco's Hollywood. More from Marketplace Africa. Read this: Teenager brings poop power to Kenyan school.

Scroll down for video. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured above with Prince George and their spaniel Lupo, \u00a0have placed a classified advert in The Lady for a housekeeper at their country home. The housekeeper will be based as the couple's Norfolk home Anmer Hall and the advert states that 'discretion and loyalty' will be paramount for the successful applicant. Now it seems that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have resorted to placing an advert for a new housekeeper at their country home, Anmer Hall, in the pages of the illustrious magazine. According to well-placed sources, the notice that appeared on the magazine\u2019s online home page yesterday - and will today appear in print - seeking an \u2018experienced housekeeper for a large family home in Norfolk\u2019 is for the latest addition to William and Kate\u2019s expanding domestic staff. The advert, which would have cost around \u00a3575 plus VAT to place, makes clear that they are looking for someone who is well versed in dealing with young children \u2013 as well as Prince George, who will turn two in July, the couple\u2019s second baby is due later next month \u2013 and their excitable spaniel, Lupo. It reads: \u2018Housekeeper sought for a large family home in Norfolk. We are looking for someone with previous housekeeping experience, ideally within a large private house, and preferably within a family environment with dogs.\u2019 It says the successful applicant\u2019s main duties will include: \u2018cleaning all areas of the house to a high standard; caring for and maintaining the home owners\u2019 clothing; cleaning silverware and glassware; purchasing groceries and general provisions for the house; and dealing with deliveries; assisting with childcare and caring for dogs.\u2019 Unsurprisingly, the Cambridges are looking for someone who can fit into a royal household. \u2018Discretion and loyalty is paramount,\u2019 the advert reads, in addition to a valid UK driving licence.

The couple appear to have had some trouble in finding the right person to oversee their new ten-bedroom home on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate and was given to them by the monarch as a wedding present. William and Kate have spent a small fortune renovating the Georgian pile to their exact taste \u2013 including the building of a new garden room with a glass ceiling so they can dine under the stars. The house already has its own swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. The royal couple plan to move to Norfolk full time after their second child is born next month. Prince George, pictured above, is set to turn two in July. They had employed two of the Queen\u2019s trusted employees, Amy Wood and her husband, Colin, to work at the mansion as housekeeper and gardener.

Two teenagers convicted of sexually assaulting an elderly woman (above, the elderly woman named as Jane Doe during the sentencing on Friday) and then pouring bleach down her throat after breaking into her Southern California home have been sentenced to 30 years in prison. The 87-year-old woman told Raymond Miranda (above), 15, and Ruben Melanson, 16, in court on Friday that they terrorized her as they were sentenced as adults for the crime that occurred last April. The boys (both Miranda and Melanson pictured during court on Friday) will remain in custody of the California Department of Juvenile Justice until they turn 18 years old before being transferred to a state prison. The teenagers pleaded guilty to several charges including robbery last year after forcing their way into the apartment of Doe, a resident at the gated Camelot Retirement Community in Hemet. Miranda and Melanson, who were aged 14 and 15 at the time of the incident, also admitted to rape, elderly abuse and a gang enhancement during the April 17, 2014 attack, according to the Los Angeles Times. Prosecutor Sean Crandell from the Riverside District Attorney's Office said it was one of the worst cases he has worked on during his 17-year career. Both boys were charged with burglary, elder abuse with great bodily injury, sexual penetration with a foreign object by force and rape, according to the\u00a0Press Enterprise. The teenagers reportedly crawled through a window of the woman's home while she was asleep, tied her up, sexually assaulted and beat her using knives and bottles, and poured two bottles of bleach over her body and down her throat, according to prosecutors.

{"article": "Doctors warned that taking the contraceptive Pill triples the risk of developing an incurable disease of the digestive system. Taking the contraceptive Pill triples the risk of developing an incurable disease of the digestive system, doctors warned last night. Cases of Crohn\u2019s disease have exploded since the 1960s, and researchers now believe widespread use of the Pill may be one of the main reasons behind the dramatic rise. They have found sex hormones in contraceptive Pills can weaken the gut, creating the perfect conditions for Crohn\u2019s to develop. The doctors also fear that repeated use of the \u2018morning-after pill\u2019 \u2013 which contains even higher doses of sex hormones than the daily tablet \u2013 might make women still more prone to it. Crohn\u2019s involves the painful inflammation of the digestive system, most commonly the intestines. This makes digesting food difficult, resulting in diarrhoea, fatigue and anaemia. Flare-ups can be so bad that working is impossible, leading to lengthy periods off work. Drugs and surgery can help ease symptoms, but there is no cure, and some sufferers find it so intolerable that they commit suicide. At least two Britons with Crohn\u2019s have travelled to Switzerland to end their lives at the controversial Dignitas clinic. Dr Hamed Khalili, a Harvard gastroenterologist, said Crohn\u2019s cases had risen \u2018two or three-fold\u2019 in the past 50 years, since widespread use of the Pill began. It now affects an estimated 100,000 people in Britain \u2013 one in every 650 people \u2013 although only a fraction of these are officially diagnosed. Changing diets had been touted as a reason for the increase, but Dr Khalili said research into the suspected link had been \u2018fairly disappointing\u2019. However, a study of 230,000 American women led by Dr Khalili found the risk was three times higher in women who had used the Pill for five years or more than those who had never been on it. A British study came to a similar conclusion. Exactly why the Pill \u2013 taken by around 3.5 million women in Britain, a third of those of childbearing age \u2013 seems to raise the risk of Crohn\u2019s remains unclear. But Dr Khalili said changing a woman\u2019s natural sex hormone levels appeared to do three things that could put them at greater risk: it made the gut lining more permeable, reduced levels of \u2018friendly\u2019 bacteria in the intestines and affected the immune system. He added he would expect the morning-after pill to increase the risk further, because it contained higher levels of hormones but said there was no hard data yet to back up that hypothesis. Overall, adult women are only a little more likely to have Crohn\u2019s than adult men. But twice as many women as men suffer from one of the main forms of Crohn\u2019s, where the colon is affected. Dr Khalili, who practises at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, stressed a woman was unlikely to get Crohn\u2019s simply by using the Pill, and that genetics played a large role. He said: \u2018What\u2019s very clear is that Crohn\u2019s is not caused by oral contraceptive use by itself. It\u2019s a combination of oral contraceptive use among individuals with a strong genetic predisposition to Crohn\u2019s. \u2018It\u2019s an interaction between these two that significantly increases the risk of an individual developing it.\u2019 Cases of Crohn\u2019s disease have exploded since the 1960s, and researchers now believe widespread use of the Pill may be one of the main reasons behind the dramatic rise. It was \u2018not far-fetched\u2019 to imagine that women will soon be warned not to go on the Pill if they carry certain high-risk genes, he said. Dr Khalili and his colleagues are now looking at this in a study of 1,500 women, a third of whom have Crohn\u2019s. Dr Simon Anderson, a consultant gastroenterologist at London Bridge hospital, said the Pill appeared to act as a \u2018trigger\u2019 to developing Crohn\u2019s. He cautioned: \u2018If you have a family history of Crohn\u2019s, I would advise against starting on the Pill.\u2019 But he said those without such a family history should not be unduly concerned. \u2018You are tripling the risk, but from a low base,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Crohn\u2019s is not a particularly common disease.\u2019 Crohn's disease is a painful condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system. Around one in 10,000 people are diagnosed every year with 115,000 current sufferers in the UK. Crohn's disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis. It is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition, and can cause redness", "abstract": "Taking the contraceptive pill triples the risk of developing Crohn's disease, an incurable disease of the digestive system, according to doctors.

A Labour parliamentary candidate has rejected a \u00a31,000 donation from Tony Blair towards her election campaign. Lesley Brennan, who is standing in Dundee East, said on Twitter her \u2018instinct\u2019 was to turn the offer down. The former Prime Minister has pledged \u00a3106,000 to help Labour campaigns in 106 marginal seats. But there has been unease about Mr Blair\u2019s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so-called \u2018blood money\u2019. Mr Miliband is under huge pressure from his Scottish MPs to rule out a deal with the nationalists. Yesterday his deputy Harriet Harman dodged the issue eight times on the Murnaghan show on Sky. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1. She said: \u2018We are focused on winning a Labour majority government. Let me say this. We do not want, we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the SNP.\u2019 Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan dodged the question four times on Pienaar\u2019s Politics on Radio 5 Live and shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran did so nine times on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics. On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could \u2018call the tune\u2019 in the Commons. \u2018It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,\u2019 he said. \u2018Neither are fit to govern. \u2018It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.\u2019 At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent. Labour MPs say the party has \u2018decided internally\u2019 not to rule out an SNP pact before the election. This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10. Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories\u2019 latest poster. Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk. The poster\u2019s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed \u2018Big Eck and Little Ed\u2019. The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV\u2019s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s.

{"article": "A fraudster escaped from one of Britain's most secure prisons by forging his own bail letter. Neil Moore duped wardens into believing he had been given bail by Southwark Crown Court before brazenly walking out of Wandsworth jail in south London where he was being held for a \u00a31.8million fraud. The 28-year-old employed 'extraordinary criminal inventiveness, deviousness and creativity' to secure his release from the Category B jail from which notorious Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs escaped in 1965. Neil Moore escaped from HMP Wandsworth - one of Britain's most secure prisons - by forging his own bail letter. Southwark Crown Court heard his plan included setting up an official-looking email address with the name of the detective in charge of the fraud probe involving British and American crime agencies. After escaping  Moore spent three days  securing a new driving licence - but handed himself back in after having a change of heart. Ian Paton, prosecuting, said: 'Having been remanded into custody by this court and realising the reality of what he had lent himself to and what was going to be uncovered, he promptly began adapting his skills for deceit, forgery and dishonesty and engaged them for his escape.' In spring last year Moore set about using a mobile phone illegally smuggled into HMP Wandsworth to organise his release. He set up an email domain imitating Her Majesty's Court Service that used hyphens instead of 'dots' to say Southwark Crown Court had rubber-stamped his bail on March 10, 2014. Moore managed to secure his release when staff failed to spot the subtle difference - despite Southwark being misspelled 'Southwalk'. Mr Paton said wardens discovered he had escaped when Moore's solicitor turned up for a meeting. He said: 'Mr Moore's solicitor had attended at HMP Wandsworth to have a conference with his client only to find that he had been \"granted bail\".' Southwark Crown Court heard the 28-year-old's plan included setting up an official-looking email address with the name of a detective involved in the fraud probe. With the help of the United States Department of Homeland Security they discovered Moore, who is originally from Trinidad and Tobago, had set up a website offshore. He used the name Chris Soole, a Scotland Yard Detective Inspector, to set up the domain. Mr Paton said: 'He promptly set in process the obtaining of real, genuine documentation in order to get a further identity. 'It was the first stage of securing documentation that could have secured his escape from the jurisdiction.' The court heard Moore, from Ilford, Essex,\u00a0had at least four different aliases and police were unsure of his precise identity. He pleaded guilty to escaping from lawful custody and eight counts of fraud. Moore posed as bank staff from Barclays, Lloyds and the Bank of America to fool large companies in the UK and US, including Thomas Exchange Global, into handing over around \u00a31,819,000 between February 2012 and November 2013. Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs escaped from the same prison in 1965. He utilised his talent of being able to impersonate female voices to dupe employees into believing they were talking to different callers. Mr Paton said: 'Much of this defendant's fraud consisted of him on a telephone speaking with a male voice and no less effectively and persuasively with a female voice.' His impersonations were so good his transgender civil partner became a fellow suspect in the fraud, the court heard. It took analysis by a top forensic voice expert to discount Kristen Moore, who was part-way through her reassignment at the height of the fraud. Moore often fooled firms into believing he was calling from their bank with concerns that their accounts may have been hijacked by criminals. He pretended to work for the fraud teams in the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of America and Bank of New York. After carefully researching the firms and banks he would convince his targets into handing over bank details or transfer funds into'safe' accounts that were under his control. Moore's elaborate deception finally began to unravel in July 2012 when he was arrested in a hire car in central London. He was quizzed about CCTV footage showing him withdrawing large sums of cash from banks in east London and large deposits from the firms he defrauded. Although his victims recouped the funds some were left so fearful of further frauds that they viewed investigators with suspicion, the court heard. Mr Paton said: 'Such was trauma that even when the officer visited them with his identification they still did not trust him. Even emails from the Metropolitan Police Service were viewed with suspicion.' Judge David Hunt adjourned the hearing until April 20 when he will hear mitigation.

Passengers, including two families with infant children, were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London. Traveller Amrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows, and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor. Photos show water trickling into the aisle (left) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess (right) The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: \u2018After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats. \u2018We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating. \u2018He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.\u2019 She added: \u2018It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as \u2026 the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.\u2019 Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks. Passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin. In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener. Amrita said: \u2018This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack. \u2018After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.\u2019 Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well. Passengers were forced to endure the stench for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London. She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology. She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways\u2019 frequent flyer club. She wasn\u2019t satisfied with the offer, saying: \u2018Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience.

'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.' Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks. Ms Jaurre said: \u2018Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin. \u2018I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.\u2019 She added: \u2018I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.\u2019 She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket. \u2018Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.\u2019", "abstract": "A woman is seeking compensation from Jet Airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight-hour flight from Delhi to London.

{"article": "Bryan Robson has paid Chris Smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Five years after signing for United, Smalling is yet to convince many United fans he and Phil Jones are suitable long-term replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers. The 25-year-old has been the object of a few taunts, most recently in the Manchester derby last November when he was sent off in the 39th minute. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (centre) has impressed Bryan Robson in recent weeks. Robson believes Smalling's passing has been 'crisper' during his displays against Arsenal and Newcastle. Smalling, already on a booking, showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down James Milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and United went on to lose 1-0 against a City team that was there for the taking. Smalling has since shown signs of improvement, though. His commanding performance in last week's 3-0 victory over Tottenham caught Robson's eye and the former United captain thinks that bodes well for Louis van Gaal ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. Robson said: 'Chris is a good defender. I have seen him improve over the last few games. 'I even thought against Arsenal and Newcastle away, his passing was a lot better, a lot crisper, so he has come on to a good game, he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at Liverpool.' Smalling kept 26-goal striker Harry Kane quiet last Sunday and the former Fulham man ventured forward, striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions. The end product was not good enough to suggest Van Gaal has a new Beckenbauer in his squad just yet, but Robson was so impressed by Smalling's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre-back to two United greats in Pallister and McGrath. Smalling kept a close eye on Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Manchester United's win against Spurs. The former lifted 10 trophies at United and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 FA Cup had he not fought a long-running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club. 'Paul McGrath could do that and so could Gary Pallister,' Robson said when invited to liken Smalling's display to a figure from the past. 'When you keep possession at the back sometimes it's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area. 'That means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and I thought Chris did that particularly well against Tottenham and that made it difficult for the Tottenham players.' Smalling seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Robson has compared Smalling to former Manchester United defender McGrath. Smalling has also been compared with Gary Pallister (left, pictured with Peter Schmeichel in 1996) 'It's a great feeling know that people are taking notice,' Smalling said. 'I am just hoping I can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results.' Smalling will have to be at his very best again on Sunday at Anfield. Van Gaal has warned the centre-back - and the rest of his team-mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture. As well as pride and bragging rights, a place in the top four is at stake. Liverpool have not lost since they fell 3-0 at Old Trafford in December and a victory for the hosts would move them above United into fourth for the first time since August. Robson thinks victory against Liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the Reds' top-four hopes and is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who trail City by just two points after their loss at Burnley last weekend. 'Yes, (second) is a realistic target,' the former United captain said. 'We have to play City and Arsenal at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good. 'When you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like Tottenham. 'And a win at Liverpool at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us.'

This team is devoted to hard work.' Balotelli joined Liverpool from Italian side AC Milan in the summer but has scored just once in the Premier League for Brendan Rodgers' side. The former Manchester City star has not featured for Italy since last summer's World Cup in Brazil. Balotelli shoots and scores during Italy's 2-1 victory over Germany in the semi-finals of Euro 2012 in Poland.", "abstract": "Leonardo Bonucci, a defender for Juventus and Italy, says that Mario Balotelli is still welcome in the Italy squad despite his poor form for Liverpool this season.

Above, Ford is pictured\u00a0being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher last Thursday. Wrecked: The document, issued by the NTSB, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport last Thursday. Above, Ford's wrecked plane after the crash. Document: Ford then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report (pictured) states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground. Meanwhile, Ford, who played Han Solo in the original Star Wars series, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. However, he is expected to make a full recovery. The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash. This meant he did not need to submit a flight plan. It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport'. Ford 'initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course,' the report states. It concludes: 'The airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.' The report was constructed 'using data from various sources' after 'a significant amount of investigative work'. It does not detail why Ford's engine might have failed, causing him to plummet to the ground. A final report is expected to be released when NTSB officials have finished their inquiry into the crash. Devoted: Ford suffered serious injuries in the crash, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. Above, his wife, Calista Flockhart, is seen on Tuesday driving home from hospital after spending the entire day with him. Recovery: Ford is being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (pictured) in Los Angeles, California. Last week, dramatic pictures emerged showing Ford being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher, his face covered in blood and his neck strapped into a brace. First responders were also pictured wrapping bandages around his head.\u00a0'He was stunned a bit,' spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana, who was playing golf at the course at the time, told ABC News. He added: 'He was moaning and in pain. It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious.' A video also emerged showing horrified golfers gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way as Ford deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground.

Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, remains in hospital recovering from the crash. His wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours.

{"article": "Lord Mandelson said there was almost certainly going to be a'stalemate hung Parliament' Former Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson has dismissed Labour's chances of winning a majority at the election. The Labour peer said there was almost certainly going to be a'stalemate hung Parliament'. Lord Mandelson also stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of Ed Miliband and once again attacked Labour's proposed'mansion tax' on expensive homes. He said the tax on properties worth over \u00a32million would not 'in a month of Sundays' raise the \u00a31.2 billion a year predicted by the Labour leader. Asked if the party would be doing better under another leader, the peer said: 'Do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping? It depends what you think people are voting for.' The Tories seized on the former business secretary's comments as proof that Labour is relying on support from the Scottish National Party to propel Mr Miliband into 10 Downing Street. Looking ahead to the election during a speech at the Retail Week Live conference in London, Lord Mandelson said: 'People basically are unhappy with what is on offer. 'They are therefore shopping around in politics in a way that the large parties are ill-equipped to deal with and which will almost certainly deliver us a stalemate hung Parliament in two months' time.' Answering questions after the speech, Lord Mandelson was asked if Labour would be doing better in the polls 'if it had a leader the public liked better'. After a long pause, the Labour peer replied: 'Do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping? 'It depends what you think people are voting for. People are voting for more than simply the personification of a party. 'Of course that is important, but they are voting for the party's values and the party's relevance, the quality of that product and whether they think that product - or in our case as politicians, that policy - will do for them. 'Of course, the leader has a responsibility for being the chief brand carrier of that product or policy. 'I think you will see that, as the real election campaign gets under way, the leader of the Labour Party will have the opportunities as well as the pressure to explain, get his message across and to draw others more towards him and the party in order to shape their voting decision.' Lord Mandelson stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of Ed Miliband in a question and answer session today. Speaking later at a Fabian conference in Westminster, Lord Mandelson said he had been trying to make the point that people should not become 'infatuated with personality-driven media-obsessed politics' which focus entirely on the identity of the leader. Discussing the mansion tax, he said: 'Not in a month of Sundays will it raise the amount of money that is projected. Everyone knows that it won't.' Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Lord Mandelson is confirming what we now all know - the only way Miliband will get into Downing Street is if he's carried there in Alex Salmond's pocket. 'That would mean more borrowing, higher taxes and weaker defences. Hard-working taxpayers would pay the price for the resulting economic chaos and a weak leader who simply isn't up to the job of being Prime Minister.' Michael Fallon wrote to the Labour leader demanding that he formally rule out a deal with the Scottish nationalists. Ed Miliband is facing mounting pressure to rule out negotiating with the SNP over Britain's Trident weapons system \u2013 after ministers announced \u00a3285million of new cash for the next generation of nuclear submarines. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon wrote to the Labour leader demanding that he formally rule out a deal with the Scottish nationalists. Mr Fallon said the Labour leader could only make it to Number 10 with the support of the SNP, who want the next government to scrap Britain's nuclear deterrent. He wrote: 'In an increasingly dangerous world, maintaining Britain's continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent, which has kept our nation safe for nearly 50 years, is paramount. 'That's why, today, I am announcing \u00a3285 million of investment to continue design work for the Royal Navy's next generation of nuclear deterrent submarines.' He said the SNP were putting the 'future of Britain's defences at risk'. Mr Fallon wrote: 'Will you now end the speculation and confirm that a future Labour Government led by you will not enter into any kind of deal whatsoever with the SNP \u2013 on Trident, or any other issue? 'If you do not, the British people will conclude that you are willing to sacrifice Britain's national security just to get your hands on the keys to Number 10.' The letter came after David Cameron claimed the former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond would be 'calling the tune' if Mr Miliband made it to Downing Street. In Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said Labour was not hoping to win an outright majority any more. 'They are just trying to crawl through the gates of Downing Street on the coat tails of the SNP,' he said. But Mr Miliband said there was 'only one person preparing", "abstract": "Lord Mandelson, a former Cabinet minister, has dismissed Labour's chances of winning a majority at the upcoming election, stating that there was almost certainly going to be a 'stalemate hung Parliament'.

{"article": "(CNN)Latest developments:. Full story:. Saudi Arabia has launched military operations in neighboring Yemen, where for months Houthi rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government, the Saudi ambassador to the United States told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Adel al-Jubeir said the operation consisted of airstrikes on more than one city and in more than one region. Yemen, a longtime stronghold for one of al Qaeda's most dangerous branches, has been plunged into chaos since the Houthi rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months. The unrest has led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces from Yemen, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there. How did Yemen get to this place? \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" al-Jubeir said. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be option for us or for our coalition partners.\" A leading member of the Houthis' political wing, Ansar Allah, said force will be met with force. \"This is a clear aggression and we will respond by a counteraggression,\" Ali Al Imad told CNN Arabic. \"The Saudi move will unite all the people of Yemen against the Saudis and the kingdom will pay the price.\" If the Saudis try to invade with ground troops, he said, they will fail. \"They probably will try to avoid that, but If it happened then they will pay a very high price,\" Imad said. The Saudi airstrikes appear to be targeting military compounds, headquarters and weapons storage areas. Journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital of Sanaa, said hundreds of explosions have caused residents to stay in their homes. \"I do expect the Sanaa of a couple of hours ago to be a different Sanaa in the morning,\" he said. A senior Arab diplomat told CNN that the Gulf Cooperation Council soon will issue a statement that the Yemenis have asked for military assistance and the GCC is prepared to step in. It will be signed by all GCC countries except for Oman. Not all countries will contribute military forces, the source said. Arab and senior administration officials from the United States told CNN that an interagency U.S. coordination team is in Saudi Arabia. The sources said the Saudis have not specified what they want yet, but will likely ask for American air support, satellite imagery, and other intelligence. \"We can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that, but there will be no military intervention by the U.S.,\" a senior administration official said. Al-Jubeir said the United States is not involved in the airstrikes against the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni nation. But the coalition includes more than 10 nations, he said, meaning more than the six GCC countries will be involved. Yemen, which has been in turmoil for months, shares a border with southern Saudi Arabia. \"We hope that the wisdom will prevail among the Houthis and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over Yemen and destroy it,\" Al-Jubeir said. Earlier Wednesday, rebel forces captured parts of the port city of Aden and a nearby Yemeni air base recently evacuated by U.S. forces, officials in the country said, with one rebel spokesman claiming that Yemen's president fled Aden as his opponents advanced. The rebels late Wednesday morning captured al-Anad air base, an installation that the last Yemen-based contingent of U.S. special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country, said Mohammed AbdulSalam, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels. The rebel forces -- Houthis and some allies in the Yemeni military -- then advanced on Aden, the nearby port city where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had taken refuge for weeks. There were conflicting reports Wednesday about Hadi's whereabouts. But one Houthi spokesman, Mohammed AlBukhaiti, said Hadi left  Aden on a boat with a Saudi diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city. AlBukhaiti told CNN that Hadi went to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. But a Saudi Arabian source told CNN's Nic Robertson that the President was still in Yemen in the early hours Thursday. Earlier, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters, \"It's pretty clear (Hadi) left voluntarily,\" without saying where Hadi had gone. She clarified that circumstances in Yemen caused him to leave his residence, but that rebels did not expel him. Two senior administration officials said it's unclear if he left Aden. The rebels' advance illustrated the growing power the Houthis have enjoyed since taking over Sanaa in January, and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key U.S. ally in the fight against then Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. For years, Yemen had allowed U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk AQAP in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters, along with any semblance of peace in the Middle Eastern", "abstract": "Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes on multiple cities in Yemen in an effort to protect the legitimate government of Yemen from Houthi rebels who have been intensifying their violent campaign against the government.

{"article": "A teenage boy has described the bizarre moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test. Byron Geldard, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was given the test by doctors because the disease can cause the body to make the same hormone produced during pregnancy. After getting a positive result, the 19-year-old was given the devastating news he had the disease and began seven months of treatment. Now, after surgery and intensive chemotherapy, he is in remission - and has become an ambassador for Teenage Cancer Trust. Scroll down for video. Byron Geldard, was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test. The disease can cause the body to produce the same hormone as produced during pregnancy. After the 'positive' result, the 19-year-old began months of treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Mr Geldard said: 'It was all very surreal to be honest. 'There I was with a positive pregnancy test and something growing inside me. I thought I was going to end up in a documentary.' Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta. Experts say beta hCG can also signal testicular cancer. Dr Danish Mazhar, Consultant Medical Oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals, said: 'The pregnancy hormone (HCG) is often (but not always) produced by testicular tumours. 'Where it is produced, it can used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. 'In cases where the cancer has spread, the level of the HCG can be very high and if the clinical picture fits with a testicular cancer then a pregnancy test, which effectively is a test for HCG in the urine, can be used to make the diagnosis.' Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta. Experts say beta HCG can also signal testicular cancer. Rob Cornes, Male Cancer Information Nurse at the charity Orchid, told MailOnline:\u00a0HCG is one of three blood tests performed in all men with testicular cancer - it identifies how active and possibly widespread the cancer may be. 'It can also be used to help monitor treatment and determine how well treatment is working and to identify men who may need more intensive treatment.' However he stressed there are two types of testicular cancer - and HGC is not present in the majority of cases of the most common form. And any man worried should not use a pregnancy test as a diagnostic tool. Mr Cornes added: 'To be picked up by a urine pregnancy test, the level of HCG has to be very high which will not be the case for many testicular cancers. 'It is not and never has been a standard test. 'HCG can also be raised in the presence of other things such as illegal performance enhancing drugs (used by athletes etc.)' Mr Geldard claims his hospital experience was as bizarre as his diagnosis. 'When I was about to go into surgery, I had to have an epidural like a pregnant woman - it was all very weird. 'It's really hard to describe how it felt - you don't really come to terms with what's going on, you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me. 'I'm relieved to be in remission, and now I want to help raise awareness. 'Cancer is no longer a death sentence, and I would like to spread that message.' Mr Geldard had just returned from a boy's holiday in Kavos last August, when a niggling pain in his side became too hard to ignore. After visiting his doctor, who could feel a mass in his abdomen, he was referred to his local hospital for an ultrasound. He said: 'Before I went to Kavos I'd been getting this weird pain on and off, but I didn't think much of it. 'I went to the GP about it, but because I was going to the gym it was just put down to muscle pain. 'But when I was referred to the local hospital scans showed that I had a tumour that was spreading into my lungs. 'I was told that it was cancer - but they weren't sure what type - and that I would probably need chemotherapy.' Mr Geldard was referred to the Teenage Cancer Trust unit in Cambridge, where doctors tried to determine what type of cancer he was suffering from. It was there that he was asked to provide a sample for a pregnancy test, to determine if the tumour was producing the hormones linked to both pregnancy, and testicular cancer. Looking back, Mr Geldard said:\u00a0'It's really hard to describe how it felt - you don't really come to terms with what's going on, you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise", "abstract": "A 19-year-old boy from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test.

And, in a picture in which her face has been Photoshopped with Cara's, their similarities are even more obvious. The fan captioned the split of their faces: 'I wish cara could follow me or like my pic. If you think that i look a little like her pls tag her its really important for me because she is my idol.

Pelle Wall testified in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom and described how happy and energetic his mother, Uta von Schwedler, had been in the year before she died, a death that was initially thought to be a suicide but is now believed by authorities to be a carefully plotted out murder on the part of her ex-husband and Pelle's father, John Wall. Pelle also described his father's erratic behavior in the hours after his mother died, including a moment when he sat down on his son's bed and said to the young man, then still a teenager, 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' Scroll down for video. Pelle Wall (above) took the stand in the murder trial of his mother, Uta von Schwedler, in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom on Wednesday. Pelle testified against his father John Wall (above), who is accused of killing his ex-wife and staging it to look like a suicide. According to the Deseret News, John had a very tempestuous relationship with his ex, and Pelle testified he would often say negative things about the woman in front of their children, telling them 'Uta's a bad parent' or 'Uta's making my life difficult.' He said on the stand the two would often argue when it came to the children, and that the last time he saw the two together, John rolled up his car window and drove off with the couple's four children in the middle of a conversation that the two were having in von Schwelder's driveway. Uta Von Schwedler (above) was found in her bathtub on Sept. 27, 2011 with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system. The next morning Pelle said he father was nowhere to be found, and when he returned home from school that afternoon he said the man had a large cut above his eye. Von Schwedler was found in her bathtub later that day with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system. That night, John woke his son up while he was sleeping and began displaying 'erratic behavior,' saying 'Uta's dead and they think I did it.' He then asked his son, 'Am I a monster?' and 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' Pelle testified that his mother had never taken any prescription pills or antidepressants to his knowledge, remembering her as 'happy' and 'energetic.' He also said that while his father initially seemed sad following the death of his ex-wife, that soon turned'more toward anger, hatred.' He also noted that after his parents first divorced, while he was still in elementary school, the children spent most of their time with their father, but that had changed in the years leading up to his mother's death, with custody split between the two parents, something that angered his father. The 21-year-old has long believed his father killed his mother, moving out of his home when he turned 18 and petitioning the court to remove his three younger siblings from his father's care shortly after.

{"article": "A transgender woman has spoken of her struggle to find work after she was sacked from her job in a factory for wearing too much make-up and then rejected by the boss of a cosmetics shop. Pammy Rose, who hit the headlines when she reached the final of a beauty contest without organisers realising she had been born a boy, says she has applied for hundreds of jobs but that no one wants to employ her. The 22-year-old, of Seaham, County Durham, who was born Paul Witten, has now been left with anxiety and depression due to the stress of job hunting. Scroll down for video. Transgender beauty queen Pammy Rose chose her name after hearing a joke likening her to Baywatch beauty Pamela Anderson. The 22-year-old has spoken out about her difficulty in trying to find work. She said: 'I tell people I am transgender as I am not going to hide who I really am. I have tried so hard to get a job but I feel like I am being discriminated against because people do not see me as a woman. 'When I went for an interview at a beauty shop the man interviewing me said he liked me and could see me working there. 'When I told him I was transgender his face dropped and I didn't hear from him again. 'I have applied to work in other shops where I live but I never hear anything back. I know it is because I am transgender. 'I have been trying to get a job for years now. I have sent out so many CVs but nobody replies to me.' The blonde first hit the headlines when she made it to the final of a beauty pageant without revealing that she has been born a boy. Pammy, who was born Paul, started bleaching her hair, wearing makeup and a girls' uniform by the age of 14. She become Pammy Rose officially at the age of 18. Pammy first told her mother, Julie, 49, that she did not want to be in her male body at the age of four. As a young boy called Paul, Pammy would dance and play with barbies and hated the idea of mud or football. The blonde said: 'When I was younger I was very feminine.I would wear heels and run around the house with a t-shirt on my head pretending it was hair. 'I would tell my mam I'm a girl and I don't belong in this body. I think she thought I was just going to be gay.' Pammy Rose was born Paul Witton and knew she didn't wanted to be male aged four. She embraced her femininity aged 14 and is currently on an NHS waiting list for gender reassignment surgery. Paul would tell his mum he was a girl, play with barbies and hated the idea of mud or football. During secondary school Pammy was singled out and targeted by bullies. She said: 'I was a tranny, puff, sick, a freak, they would call me all sorts of names. I was threatened and humiliated so much that I was scared to leave the house. 'I would never say anything back. I felt like a freak as nobody understood me.' But at the age of 14, Pammy decided to embrace who she really was. She started growing and bleaching her hair, wearing make-up full time and wearing the girls' uniform instead of the boys. Pammy said: 'I would constantly be upset and tell my mum I was trapped in the wrong body. 'Once I came out and told everyone I was a woman, everything became a lot easier.' Over the next three years Pammy travelled with her mother and stepfather Ray to London and later Leeds for monthly meetings with psychologists and doctors. A joke about her looking like Pamela Anderson soon led to her officially changing her name and at the age of 18 she became Pammy Rose. The following year, at the age of 19, she started taking hormones. In spring 2013 when she was 20-years-old she was entered into a local beauty contest - The Face of Sunderland - by a friend and made it to the final without the organisers realising she was transgender. Pammy said:'Until I told them in my interview, the organisers said they didn't even know I was transgender. 'I felt like I had to tell them because I really wanted to promote different people entering the competition.' Pammy has spent years looking for a job and after countless rejections finally got a role working in a food factory in January 2014. She said: 'In the interview I told them I was transgender and needed to wear make up to feel confident. 'I agreed to tone it down because of hygiene rules and they were fine with it.' But after ten months of working there Pammy was outraged to receive a phone call from the company telling her they were letting her go as she wore too much make up.

{"article": "The police force that guards the desert state of Utah will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty. Five-man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging America back to a'more barbaric past'. Facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most Death Row inmates are normally executed, Utah's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its Wild West past. Pictured is the Utah firing squad execution chamber, where death row inmates are strapped into the seat in front of a wooden board to stop bullets, and beside sandbags that absorb blood splatters. The state has become the first to bring back the firing squad. Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican governor, conceded that he found the concept 'a little bit gruesome', but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution. Yet such a scenario looks increasingly likely. Thirty-two states still have the death penalty, and America's Death Rows are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections. These have allowed lawyers to halt the scheduling of supposedly painless executions on the grounds that they breach a constitutional ban on 'cruel and unusual' punishment. To make matters worse, supplies of the sedatives used are drying up. Many of the most effective drugs are made only in Europe, but the EU has told manufacturers they cannot sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections. U.S. drug manufacturers have already stopped making them, worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of Americans come out against the death penalty. The result? In 2014, 35 people were executed in the U.S. \u2014 the fewest since 1994. Last July, appalled witnesses described how convicted Arizona double murderer Joseph Wood lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart. Now, with Utah's dramatic announcement, opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even Wood's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair. Witnesses described how double murderer Joseph Wood (pictured) lay gulping and gasping for two hours when a cocktail of drugs failed to sedate him. Although a firing squad may sound like a long-gone relic of frontier justice, the largely Mormon state of Utah did use one five years ago. In 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner, a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt, threatened to sue Utah if it didn't allow him to be shot. The state had stopped offering Death Row inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 \u2014 but because Gardner had been convicted before the law was changed, he was still able to choose it. Gardner, who had been on Death Row for 19 years, said: 'I guess it's my Mormon heritage. It's so much easier... and there's no mistakes.' Even though history has shown the killer's statement is not true, Utah's executioners will attempt to carry out the gruesome ritual with clinical precision. Attached to the state prison at Draper, the small execution room \u2014 built in an old canning factory \u2014 is flooded with fluorescent light from the ceiling and has no decorations on its white cinderblock walls. There are two slits for the marksmen cut into a wall, through which they aim their rifles. Observation windows \u2014 protected by bulletproof glass \u2014 line the side walls of the square chamber. Screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters' wall, a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets. Behind the chair is thick wooden panelling to stop the bullets. The entire structure is painted black. The inmate is bound to the chair with leather straps around the wrists, ankles, shoulders, waist and forehead \u2014 his immobility is crucial if the shooters are to hit his heart. Locating the heart with a stethoscope, a doctor fastens a piece of white cloth two inches square, with a circle in the middle, over the left breast of the prisoner's jumpsuit. Unseen by the condemned, or the victim's relatives and media representatives witnessing the execution on either flank, the squad of marksmen file in to take up position behind the wall facing their target. Ronnie Lee Gardner appears before a judge where the date for his execution by firing squad was set for June 2010. Gardner was a convicted murderer and said death by firing squad was'so much easier... and there's no mistakes' The officers are chosen from a pool of volunteers, with priority going to those from the local force where the inmate's crimes were committed. There are always more volunteers than places on the squad. Each officer is given an identical.30 calibre Winchester rifle, loaded with a single round. Following a Utah tradition which means no marksman knows whether he has fired a lethal shot, one of the rifles contains a blank round made of", "abstract": "Utah is set to bring back the firing squad as a method of execution, as the state faces a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most Death Row inmates are normally executed.

As the home side, GB can choose the venue for the July 17 clash against last year's runner-up. It is tempting to stick with the indoor hard court in Glasgow where the local fans created a tremendous atmosphere last weekend, but, in this case, the grass is greener. Andy Murray has a good record on hard courts against France's fearsome quartet of Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, winning 18 and losing five. But on grass, he has been totally dominant, unbeaten against all four in six matches. Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over John Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place. The Great Britain team celebrate their 3-2 victory over the USA in Glasgow last weekend. Doubles team Jamie Murray (left) and Dom Inglot have both experienced success on grass courts. Against Gasquet and Tsonga in particular, Murray can draw on the memories of some famous victories on the lawns. In 2011 the 27-year-old beat Tsonga in the final of the Aegon Championships at Queens. He also defeated the world No 13 in the Wimbledon semi-finals on the way to lifting the trophy in 2012. And it was a 2008 last-16 win against Gasquet on centre court that made the nation realise that this wild-haired Scot had something very special. A 21-year-old Murray stormed back from two sets down to win 5-7, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4. There is more good news for the doubles players. Julien Benneteau has reached 17 doubles finals but none have been on grass. Nicolas Mahut has won a tournament on the grass of Newport in 2013, but all of his other seven titles have come on an indoor hard court like Glasgow. Murray beat Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on grass in the 2012 Wimbledon semi-finals. The France team of Edouard Roger-Vasselin, Julien\u00a0Benneteau, Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon and Nicolas Mahut celebrate after their win against Germany in Frankfurt. Britain's pair of Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot, meanwhile, have thrived on grass.

{"article": "(CNN)The director of \"Midnight Rider\" has pleaded guilty to charges related to the 2014 death of a crew member while filming. Randall Miller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass Monday morning in Wayne County (Georgia) Superior Court, Deputy Clerk of Courts Betty Taylor said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced on March 24 the probable cause of the accident was trespassing by the film's crew. As part of the plea deal, Miller will spend two years behind bars and then serve eight years of probation. The deal prohibits him from directing films or being in any supervisory position in movies that would make him responsible for the safety of others for a period of 10 years. Miller, who was also ordered to pay $20,000 in fines and perform 360 hours of community service, was remanded in to custody of the sheriff to begin his sentence. A freight train hit members of the crew of the Gregg Allman biopic while they were working on a railroad bridge in February 2014. Camera assistant Sarah Elizabeth Jones, 27, was killed. The production had applied to the railroad company for permission to film on the bridge but was denied, according to the Savannah Morning News. Several other crew members were injured in the incident, CNN affiliate WTOC reported. 'Midnight Rider' pair surrender to authorities. Jones was mourned throughout  the film community. Friends set up a Facebook group, Slates for Sarah, and her death was noted in the Academy Awards' \"In Memoriam\" montage. Three additional members of the production staff faced charges related to the incident. As part of the plea agreement with Miller, charges were dropped against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, Taylor said. Miller and Savin are listed as owners of Unclaimed Fright Productions Inc., the film's production company, according to the indictment. Jay Sedrish, the film's executive producer, also received 10 years of probation. As part of his plea deal, he will be banned from supervisory positions in films for 10 years. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. A third member of the crew, first assistant director Hillary Schwartz, was found guilty after a bench trial, according to District Attorney Jackie Johnson's office. Schwartz was sentenced to 10 years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. Like the others, he was ordered not to be involved in the safety of film crews. Schwartz had made a deal to provide testimony for the state if the case went to trial, according to the district attorney's office.

Full-time doctors say it is \u2018demoralising\u2019 working alongside locums earning three or four times as much. United Lincolnshire Hospitals, which runs Lincoln County Hospital, pictured, paid \u00a33,258 for a consultant to work a 24-hour shift in A&E between Christmas and New Year. Figures obtained by Sky News show that United Lincolnshire Hospitals paid \u00a33,258 for a consultant to work a 24-hour shift in A&E between Christmas and New Year. Not all the money went to the doctor as the agency employing them will have taken a sizeable cut. Nonetheless, it is still a considerable amount bearing in mind the locum will have spent much of the shift asleep but \u2018on-call\u2019 \u2013 where they need to attend only in an emergency. Leeds Teaching Hospitals in West Yorkshire paid \u00a32,099 for a doctor to work a nine-hour shift in A&E over the same period \u2013 equivalent to \u00a3230 an hour. Three more trusts \u2013 the Royal Berkshire in Reading, Derby Hospitals and North Bristol \u2013 each paid around \u00a31,800 for an A&E nurse to work 12 hours. The figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show that at one trust, Airedale in West Yorkshire, more than 70 per cent of all doctors\u2019 shifts between Christmas and New Year were filled by locums. As they are generally less experienced and competent than full-time doctors employed by the trust, there is concern that such over-reliance could put patients at risk. The Royal Berkshire in Reading, pictured, Derby Hospitals and North Bristol \u00a0each paid around \u00a31,800 for an A&E nurse to work 12 hours. At the Heart of England NHS trust, 58 per cent of shifts between Christmas and New Year were filled by locums, while at the Royal Bolton it was 52 per cent. The NHS is short of A&E doctors partly because staffing levels have not kept pace with the rising number of patients, so trusts have to pay vast amounts to agencies. Dr Clifford Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \u2018Market forces really are quite extreme currently, with the lack of permanent people to employ. \u2018It means hospitals are desperate to try to find people to fill these slots and are having to pay super premium rates. It can be very demoralising to be working alongside somebody with much less experience, much more junior, who is earning a multiple income compared to you.\u2019 Last month a scathing report by the Public Accounts Committee warned that doctors and nurses were quitting to become locums because the pay rates were three or four times higher. It also highlighted how spending on agency staff had soared by a quarter in the past year to \u00a32.6billion. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association\u2019s council, which represents doctors, said: \u2018Locums play a vital role in the NHS but they should not be used as a long-term solution. Greater reliance on locums is a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government.\u2019 The Department of Health said: \u2018Since May 2010 we have more than 9,500 extra doctors and nearly 8,500 extra nurses.

The man accused of shooting at five public places in Maryland told police he heard voices directing him to fire at a random driver, according to charging documents released on Thursday. No one was killed or seriously hurt, but Hong Young, 35, is charged with attempted murder and assault in the first shooting \u2014 on February 24, at a mall \u2014 that wounded a 61-year-old man. The man, whose name is redacted in the charged documents, told police a car pulled up beside his, and the driver 'produced a gun and pointed it' at him. The man said he heard several shots and felt pain in his right shoulder, according to the documents, but it wasn't until he got home that he realized he'd been grazed by a bullet. The victim, identified as a Korean man, made the report with the help of his son, who translated for police. It was the first in a string of five shootings, including one at a National Security Agency building, that had central Maryland police on high alert for more than a week. Young was arrested on Tuesday night when officers spotted his car parked in a vacant mall lot close to the site of the first shooting. Young told the officers he had come from the Maryland Live! Casino and had trouble finding his car. The officers noticed shell casings in the car and a handgun on the front passenger seat. Police found an arsenal of weapons, including a crossbow and hundreds of rounds of ammunition when they searched Hong Young's home in Beltsville on Wednesday. Young was taken into custody, court records show, where he waived his right to have an attorney present during police questioning. Police said on Thursday that they were also investigating reports of damage to the exterior of the casino from possible bullet holes. Police said they were told of the damage by casino management on Wednesday. No injuries were reported nor were there any reports of shots fired. Law enforcement officials are still investigating a motive. 'Clearly, he was continuing to do it until he got caught,' Anne Arundel County Police spokesman T.J. Smith said. 'This guy apparently has some other issues going on (that) our detectives continue to follow up on.' Young filed for divorce in September after nearly seven years of marriage. The case was dismissed on Monday because his wife, Bunnary Ngo, had not been served with documents in the case, according to court records in Prince George's County. The man accused of shooting at five public places in Maryland told police he heard voices directing him to fire at a random driver, according to charging documents released on Thursday.

Joy Abraham, 65, who lives next door to Hong's two-story red brick home, said he remembered the younger man seeming 'withdrawn.' Young had been taken to a hospital after his arrest but was later released and ordered held without bond at a maximum-security detention facility in Annapolis. He has a bail hearing before a judge set for Friday. Authorities said they didn't know whether he had an attorney to comment on the charges against Young, and none was listed for him in online court records. Young was a prison guard from January 2012 to May 2014, according to Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary Stephen Moyer. 'There was nothing significant about his employment,' Moyer said. 'He was assigned to one of the medium (security) facilities in Jessup. He resigned. There was nothing remarkable about his file.' Investigators said they matched the casings and a.380 semi-automatic handgun to last week's shooting. The gun was legally registered to Young.

The men reported missing last week, Nicholas Figueroa and Moises Locon, were thought to have been at a sushi restaurant at the time of the explosion. Crews are still searching the scene, Nigro said, even though it's unlikely there are other victims. Three buildings collapsed and four others were damaged Thursday by the explosion and raging gas-fueled fire that followed. Nigro declined to discuss details about what caused the blast, saying an investigation is ongoing. Investigators are looking into whether a gas line was \"inappropriately accessed\" at the building where the explosion occurred, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Friday. Gas utility inspectors checking on work in the building's basement left the premises about 30 minutes before the explosion.

A convicted rapist sentenced to 14 years  has been granted a marriage licence to wed his long-term girlfriend so he can receive conjugal visits while in prison. Kevin Mitchell violently attacked the 30-year-old woman inside her own apartment in New York in the early hours of the morning, threatening her that he had a gun and would slit her throat. Mitchell, 34, pleaded guilty to one count of Rape in the First Degree at Manhattan Supreme Court on February 11, 2015. However, instead of being sent straight to a state penitentiary in upper New York State immediately, Mitchell was granted a one-month stay in Rikers Island so he could get married to Tyneka Hudson. Ms Hudson told the New York Daily News following her would-be husband's sentence: 'I'm going to stay by his side. He's a good man.' Prosecutors claim that Mitchell followed his victim into her apartment at 5.30am on the day of the attack. However, Ms Hudson questions the verdict. She said: 'No one knows the real story. Only she and him know. I can\u2019t say he did it. I can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t do it. He told me he didn\u2019t rape the lady. He said they were drinking and he put a hickey on her. I don\u2019t know what he was doing in her apartment.' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said: 'This lengthy prison sentence reflects the extremely violent nature of this attack, in which Kevin Mitchell raped a woman in her own home. 'I would like to thank the survivor for coming forward, and my office\u2019s Sex Crimes prosecutors for ensuring that this predator will serve years behind bars.' Prosecutor Siobhan Carty told Manhattan Supreme Court that Mitchell surreptitiously entered the woman's apartment on September 19, 2013 at 5.30am and threatened her with a knife and said he had a gun. After the attack, the victim rang 911 and NYPD's Warrant Squad arrested Mitchell four days later. Ms Carty read the victim's statement into the court record in advance of Mitchell's sentencing. She said on behalf of the victim: 'This man has completely ruined my life. I have tried to rationalise what I could have done in my life to have deserved what happened to me. The only conclusion that I have come up with is that some people in this world are truly terrible.' 'I cannot understand why the man did this to me. Why he told me he would kill me if I didn\u2019t do what he said. 'I do not know if he raped me because I only had $24, or if that was the initial reason that he broke into my apartment.

{"article": "The White House is reportedly considering a new power play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would paint Benjamin Netanyahu into a corner just days after his stunning come-from-behind victory in his country's hotly contested elections. In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu vowed in an historic U-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. But now President Barack Obama is contemplating using the United Nations as a trump card to force the issue. Under a plan outlined by Foreign Policy\u00a0magazine, the U.S. State Department would ease away from decades of opposition to a Security Council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The White House cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on Thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic, saying only that it would 'evaluate what our path is forward' is in light of Netanyahu's comments. NOT SO FAST... The White House is considering a Netanyahu smackdown in the form on United Nations leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with Palestinians. WATCHING AND WAITING: State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US is evaluating its options \u2013 leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a UN two-state solution pushed on Israel. The U.S. and Israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship. A former top-level Obama campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with Netanyahu's political opposition \u2013 even as the president refused to meet with Netanyahu this month, saying he didn't want to influence the election's outcome. The Obama administration hoped to see Netanyahu's left-wing rival, Isaac Herzog, prevail on Tuesday. Diplomats at the UN privately learned in the run-up to Election Day that the U.S. would not press the UN Security Council on peace talks if Herzog were to win, since he would likely have carried the ball on his own. But with Netanyahu poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties opposed to a Palestinian state, all bets are off. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that 'we\u2019re currently evaluating our approach. We\u2019re not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action.' The chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue reiterated the administration's position on Thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the United States' part. He also refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's victory, stating that, obviously, the president was 'aware' of it when asked by a reporter if Obama was 'disappointed' with the election results. Complicating the situation, the Palestinian Authority says it might take grievances against Israel, stemming from last year's brief Gaza war, to the International Criminal Court. The Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s top diplomat in the United States explained to Foreign Policy that the PA could formally accuse Israel of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks. Israel has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians, but insists militants from the Hamas terror group took shelter where\u00a0collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire. Turning to the ICC for redress would prove costly for Palestinians, however. The United States provides about $500 million in annual aid to the PA, and $400 million of that is drawn from an Economic Support Fund that members of Congress from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off. The U.S. has paid out approximately $5 billion in aid money to the Palestinian Authority since the 1990s, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \u2013 representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community. But at the end of January an astonishing 75 out of 100 U.S. senators signed a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry warning that any Palestinian action against Israel in the ICC would be met by a budget axe. The 2015 budget appropriations bill, signed by Obama, explicitly\u00a0prohibited funding for the PA if it were to initiate \u2013 or even actively support \u2013 an ICC probe related to war crimes accusations against Israel. BIG CHILL: President Barack Obama has had the frostiest relationship with Israel of any US leader since the 1970s. The senators warned Kerry that Abbas was illegally challenging 'Israel\u2019s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory.' PA President Mahmoud Abbas officially joined the ICC late last year. In the days following the seating of the new Congress in January \u2013 long before Netanyahu notched his surprising re-election win \u2013 the State Department seemed to lean toward supporting the Senate. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters then that action in the ICC could have unspecified 'implications' for future U.S.-Palestinian aid. 'Congress has a great deal of power in that regard,' she said. But administration officials are now leaning toward using the United Nations to force Netanyahu into a tricky spot. 'We are signaling that if the Israeli government\u2019s position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state, we\u2019re going to have to broaden the", "abstract": "The White House is considering using the United Nations to force Benjamin Netanyahu into breaking his campaign promise about peace with Palestinians. The US State Department would ease away from decades of opposition to a Security Council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The US and Israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship, and the Obama administration hoped to see Netanyahu's left-wing rival, Isaac Herzog, prevail on Tuesday."}

Pyne has been attempting to overhaul the education system, introducing laws that would allow universities to set their own fees and financially penalise graduates who do not repay their student debts, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Despite the second time failing to convince the Senate, Pyne has vowed he will never give up on his higher education campaign. Speaking to Nine news, Pyne said: 'I never give up, no, I will not give up. It's too important to allow the Labor Party who are political opportunists and the Greens who are the same, to wreck this reform.' During the show, Mr Pyne admitted if the higher education reform failed to be passed it could cause a double dissolution. He has pledged to reintroduce higher education reforms after they were defeated in the Senate on Tuesday.

{"article": "A defiant father-of-ten who has had his Christmas lights up for almost five months  is refusing to take them down despite being branded a 'pikey'. Kevin Franklin got a friend to put up the huge festive display on his council house after he suffered a stroke in November. He stopped turning them on in January but said they helped calm his autistic son Bradley, 15, and plans to switch them back on for Autism Awareness Month in April. Despite the good cause he has received a poison pen-letter from someone on his street in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, calling his family 'pikeys' and the lights 'grotesque', 'tacky' and 'an eyesore'. The letter said: 'I know you live in a council house but there's no need to make it look like one'. Row: Defiant father-of-ten Kevin Franklin is refusing to take down the Christmas lights still hanging outside his council house. Backlash: A neighbour put this poison-pen letter through his door, calling the lights 'grotesque' and the family 'pikeys' Good cause: Mr Franklin says that the lights are good for his autistic son Bradley so he has kept them up since November. Mr Franklin now says he has even more lights in his garage, which he will add to the collection on his house. He suspects that the abuse has come from people on his street who have bought their house. Sad: Kevin, 53, who lives with wife Michele, 46, who cares for Bradley full-time, said the letter upset him. The poison pen writer sent an anonymous letter addressed to 'the pikeys that live at number 80'. It read: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque, tacky, council house Christmas lights. 'It is March for goodness sake. Your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace. It looks like a state. It sticks out like a sore thumb. 'I don't want to keep driving past this eyesore, every time I do my kids scream. 'I know you live in a council house but there's no need to make it look like one. 'Yours sincerely, A very disgruntled citizen.' Kevin, 53, who lives with wife Michele, 46, who cares for Bradley full-time, said the letter had upset him but said he planned to put up more lights, rather than take them down. He said: 'I was shocked and quite upset when I got the letter. But they're not coming down. They're not doing anybody any harm. 'I don't switch them on until it comes nearer Christmas. 'Apart from that they're going on in April which is autism awareness month, because I have a 15-year-old autistic son. 'I've had neighbours who have said they will join in and also donate to autism charities.' Response: Mr Franklin has refused to cave in to pressure and says he will put even more lights up. Festive cheer: The family believe it brightens up the area but a disgruntled neighbour told them: \u00a0'I know you live in a council house but there's no need to make it look like one' Fundraising: The Franklins hope that the display will raise cash for autism charities. He added: 'I think the person who sent the letter comes from the posh side of the street. 'Our side is all council houses while the other side is where the houses have been bought. 'They think they're better than us but the only difference between us and them is that they buy their pile of bricks and we rent ours. It's still my house and I'm proud of it. 'We keep our garden nice and tidy but we like the lights. The principle is nobody tells me what to do in my house. 'We're going to make sure the house is covered and really give them something to whine about.' One neighbour said a petition was started to try to get Kevin to remove the Christmas lights, although many residents in the street are divided over the ongoing display. Matthew Ludley said: 'I heard someone started a petition and a few people had complained, I don't know who would have sent the letter though. 'I'm not really bothered by the lights being up, it doesn't really affect me.' Another resident, John Rogers, 71, said: 'I'm with the old age pensioner lot. There is a big divide between the people who have purchased their houses and the council house lot. Conspiracy: Mr Franklin suspects the rude note came from people on his street (pictured) who may have bought their house. 'I'm not offended by the lights, I think if he has been ill then that's actually a good enough reason not to take them down. 'I think it's a bit petty to send a letter, you would think they would just talk to him.' Another resident, who asked not to be named, said the author of the letter was'sad'. The word 'pikey' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century", "abstract": "A father-of-ten in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, who has had his Christmas lights up for almost five months, is refusing to take them down despite being branded a 'pikey'.

The child, who has not been named, ran into Dayton's Bluff Achievement Plus Elementary where teachers found him hysterically crying on Wednesday around 3.40pm, according to the criminal complaint. Shortly after, the  principal told police his step-mom, Tashay Caprice Johnson, 24, came running into the school. A boy, nine, told police he ran to his school after his step mom allegedly told him she was going to kill him (Tashay Caprice Johnson pictured above) Johnson, 24, was arrested following the incident and charged with making terroristic threats and malicious punishment of a child. The boy claimed Johnson hit him on the head with a baseball bat, struck him in the face with her fist and also hit him in the arm with a belt before telling him she was going to grab a gun and kill him. Johnson was arrested and faces up to five years in prison if convicted of both charges including making terroristic threats and malicious punishment of a child. Police said they found injuries that matched the trauma the boy described including swelling on the left side of his head and marks on his left arm that appeared to be from a belt, according to\u00a011Alive. They also found scratches near his left eye and the right side of his neck. While officers were speaking to Johnson at her home, they later found the baseball bat and arrested her. Johnson, right, denied assaulting the boy and told police she had agreed with his dad to have him sit in the corner as punishment but he kept running around the house. On Wednesday after the boy ran into the school, the principal blocked Johnson from entering until they could piece together what had transpired. The boy told police earlier that day his teacher had walked him home so that she could talk to his parents about his behavioral problems at school. Once the teacher left their home, that is when he said Johnson told him he was going to get a 'whooping'. After she allegedly hit him and said she was going to get the gun, he fled from home. Johnson denied assaulting the boy or threatening to kill him, and she did not know how he got the belt marks on his arm, according to Twin Cities. She told police that after the teacher left their home, she spoke to the child's father and they both decided to have him sit in the corner as punishment, but he ran around the house instead, the complaint said. Following Johnson's arrest, the boy's father jumped and said 'I whoop that kid but it doesn't do any good'. If she is convicted of the charges, Johnson faces  $10,000 in fines for the terroristic threat charge and $3,000 in fines for the malicious punishment charge, according to KSTP.

{"article": "The implantation of memories is a common feature in sci-fi films, such as Inception and Total Recall. But now, for the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept. The feat  gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories, which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds. For the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep. The technique could one day be used to change human memories, such in in films like Total Recall and Inception ( a still from the film is shown) The brain typically replays the day\u2019s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents, so too is their ability to remember what they learned \u2013 for example, a new area that they explored \u2013 the previous day, New Scientist reported. Scientists from the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris, France, used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept. The team, led by Karim Benchenane, focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about, or being in, a specific place \u2013 and help animals and humans form internal maps. The brain typically replays the day\u2019s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example.\u00a0Scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep (stock image) In the same way that humans sometimes remember things that didn\u2019t actually occur, researchers have found that bees also misremember. It\u2019s the first time that false memories have been observed in non-human animals. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) tested to see if bumblebees would confuse merged versions of patterns that had previously rewarded them with food, with the ones they had actually seen. They found that if they\u2019d previously been shown a flower with black rings and then a yellow one, that they would later seek food rewards from a flower with yellow rings on it. This incorrect merging of long-term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans. The researchers think that such memory errors are probably common in animals whose lifestyle involves regularly juggling multiple memories. Professor Lars Chittka, from QMUL\u2019s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: \u2018That people form false memories is well understood but it has never been seen in other animals before. \u2018There are a lot of similarities between our own memories and those of other animals. \u2018The more we know about the way that memory works in the animal kingdom the more we\u2019ll be able to understand our own memory and the problems we have with it.\u2019 He monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an \u2018arena\u2019 using electrodes, isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location. While the mice slept, they monitored the creature\u2019s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired, an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward. When the mice woke up, they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling, showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists. While this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep, experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people \u2013 so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs, for example. Experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept, they would have explored the area in a more random way, instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward. \u2018The mouse develops a goal-directed behaviour to go towards the place,\u2019 Dr Benchenane said. \u2018It proves that it's not an automatic behaviour. What we create is an association between a particular place and a reward that can be consciously accessed by the mouse.\u2019 He thinks it could take years for the technique to be adapted to implant different kinds of memories such as skills, for example, but hopes that it could be developed to alter traumatic memories in people. He believes that positive thoughts could be attached to negative memories to stop people having nightmares or dwelling on upsetting events. \u2018If you can identify where in the brain a person is reactivating a phobia-associated experience, you might be able to create a positive association,\u2019 he said. The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.", "abstract": "Scientists have successfully implanted conscious memories into the minds of mice while they slept, using the brain's replay process to create new memories in the brains of the animals.

{"article": "I\u2019m starting to think Adam Lallana might actually become a better version of Steven Gerrard. He\u2019s certainly got all the qualities that make him the perfect replacement for the Liverpool captain. I appreciate that Jordan Henderson is set to take over as skipper, but in terms of dynamism, energy and quality, Lallana looks like the perfect replacement for Gerrard the player. Have a look at Sunday\u2019s victory over Manchester City: Lallana started the game as one of two No 10s behind Raheem Sterling (Brendan Rodgers\u2019 innovative approach as a coach should not be underestimated). When Lazar Markovic went off, Lallana went over to the right wing, and then when Alberto Moreno was substituted, Lallana ended the game on the left wing. Adam Lallana (centre) gave an all-action display as Liverpool impressively beat Manchester City. Lallana chats with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during training on Monday. He is truly two-footed \u2013 for that reason alone English football should treasure him. But he is also clearly capable of playing in different positions, and he can adapt midway through a game. Those qualities are not readily available in most players and it takes me back to the Champions League final of 2005 when Gerrard ended up at right back. The very best not only play different positions, they excel in those positions as well. Lallana still has to prove he can do it, as Gerrard did, in a major final, but he proved it in a massive game on Sunday. A simple five-minute chat about Lallana with Rodgers will have him purring. The Liverpool manager will be using words and phrases like 'balance', 'clever', 'worker', 'technical ability', 'awareness', 'great character', 'looks after the ball'. Bring up the subject of Lallana and you could be there all day with Rodgers. On Sunday all the talk was of Philippe Coutinho, and understandably so. The brilliance of his goals alone in recent weeks makes him the hot topic and it\u2019s great to see him add consistency to the undoubted quality. But Lallana\u2019s contribution should not go unnoticed. Philippe Coutinho (2nd right) curled home Liverpool's winner late on in the Premier League clash at Anfield. Vice-captain Jordan Henderson (right, front) also scored a screamer for the Reds on Sunday. One thing you might not know about Lallana is that in Rodgers\u2019 words, he is 'no shrinking violet'. He has bags of personality and character off the pitch as well as on it, and good leadership qualities \u2013 let\u2019s not forget he was captain of Southampton as they returned to re-establish themselves in the Premier League. For Liverpool\u2019s system he is perfect. He has quality on the ball \u2013 did you see his Cruyff turn in the centre circle against City? Breathtaking stuff \u2013 he creates \u2013 he scores (probably could score more) \u2013 and he presses the ball. He was injured pre-season, so it was a slow start to his Liverpool career and some supporters were too quick to judge. Rodgers knew that opponents\u2019 approach to Liverpool would be different this season, he knew he would need players to be clever on the ball, and Lallana has that football intelligence. Lallana - who played three positions against City - shows his defensive qualities challenging Sergio Aguero. He doesn\u2019t get talked about too much, does he? Is that because he\u2019s English? Probably. But Rodgers told me this about Lallana: 'He\u2019s technically as good as any European player'. Some might disagree, but it rams home the point that we don\u2019t value his qualities highly enough in this country. In the feverish pace of the Premier League, Lallana still makes time for himself on the ball, and has that football intelligence and ability to make an impact on a game. Yet somehow, if he is only on the bench for England later this month it won\u2019t be a surprise. And that\u2019s a shame in my opinion. Gerrard\u2019s departure will still hurt Liverpool fans, but I expect Lallana to grow even more when the legend leaves. He\u2019s one of the most underrated footballers in the Premier League. Lallana slides in to have an effort on the Manchester City goal that went narrowly wide of the target.", "abstract": "The article argues that Adam Lallana has the potential to become a better version of Steven Gerrard and is the perfect replacement for the Liverpool captain. Lallana's ability to play in different positions, adapt midway through a game, and his technical ability make him a valuable asset to Liverpool's system. Despite being underrated, Lallana has the potential to grow even more when Gerrard leaves."}
{"article": "For a man who had just made it to the Champions League quarter-finals and broken the record for goals scored in European competition, Cristiano Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure as he left the pitch shaking his head on Tuesday. The mood of the world's best player hadn't changed when he emerged from the home-team dressing room and told waiting television crews that he would not be talking again publicly until the end of the season. The significance of 'the end of the season' is that by then we will know just how much a campaign that promised so much for Real Madrid has delivered. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring, but he couldn't prevent his side slumping to a 4-3 defeat. Ronaldo vowed he would not talk publicly again this season after the defeat by Schalke on Tuesday. Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo watches on with his hands on his hips as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar celebrates. Much more will also be known about the futures of Ronaldo - Real Madrid's top scorer \u2014 and also his team-mate Gareth Bale and his coach Carlo Ancelotti. Supporters at the Bernabeu turned on Ancelotti even before Real's 4-3 defeat by Schalke had started, with the manager's name jeered as it was announced before kick-off. Bale was whistled at in the second half while goalkeeper Iker Casillas also bore the brunt of the discontent, more justifiably because he could have done more about Schalke's first two goals. When Casillas, as captain, summoned his team-mates into the centre-circle at the final whistle they went reluctant \u2014 Ronaldo more than most \u2014 but were met with more resounding boos and a show of white handkerchief protest. Casillas has said he wants to stay until he is 40 but Real want Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, and every day that passes without him signing a new deal at Old Trafford leads them to believe they still have a chance. Some Real Madrid fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle on Tuesday night. Iker Casillas has been below his best for some time, but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds. Casillas called on his team-mates to acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat. Casillas pulls midfielder Isco toward the centre circle to applaud the fans. United will be watching the potential unravelling of Real's season closely. The campaign could still end gloriously if important injured players like Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and the fit-again Luka Modric return to their best ahead of the Champions League latter rounds. But what if things don't end well? United have made little secret of wanting Bale at the end of this campaign. He is happy in Spain but how many times can a player have his first mistake verbally chastised by his own fans before he starts to wonder if he might not be better off elsewhere? The former Tottenham star is not a particularly social animal and has not put down any great emotional roots in the city. United must be encouraged by the fact that despite him winning four trophies in his first year at the club, supporters are doing nothing to cultivate a lasting bond. Gareth Bale was subjected to boos from Real Madrid fans as they were beaten at home by Schalke. Bale has not scored for the Champions League winners in his last nine appearances. The former Tottenham player endured another night to forget as Real were beaten but crept through. United have also considered the impact that recapturing Ronaldo would create. And they were interested in Ancelotti before they turned to Louis van Gaal to replace David Moyes. The Italian stayed at Madrid and won his third Champions League but he is now drawn to the idea of an English return and the wheels have been set in motion to push his profile in England \u2013 not that anyone needs reminding how well he did at Chelsea. No-one at Madrid is suggesting Ronaldo, Bale and Ancelotti all park up at Old Trafford this summer with De Gea moving the other way but there is a sense that there will be an overhaul at the end of the season and with instability prevailing it might not just be squad players such as Alvaro Arbeloa, Fabio Coentrao, Asier Illaramendi and Sami Khedira who leave. At any club such rumblings would be dismissed as ridiculous but the knee-jerk short-termism at Madrid is nothing new. Carlo Ancelotti, pictured hugging Roberto Di Matteo, is under growing pressure at the Bernabeu. Ancelotti's future at Real is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th European Cup. Ancelotti looks to the skies as his side sneak into the last eight of the Champions League. An online poll asking which striker should be dropped from the 'BBC' front three of Benzema, Bale and Cristiano (the one that was 'the best in the world' just three months ago) was carried out this week by Diario AS. Bale registered 40 per cent and Ronaldo 33 per cent.

{"article": "As a schoolgirl, Emma Lavelle had twin passions \u2014 politics and horses. Had she chosen to pursue the former, spring 2015, with an election looming, could well have proved an important time in her life. But the woman who now runs a 70-box stable in Hampshire is hoping that, having favoured horses over Hansard, the same period definitely turns out to be momentous when she saddles Court By Surprise, her first runner in the \u00a31 million Crabbie's Grand National on April 11. If the 10-year-old wins, Lavelle would be the third female trainer to win Jump racing's best known race this century following Venetia Williams, with Mon Mome in 2009 and Sue Smith, with Auroras Encore in 2013. Emma Lavelle poses with Court By Surprise, her first runner in the \u00a31 million Crabbie's Grand National. And she would also be feted, along with her former jockey husband and assistant Barry Fenton, for executing a long-term precision plan. Court By Surprise has not run since November as Lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground on which he excels. Lavelle said: 'I did a lot of public speaking and debating at school. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. Love her or hate her, she was a big presence. I loved her. As a schoolgirl, Lavelle had twin passions \u2014 politics and horses - now she is targeting the Grand National. 'She got me interested in politics. I am opinionated and I like talking. I am not so sure now because it is all so grey but at the time I would have been happy to go down that road.' Lavelle's communication skills with owners and staff have been essential after a devastating setback at the start of the season when she lost two of her best horses. Timesremembered, who had finished sixth in the Coral Cup at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival, was killed in his first steeplechase, at Aintree in October, and Le Bec, thought capable of contesting top-quality steeplechases, suffered a serious tendon injury at Ascot a week later. Court By Surprise has not run since November as Lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground. Lavelle said: 'It really hit us hard. It was like a football team losing their best two players at the start of the season. 'It was hard to pick up and get going again. But you have to keep positive, keep going forward and take your team with you.' Lavelle's season has been rebuilt around Grade Two winner Closing Ceremony, much-improved Parish Business, exciting Bumper winner See The World and, of course, Court By Surprise, who is owned by Kempton chairman Nick Mustoe. Lavelle's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by the late Toby Balding. Court By Surprise ridden by Aidan Coleman clears the last to win the  Best Mate Handicap Steeple Chase. The National entry, who will be ridden at Aintree by Daryl Jacob, won at Exeter in October and was then awarded the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton after finishing second to fast-improving unqualified entry, The Young Master. Subsequent events tell us Court By Surprise faced handicapping Everest that day. For Saturday week, trainer and horse have that essential Aintree ingredient \u2014 a good story to tell. Lavelle's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by working for the late Toby Balding, who won the Aintree race twice. Lavelle, who was first invited to spend a week with Balding aged 11 when he trained a horse for her father, said: 'I was so lucky he let me be so involved. I wasn't strong enough to carry the water bucket in the morning. I filled it and had to get someone to carry it back to the stable. When I look back I found it staggering that, even having ridden ponies, he let me ride racehorses. The National entry, who will be ridden at Aintree by Daryl Jacob, won at Exeter in October. 'He was someone you could learn as much as you wanted to off. If you asked the questions, he would give you the answers. He was a big man who enveloped you in everything.' Court By Surprise, an overpriced 50-1 shot allotted 10st 3lb, has overcome two serious problems \u2014 a leg injury when falling on his point-to-point debut and an infected leg which kept him off the course for almost two years and could have ended his career. Lavelle added: 'Having missed the best part of two years, he has not had much racing but maybe it is a blessing in disguise; he is so much stronger. Now, he's the best he's ever been.'", "abstract": "Emma Lavelle, a former schoolgirl with twin passions for politics and horses, is hoping to win the \u00a31 million Crabbie's Grand National with her first runner, Court By Surprise.

{"article": "Former Northern Ireland international and Real Mallorca striker Gerry Armstrong is an expert analyst and commentator for Sky Sports\u2019 coverage of Spanish football. Here, he shares his thoughts with Sportsmail's Craig Hope on the Gareth Bale saga at Real Madrid\u2026. Gareth is under a lot of pressure and sometimes that can get to you. But the recent criticism aimed at him is completely unfounded and unnecessary. I have seen him play really well this season and I have seen him play some indifferent games. He is probably having a decent season, but it could still be brilliant. Real are only four points behind Barcelona in the league and you would fancy them to get past Atletico and into the last four of the Champions League. Gareth Bale was heavily criticised after Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Liga rivals Barcelona. An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca. Bale has been criticised by Real  supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013. And don\u2019t forget what an impact he had last year. He scored in the final of the Champions League and Copa del Rey and finished with 22 goals. He's on 16 now and will better that total this year, what more can you ask? All this talk of dropping him is rubbish \u2013 you can\u2019t drop Gareth Bale, he scores and creates too many goals. Real have been going through a slump in the past five weeks or so. They have been missing key players. But it seems Gareth has been taking a lot of the stick from fans, and I don\u2019t agree with that, although he has probably been trying too hard at times. Now that Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are back I think you\u2019ll see Gareth really re-emerge and rediscover his best form, because I admit he wasn\u2019t great against Barcelona on Sunday. He wasn\u2019t the only top player to disappoint, but he disappeared from the game for long periods and sometimes he needs to be more forceful. The Wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against Levante on March 15. Cracks seem to be appearing in Bale's relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. On the issue of him being unhappy, only he knows how happy he really is at Madrid. Part of the problem is the language and being comfortable with your team-mates. Then there is the situation with Cristiano Ronaldo. I wouldn\u2019t say the relationship between himself and Ronaldo is bad, but Cristiano was so petulant when Gareth scored his goals against Levante last week - he could not hide the disappointment from his face. He\u2019s like a spoilt brat at times. But the fans are so forgiving with Ronaldo because of the goals he scores, it\u2019s very unfair. They say Gareth should pass more to Ronaldo - that\u2019s nonsense. It was the same with Cesc Fabregas and the pressure on him to pass to Lionel Messi at Barcelona. It\u2019s not helpful. AS say Real'missed and they paid for it' while Marca highlight Madrid's misses during the La Liga match. I would like to see Gareth say, \u201cI\u2019m better than all of this\u201d and prove how good he is on the pitch - and I think he will because he has got great ability. He\u2019s got everything - he scores goals and creates them, he\u2019s brilliant in the air, he strong, he\u2019s fast, he\u2019s aggressive. For me, he\u2019s very close to being right up there with Messi and Ronaldo. There is talk of him going to Manchester United, but it would be a huge mistake on Real\u2019s part if they agreed to sell him. If I was him though I\u2019d keep my options open and see how I feel at the end of the season. But I think he will still be at Madrid next season. This will blow over given a few goals and the team clicking again. In a few weeks\u2019 time I\u2019d bet we\u2019ll be having completely different discussions about Gareth and all of this will be forgotten.", "abstract": "Former Northern Ireland international and Real Mallorca striker Gerry Armstrong has defended Gareth Bale, stating that the recent criticism aimed at him is unfounded and unnecessary.

{"article": "What do Beethoven, birthday cake and the way your eyes move have in common? They're all conspiring to get you to spend more money when you eat out. While we are all prepared to splash out in restaurants, it's become clearer that restaurateurs have devised crafty ways to make sure we spend more than we had planned to. And while it might not seem unacceptable to charge corkage for when you bring your own wine to an eatery, there are now a number of London restaurants who charge cakeage fees - a sum to serve diners birthday cake - which can sometimes come up to \u00a39 per person. Scroll down for video. Stung by your bill? Restaurants have devised sneaky ways to make diners pay more when they eat out. Not so happy birthday: London eateries are now charging 'cakeage' where diners have to pay to be served birthday cake. From using hyperbole to convince you to order pricier items to drawing your eye to parts of the menu they want you to look at, eateries have devised intelligent ways to ensure that you end up spending more than you planned to. Playing with numbers and omitting dollar and pound signs. Restaurant menus tend to attach prices that end with the number nine to dishes  as it indicates a bargain is being had. For example, a diner would be willing to pay for a dish that costs \u00a319.99 then they would for something which is marked as \u00a320. According to the New York Times, prices which end with.95 instead of.99 are even more conducive to making people spend as they 'feel friendlier' to diners. The publication reported: 'In the world of menu engineering and pricing, a dollar sign is pretty much the worst thing you can put on a menu.' Gregg Rep, a menu consultant in California said to news.com.au: 'Dollar signs remind people of money. When you use dollar signs, your food looks more expensive.' A study by Cornell University's Centre for Hospitality Research, US, found that when dollar signs were left off a menu, sales increased by eight per cent. Kaspar's Seafood Bar & Grill in London's Savoy Hotel (pictured) charges \u00a39 per person for birthday cake. Anchoring. Another key trick is known as 'anchoring'. This is where a restaurant places a highly expensive dish prominently on the menu \u2014 solely in order to make the other dishes nearby appear relatively cheap. So the next time you see a \u00a370 steak, look at the item below it, which will seem like a bargain when you compare prices. William Poundstone, author of Priceless: The Myth Of Fair Value Restaurants said: 'Restaurants do not expect to sell many of these costly 'anchor' items. That is not their job \u2014 instead they are simply there to make the other dishes look like good value.' Suddenly spending \u00a321 on a plate of lemon sole doesn't seem so outlandish. Identifying body and eye language. Korean studies have shown that diners take an average of 109 seconds to read a menu. So menu consultants have a limited time to make their sell to us, which is why more expensive items of food are always place on the top right hand corner of the page (this is where the eye naturally falls when we look at a page). The most profitable dishes are usually placed there. This subliminal messaging also works in most printed matter, such as newspapers and magazines. Menu boards which omit prices (left) and classical music such as works by Beethoven (right) are some of the ways restaurants make diners pay more for their experience. Tests,which were carried out over three weeks by University of Leicester researchers, monitored the effects of classical, pop music and background silence on spending. They found that when subtle classical melodies were played, diners spent more than \u00a324 per head on average on food and drinks. When pop music was played, less than \u00a322 was spent by each diner and without any background music the spending fell to only \u00a321.70 per head. In the same test, diners were spending over \u00a31 each on coffee with classical music, compared to only 80p with pop music and 54p without any background noise. James Davis, proprietor of Softleys restaurant in Market Bosworth, where the research was carried out, said: 'The sort of music you play does affect people's mood. 'It is quite amazing how much it sets and creates an atmosphere in the restaurant. Sometimes you play what you personally like rather than what the clients like, so I think this research will definitely affect what we play in the future.' Overblown descriptive language. How much would you pay for a chicken nugget? We reckon not more than \u00a32 at most. \u00a0But what if you were presented with homemade chicken goujuns in a sesame seed crumb dusted with paprika powder and Himalayan sea salt? Then you might be more inclined to fork out in excess of \u00a37 for what is essentially a jazzed-up", "abstract": "Restaurants use various tactics to make diners spend more money, including charging fees for serving birthday cake, using hyperbole to convince customers to order pricier items, and omitting dollar signs from menus.

This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term. That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time. England manager Roy Hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up Tottenham striker Harry Kane. The Spurs front man has is a regular in the England Under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club. Kane was far from his best in the Capital One Cup final but Hodgson said he thinks the striker is'ready' It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy. Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point. 'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow. 'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is among the names for a call up to the Three Lions first team. QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form. 'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it. 'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals. 'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him? 'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn. 'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.'

Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (right) stressed as he arrived for the talks: \u2018We are here because we believe a deal can be done but it has to be a deal which puts the bomb beyond Iran's reach\u2019 After 18-months of difficult, protracted negotiations, Britain, the US, China, Russia, France and Germany are aiming to agree a political framework that would set the stage for talks on the technical details of a comprehensive accord, due by 30 June. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has campaigned vehemently against the negotiations, said in Jerusalem that the agreement being put together in Lausanne sends the message \u2018that Iran stands to gain by its aggression\u2019. The six-nation group is offering a package of relief measures, lifting the EU oil embargo and removing banking restrictions, in moves synchronised with the suspension of corresponding US sanctions. But it insists that some UN sanctions must stay in place until Iran has convinced the international community it has no intention of pursuing a weapons programme, something that could take many years. Iran appears unwilling to compromise further, its supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has left them no negotiating space insisting yesterday : \u2018Sanctions must be lifted in one go, not as a result of future Iranian actions.\u2019 A Western diplomat warned: \u2018There are still some quite important gaps,\u2019 amid warnings that \u2018an agreement is far from certain. It could all still break-up.\u2019.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, gestures as he takes a walk during a break of the new round of talks on Iran's nuclear program, in Lausanne, Switzerland today. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has been holding talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry since last Thursday, said he believed they could \u2018make the necessary progress to be able to resolve all the issues and start writing them down.\u2019 Much appears to hinge on Iran\u2019s willingness to sacrifice a considerable proportion of its 9,900 working centrifuges and export a large amount of its 7.9 tons of low-enriched uranium. The US and its European allies want a mechanism that would allow suspended UN sanctions to be put back into effect rapidly if Iran reneges on a deal. Russia reportedly accepts this, but wants to ensure its Security Council veto rights are protected. Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov announced he was to break-off from Lausanne to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate. His officials appeared more optimistic than many of an agreement. Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov (pictured right) announced he was to break-off from Lausanne to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate. Despite deep disagreements on several points, Western officials said the two sides had previously been closing in on a preliminary deal that could be summarized in a brief document which may or may not be released. Officials said the talks could run at least until the deadline of midnight on Tuesday or beyond. If there was a deal in Lausanne, the parties might move to Geneva for a ceremony. The six powers want more than a 10-year suspension of Iran's most sensitive nuclear work. Tehran, which denies it is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability, demands in exchange for limits on its atomic activities a swift end to sanctions. One sticking point concerns Iran's demand to continue with research into newer generations of advanced centrifuges that can purify uranium faster and in greater quantities than those it currently operates for use in nuclear power plants or, if very highly enriched, in weapons.", "abstract": "Negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme have stalled with the deadline for an international agreement due to expire at midnight tonight.

And with spring on its way, it's a great time to take a city break. Oxford University's Radcliffe Camera is one of the many incredible sights to visit in England this spring. OXFORD. Home to the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford has been wowing students for hundreds of years with its honey-hued domes and sky-piercing spires. Its colleges have nurtured some of the nation's greatest minds - from astronomer Edwin Hubble to playwright Oscar Wilde - but you don't have to be student to take a tour. Alternatively, follow in the footsteps of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis and sink a pint at the 17th Century The Eagle and Child. It's where their university group, the 'Inklings', used to meet to discuss literature over a tipple or two. CAMBRIDGE. With its grand buildings, historical shops and bustling market, Cambridge is just as striking as Oxford. The River Cam runs along the backs of the university - the ultimate place for punting. Visit one or two of the colleges - many are architectural marvels with centuries of history and culture to discover. The River Cam runs along the backs of the university at Cambridge - the ultimate place for punting. Trinity College is perhaps the most famous, counting Isaac Newton and Lord Byron among its alumni. Stop for lunch at The Eagle, where molecular biologist Francis Crick announced that he and James Watson had discovered the structure of DNA. LINCOLN. It's 800 years since England's most important document, Magna Carta, was sealed, and if you head to the newly restored Lincoln Castle, you can see one of only four surviving original copies of the charter in a state-of-the-art underground vault. Reopening on April 1, the refurbished castle will also have a new 360-degree walkway along its walls, letting visitors see the historical building from a new angle, and giving unprecedented access to its 18th Century prisons, as featured in television's Downton Abbey. CANTERBURY. Along with a visit to the famous cathedral, a tour of the River Stour is a must when you visit Canterbury. Canterbury was the final destination of Geoffrey Chaucer's not-so-holy pilgrims as they made their way from London to Thomas Becket's shrine in Canterbury Cathedral. The tales were written in the 14th Century, but it's still easy to imagine a fat monk or a drunken miller travelling on horseback through winding cobbled streets to what is now a Unesco World Heritage Site. Along with a visit to the famous cathedral, a tour of the River Stour is a must. From the comfort of the boat, you'll glide past gems that include a 13th Century Franciscan island, the beautiful Westgate Gardens and the King's Bridge, which dates back to 1134. BATH. Ever wondered what the Romans got up to in their lavish leisure centres? During peak summer months, you can ask your private guide to elaborate on an evening tour of one of the best-preserved Roman structures in the world. Visitors to bath can listen to famed travel writer Bill Bryson's fascinating audio commentary.

Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people after his side\u2019s match at Southend United in Essex. Football fans have already raised more than \u00a35,000 towards transport and accommodation costs for Mr Dobbin\u2019s family, who are travelling from Mildenhall, Suffolk, to visit him in Southend Hospital.

Brain damage:\u00a0Father-of-three Simon Dobbin (left), who is married to Nicole (right), 43, also suffered damaged hips, broken ribs and a broken nose in the attack - and he is now on a life-support machine. Before the trouble: Mr\u00a0Dobbin (centre) with fellow Cambridge United fans at Roots Hall for the match against Southend United on Saturday. It was\u00a0attended by 7,224 fans, including 791 supporters from Cambridge. His father-in-law Jim Faley told the Bury Free Press: \u2018If Simon doesn\u2019t come around soon, he may never wake up. We are all hoping - but in the back of our minds we are not 100 per cent sure.\u2019 \u2018Even if he comes out in a wheelchair, at least he will still be with us. There were 12 to 15 guys who came out of the pub, they were singing and dancing, and then they just jumped them. \u2018The doctors aren\u2019t holding out much hope.

Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first was due to answer bail yesterday, while the latter was bailed to May 27. Witnesses reported seeing about 20 police cars and a helicopter on Saturday night - while one fan claimed to have escorted his father and wife out of the pub's back door when the fighting began. Dan Wilson, a Southend fan who lives near the pub and witnessed the scene from his home, told MailOnline: \u2018We heard shouting coming from the pub, and saw about four guys coming out. \u2018There were guys inside the pub trying to get out, and then the guys outside the pub started chucking a billboard outside through the door. All you could hear was glass being thrown. \u2018Four guys started walking towards Prittlewell station down the hill and about 20 people ran across the road. Someone said \u201cyou've just hit my old man\u201d.

Scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet. Wild elephants benefit from walking long distances on different surfaces and rubbing their feet in abrasive dirt, but their captive peers can experience problems without these \u2018natural pedicures\u2019. Scroll down for video. Scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet (a stock image is shown) Captive elephants\u2019 feet are routinely trimmed to counter the effects of walking on unnatural ground in restricted spaces, but experts are trying to perfect the most functional pachyderm pedicure. Dr Olga Panagiotopoulou, from the University of Queensland\u2019s School of Biomedical Sciences, is working with collaborators around the world to understand how captivity influences elephant foot form and function, as well as identifying the best method of preventative foot trimming. \u2018Elephants are the largest terrestrial mammals alive today and can weigh up to eight tonnes, with their whole body mass supported by their tiny feet,\u2019 Dr Panagiotopoulou said. Wild elephants (a stock image is shown) benefit from walking long distances on various surfaces and rubbing their feet in dirt, but their captive peers can experience problems without these \u2018natural pedicures\u2019 Pressure plates were  transported to the Adventures with Elephants safari park in South Africa (pictured) to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains. \u2018We know that when these large animals walk, a huge amount of pressure is applied to their feet. Earlier this month, researchers found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Three elephants passed smell tests conducted on a game reserve in South Africa. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In a second set of tests, the elephants scored 100 percent, detecting TNT in 23 out of 23 buckets when \u2018distractor odours\u2019 such as tea, bleach, soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets, she said. It's been suggested that unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant, which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives. \u2018Preliminary data has indicated that foot pressure is more evenly distributed across the sole of the foot when the animals walk on natural grounds, but when they are walking on surfaces such as concrete the pressure is concentrated around parts of the foot that are more prone to disease, such as the lateral toes.\u2019 She said that while a range of foot-trimming procedures are followed and typically involve filing the nails and rough skin, none have been tested. Elephants' toenails typically grow between five and seven millimetetres a month. \u2018Our research involves testing different techniques to see which one will be most beneficial for the animal,\u2019 Dr Panagiotopoulou said. Working with Zebris Biomechanix in Germany, she has developed pressure platforms to measure the pressure and forces applied to elephants\u2019 feet while they are walking. \u2018The plates were recently transported to the Adventures with Elephants safari park in South Africa to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains,\u2019 she said. \u2018The elephants were trained to walk over the pressure platforms and the individual footsteps were processed using a state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique called statistical parametric mapping, which, in simple words, gives us a high-resolution image of foot pressure changes over the foot. \u2018We hope to develop smaller versions of these pressure platforms for zoo keepers and managers to use as diagnostic tools. \u2018If a captive elephant walks over a pad and a different digital pressure pattern from normal is seen, this can be investigated further.\u2019 Dr Panagiotopoulou said that early diagnosis is important because elephant foot diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteomyelitis are often diagnosed too late for treatment, meaning elephants have to be euthanized.

Police said one of the girls asked for money, according to WBAL TV. Brown, a former Temple University running back, and Eley were arrested after they arrived at the hotel with the three underage girls in their car, according to police. Court documents state that Brown told police he had met the three girls on the street and gave them a ride to a different hotel before driving them to the Best Western. Brown claimed he did not know the girls were underage or involved in prostitution and that Eley provided the car, according to charging documents. One of the girls told police that both men had known the girls were underage, according to court documents. The girl alleged Brown drove them to two meetings with two other men before they arrived at the Best Western. She claimed the girls had robbed both of the men of their money and intended to do the same at the Best Western meeting. According to court documents, the girl told police she paid Brown $300 to drive the girls around. She said Eley had given the girls condoms for their meetings. The 17-year-old girl told police that Brown was the girls' pimp and also said he knew they were underage, documents state. Brown, a former football star at Temple University (pictured), told police he had met the girls on the street that day and were unaware they were underage or involved in prostitution, according to court documents. The girls were taken into custody as human trafficking victims and were interviewed by the FBI Child Sexual Exploitation Task Force.

{"article": "(CNN)The attempts by some in the GOP to undermine President Barack Obama's Iranian policy certainly seem extraordinary. First, the Republican leadership invited Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress without consulting the White House, and he duly warned against softening of the West's line on Iran. Now, 47 senators have written an open letter to the Iranian regime to advise that any deal agreed to with Obama could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election. It is an astonishing move. But this is not, strictly speaking, unique. People in both parties have done far more remarkable things in the past. Back in 1983, Sen. Edward Kennedy tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the Soviet Union -- effectively sidestepping President Ronald Reagan. Working through proxies, he suggested that he visit Moscow to meet with the communist leadership and offered to help them make their case to the American people as to why they preferred dialogue over confrontation. As Washington Post journalist Vincent Bzdek notes in his book \"The Kennedy Legacy,\" this occurred close to a U.S. presidential election, and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy. One might argue that the senator was motivated by high ideals: He had a clear record of campaigning to reduce Cold War tensions and thought Reagan was mishandling the Soviets. On more than one occasion, Kennedy politicized foreign policy while in the Senate. In my book on the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries, I note that Kennedy opposed Jimmy Carter's hard-line stance on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan -- a position that was well-intentioned, prophetic and somewhat advantageous to Kennedy's campaign for the Democratic nomination. But it's not only Democrats who have done that. Step forward, Richard Nixon. In 1968, the presidential election looked close. With the Johnson administration edging toward a peace deal in Vietnam, Nixon's team rolled the dice. According to an account in Politico, Anna Chennault, a Republican activist, was given a message to pass onto the South Vietnamese government: If they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn, the Democrats would lose the election and Nixon as the next president would offer them better terms. The South Vietnamese indeed proved intransigent, and the Republicans won the White House. No evidence exists directly tying Nixon personally to the conspiracy, but we now know for sure that it happened and it's far hard to imagine that it would have gone ahead without his knowledge. There is a view that it bordered on treason and -- again -- makes the 2015 GOP efforts look tame by comparison. The extreme lengths that Kennedy and Nixon went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority. It's true that the spirit of the Constitution indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the President. But such harmony hasn't always been possible. Recall that Congress and the Carter White House tore themselves apart over the Panama Canal Treaties. That the Reagan administration's policy in Nicaragua was so controversial that his staffers sent aid to the rebels through back channels, and the then-Democratic House speaker, Jim Wright, was accused of presenting a private peace plan to the left-wing government. That Bill Clinton's 1994 nuclear deal with North Korea was criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. Or that liberal Democrats did their best to defund the Iraq War. As Damian Paletta writes, foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the White House through executive agreements that pass without comment. But the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is na\u00efve, and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate. The particular matter of the Iran talks is sensitive for the Republicans because it involves the electoral holy trinity of Obama, Israel and the presidential primaries. They weren't going to walk away from this one, and we can hardly be surprised that they haven't. The Democrats would do the same if the situation were reversed, as they have many times in the past. In a republic purposefully designed to have limited executive power, with a competitive two-party system bolted on to keep its politics fluid, this was arguably inevitable.", "abstract": "The recent actions of the GOP to undermine President Obama's Iranian policy are not unique, as both parties have done remarkable things in the past. For example, in 1983, Senator Edward Kennedy tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the Soviet Union, and in 1968, Richard Nixon's team rolled the dice by giving a message to the South Vietnamese government to undermine peace talks. Foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority, and the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is na\u00efve."}

The mother-in-law of Rugby World Cup winner Ben Cohen is to stand trial accused of harassing the Strictly Come Dancing star. Felicity Bassouls is accused of persistently emailing and phoning the former England player between September and October last year. Bassouls, 67, turned up for a hearing of the case at Northampton Magistrates' Court today, but had not been called on to attend. A three-day trial was set down to start at Corby Magistrates' Court on August 12, with the agreement of defence lawyers and the Crown Prosecution Service. Bassouls, of Ardross, near Alness in Highland, Scotland, is also accused of harassing her own son, Austen Blaney, with emails and phone calls, between September 1 and October 29. She was unconditionally bailed after the hearing. Asked if she had any comment to make outside court, Bassouls said: 'I have nothing to say at this time.' Cohen split with his wife Abby  but denied that it was due to a relationship with his Strictly Come Dancing on-screen partner Kristina Rihanoff. The BBC show is said to have a 'curse' with its steamy routines believed to have a hand in ending celebrities' relationships. Cohen is pictured with his wife Abby in 2003 at the International Rugby Board Awards - they split last year. Bassouls, Cohen's mother-in-law, was unconditionally bailed and offered no comment outside the court. Cohen poses with the Rugby World Cup that he won as a member of England's squad in 2003 in Australia. At the time of the split, Cohen said: 'It is a sad world when two adults cannot have a friendship.' The athlete and activist, who was part of England's 2003 World Cup winning squad, had been married to Abby for 11 years and the couple have twin daughters. Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008.

{"article": "Monisha Kaltenborn has no intention of quitting as team principal of Sauber despite being mired in legal controversy this week. Kaltenborn's position has been drawn into sharp focus after appearing to have signed three drivers for the new Formula One season, but with naturally only two seats available. The case with reserve driver Giedo van der Garde is to continue at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Saturday, just a few miles from the Albert Park circuit. Monisha Kaltenborn addresses the media in Melbourne on Friday with her team mired in controversy. Felipe Nasr takes to the Albert Park track during the second practice session for the Australian Grand Prix. Kaltenborn, a trained lawyer, was naturally unable to shed any light on the case given it remains ongoing. But asked whether she was still competent to run the team, Kaltenborn replied: 'I don't see it (the case) having any effect. 'We have a very clear view of what we did. We took action after thinking about it for a while. 'For us that was very clear, but the outcome is different, and that's all I can say to you.' Pressed on whether she had considered resigning, Kaltenborn added: 'I've not considered that. Giedo van der Garde walks through the Sauber team garage as his legal dispute with the team continues. Lewis Hamilton in action for Mercedes as the champions continued where they left off by setting the pace. 'This whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work, the way the team works.' Kaltenborn conceded, however, the past week had affected morale with the team's name dragged through the courts. 'It's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was, for a while, unclear,' added Kaltenborn. 'We now have certain actions taken against the team, and we are acting accordingly. There's nothing much more really I can say to that.' The Supreme Court initially upheld a Swiss arbitration panel decision that the team not deny Van der Garde his right to drive given the 29-year-old has a contract for a full-time seat for this season. Swedish driver Marcus Ericsson was also in action for Sauber under the blazing sun in Melbourne. Van der Garde is now pursuing enforcement of the order allowing him to drive, otherwise Sauber risk being in contempt of court. At one stage during the day bailiffs were on stand-by outside the circuit ready to impound Sauber's assets, namely the cars and trackside equipment. Sauber's problem is they also signed Marcus Ericcson and Felipe Nasr towards the end of last year before cancelling Van der Garde's deal in February, according to Kaltenborn. With three valid contracts and only two race seats available, Sauber and Kaltenborn have found themselves mired in controversy. Sauber have been forced to detail their assets to the court, whilst the worst-case scenario for Kaltenborn is she faces imprisonment if she fails to comply with the order. The legal argument resulted in Sauber failing to take to the track for the opening practice session of the year at Melbourne's Albert Park. Come FP2, with lawyers for both parties back in court at the same time, it was Ericsson and Nasr behind the wheel, with Van der Garde unable to acquire in time a super licence required to drive in F1. Asked as to why they were unable to take part in FP1 yet did so in FP2, she replied: 'It's a topic which I cannot talk about. That's all I can say.' In court, Justice Croft ordered a further recess until 9.30am local time Saturday (10.30pm UK), with constructive talks understood to have taken place, leading to the possibility of a conclusion.", "abstract": "Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn has stated that she has no intention of quitting her role despite the legal controversy surrounding the team.

{"article": "For desperate Chinese families whose children suffer from debilitating brain conditions such as cerebral palsy, there is only one place to go. Those who have little or no money to pay for treatment flock to a ramshackle village in Changsha, one of China's fastest-growing cities, which has sprung up in the shadow of a specialist hospital. The community has become known as the 'brain paralysis village', as families from around the country set up home there in the hope of receiving crucial treatment than can improve the quality of life for their children, according to a report on People's Daily. Father and daughters: Village resident Zhu Dongwen (middle) and his twin daughters, who were born in 2011. Hundreds have moved there - spending upwards of \u00a5100 (\u00a310.6) per month on rent - because the treatment at the nearby\u00a0Xiangya Bo'ai Rehabilitation Hospital is completely free, as it is funded by a government scheme. Roughly 10 kilometres from the Changsha Railway Station, the village has formed spontaneously, as desperate families arrive to seek medical advice from the largest rehabilitation hospital in central China. The free service is only open to parents who have run out of money and no longer have any other way of getting help for children who suffer from serious brain problems. Zhu Dongwen, 43, is one of the many parents living in this village. Both of his twin daughters, born in 2011, suffer from brain paralysis. 'I never found out what that really meant, or why it happened, although I spent all my savings looking for an answer and looking for a cure,' said Mr Zhu. 'In the end we were turned out on the street and in desperation in April last year I managed to get taken in here. I had almost run out of hope, but the community gave me back my hope.' Mr Zhu came to the village with \u00a51,000 (\u00a3106) in his pocket in April 2013. Although the treatment is free-of-charge, the families still need money to live off. Now a full-time carer for daughters Zhu Sihui and Zhu Siying (not their real names) without any stable income, Mr Zhu is spending around \u00a53,000 (\u00a3318) to support the family's life in the village. He took out a loan of more than \u00a5250,000 (\u00a326,422) from various sources, which was spent on seeking care for his daughters, according to another report onChina Daily. Road to recovery: Both of Mr Zhu's daughters are recovering slowly. In the picture, Mr Zhu is dressing his  Zhu Siying while Zhu Sihui is warming up her hands near the fire. Inside hospital: Mother Wang Qun is helping her daughter Xiang Liping with rehabilitation. Under the intense treatment being carried out at the centre, the first of his daughters recovered enough control over her body to be able to walk. A month later his second daughter followed suit, and now they are able to interact with him and carry out many tasks that would have been impossible a year ago. Mr Zhu said: 'I am finally starting to believe that my girls will now be able to live relatively normal lives and even if something should happen to me they will be able to look after themselves one day.\u00a0It is an impossible dream come true and all thanks to the chance I had to come here.' The project is unique to the area and it is not clear where the funding comes from, but children get rooms and care on-site. And with his daughters' care in hand, Zhu Dongwen is even able to do some work locally to start to save again and build a future for them all outside of the village once they are well enough to leave. He said: 'I have hope again and it is this place that has given us that hope.' Treatment in demand: A governmental report suggested that there are around 20,000 children with some form of 'brain paralysis' in Hunan Province in southern China. The village: Housing around 100 families, the neighbourhood is located close to a major hospital offering a scheme which gives free treatment to children with\u00a0brain paralysis. According to People's Daily, the scheme plans to help 9,000 such children under seven years old in Hunan. All of the children are classified as critical when they arrive, and most of them are unable to do anything for themselves.

{"article": "It is one of the world's best loved musicals - the true story of a novice nun who falls in love with a widower and his seven children. From Julie Andrews waltzing through the Alps to seven children behaving perfectly,  The Sound of Music might look like it portrays the family everyone wants. But Andrews' real life counterpart - Maria Kutschera - was far from the idealized mother the popular film portrays. In fact she was a difficult Austrian woman plagued by insecurities. Scroll down for video. Maria Kutschera (centre) was far from the idealized mother The Sound of Music portrays, her son has revealed in a new book. Whereas Julie Andrews (above) waltzed carelessly through the Alps in the 1965 film, Maria was described by her son Johannes as 'incredibly strong' with 'literally an indomitable will' Her son Johannes has now revealed all in a new book written by Tom Santopietro. He said: 'She was  incredibly strong with a formidable will, literally an indomitable will. 'And sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant.' The 75-year-old added that his mother was very complex and admitted that she was unhappy as a child. Maria was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents' village in Tyrol to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, on a train. By the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle. Maria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the Nonnberg Abbey, in Salzburg, intending to become a nun. But while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed man, who was left with seven children after his first wife Agatha died of scarlet fever. That man was Georg von Trapp. They would quickly become married and have three more children. Georg von Trapp was previously the commander of Austrian submarine U5. He is pictured with his fianc\u00e9e Agathe Whitehead. The Von Trapp family are pictured in 1939. Top row: Werner and Rupert; Second row: Dr. Franz Wasner, Johanna, Martina, Maria and Georg, Johannes, Hedwig, Maria; Bottom: Agathe, Rosmarie and Eleonore. The family, including Andrews (centre), perform a song in the film. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children who does not feature in the film, said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that' It was not long before Maria founded a family choir. Although the children sang together before she joined them, they remember her particularly pushing  public performances - especially after Georg lost his fortune. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children, often found her mother particularly difficult. She said it got worse after her father died in 1947. 'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it,' Boudicca Fox-Leonard of the\u00a0Sunday People\u00a0reported her saying. The now 87-year-old said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.' In real life, after fleeing the country in 1938 the von Trapp's came to rely on their musical performances for money. She also recounts Maria sending her for shock therapy after she had a breakdown and said she locked step-daughter Johanna in a room for announcing she was getting married. After fleeing the country  in 1938, the family - known as the Trapp Family Singers in the US - came to rely on the performances for money. The popular film was made after Broadway found a book  detailing the family's adventurers. Maria later sold the rights  to Hollywood for \u00a33,000. But director Robert Wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her.' Even director\u00a0Robert Wise rebuffed Maria's attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her' Only three children, none of which feature in the film, survive. The last surviving von Trapp singer died in early 2014. Four of the couple's great-grandchildren are still attempting to keep the tradition alive. Sofi, Melanie, Amanda, and their younger brother August have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together. They can remember little of their great-grandmother. Sofi said: 'We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group. 'The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.'

Father-of-two Cllr Jo Stephenson, 59, who was Lib Dem deputy leader of Cumbria County Council, died in hospital three weeks later from internal injuries. His wife Hilary told the inquest he had been under considerable pressure in the weeks before his death to push through the later-abandoned policy of fresh on-street parking across Cumbria. It was initially thought Mr Stephenson had accidentally fallen from his roof while carrying out some DIY on his Lake Windermere home in July last year. But Kendal Coroner's Court was told after hitting the ground Mr Stephenson dialled 999 - and admitted to the call handler he had thrown himself off on purpose. He then discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home, as well as with staff at the Royal Preston Hospital, the inquest heard. The former Lakes School teacher was said to have been 'deeply distressed' by 'personal attacks' made towards him over the internet. These came as a result of the move to impose a parking tariff in 11 towns including Carlisle, Penrith, Cockermouth and Keswick. The plans were not introduced following a consultation that identified concerns about the inadequacy of the  enforcement regime. This resulted in him appearing 'distracted' in the fortnight before the incident. While in hospital the councillor suffered what was described as a 'psychotic episode' - attacking a pregnant nurse with a butter knife. Mental health consultant Dr Richard Morgan confirmed Mr Stephenson 'lashed out' at the pregnant nurse. He said the councillor also injured his own eye with the arm of his glasses and said he wished the attempt upon his life had been successful. Mr Stephenson's wife argued he was terrified, sleep-deprived and affected by medication at the time. She added she did not believe Mr Stephenson deliberately tried to end his life. He died on 25 July from a pulmonary embolism and bronchial pneumonia, with a stroke as a secondary factor. Giving a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Alan Sharpe stopped short of ruling Mr Stephenson had intended to take his own life but said the fall was 'no accident'. He discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home, as well as with staff at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured), the inquest heard. The South Cumbria deputy coroner stressed that while Mr Stephenson had told medics he had intended to take his own life, it was not certain he was thinking clearly at the time of his fall. He added: 'It's quite clear Jo Stephenson was very well-loved and liked and had lived a very successful life. 'It's quite clear from the transcript of the 999 call and from the evidence given by the paramedic that it was not an accident when he fell from the roof. 'Whatever his state of mind - he did jump.' His widow Hilary told the hearing despite the attacks he received in the months before his death, she had no regrets about him entering politics. Last year Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg led the tributes to respected Mr Stephenson. Mr Clegg said: 'I am very sad to hear of the death of Jo Stephenson, a much-loved and dedicated councillor and a great servant of his community. Prime Minister Nick Clegg led the tributes to Mr Stephenson describing him as a'much-loved and dedicated councillor' 'He is a real loss to the Lib Dem family and will be greatly missed. 'My thoughts are with his family and friends at this awful time.' Mr Stephenson, who had previously worked as a solicitor and teacher, also ran a B&B near the scenic Lake Windermere, in Cumbria, and was a former leader of South Lakeland District Council. Labour Cllr Stewart Young said: 'We are all enormously shocked by this very sad news. 'I worked very closely with Jo since the 2013 elections and found him to be a very decent and honourable man. He will be thoroughly missed.' Clare Feeney-Johnson, a friend of Mr Stephenson and a fellow Lib Dem cabinet member, was also devastated by his death. She added: 'Jo was an inspiration for many of us and gave up so much of his time and resources in order to try and make Windermere and Cumbria a better place. 'All of our thoughts are with Hilary and his family at this very distressing time.' Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for the South Lakes, said: 'Jo was a wonderful councillor, colleague and friend. 'He got involved in local politics, giving up a career in law because he wanted to make a difference to the community he loved.'

Ukip last night said Janice Atkinson and her assistant Christine Hewitt had been kicked out for \u2018bringing the party into disrepute\u2019. A disciplinary hearing was held yesterday following allegations that Miss Hewitt had obtained a \u00a33,150 invoice for a drinks party that cost \u00a3950 in a bid to \u2018repatriate\u2019 extra money from the EU. Scroll down for video. Ukip  said Janice Atkinson (pictured) \u00a0and her assistant had been kicked out for \u2018bringing the party into disrepute\u2019 Miss Atkinson, who is an MEP for the South East, had also been due to stand at the General Election as the candidate for the Folkestone and Hythe constituency. Police last week launched an investigation into allegations over the women\u2019s event hosted by Mrs Atkinson at Ukip\u2019s spring conference in Margate, Kent. Guests at the party, which was attended by Nigel Farage\u2019s wife Kirsten, drank champagne, cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine. The event reportedly cost \u00a3950 and was paid by Mrs Atkinson\u2019 chief of staff Christine Hewitt on credit card, but she later returned to the restaurant and was given an invoice for \u00a33,150. Mr Farage said last week that he was 'deeply shocked' by the allegations and described it as 'one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life' She was allegedly filmed telling an undercover reporter: \u2018The idea is we overcharge them slightly because that\u2019s the way of repatriating (the money).\u2019 Nigel Farage was left reeling last week after losing three election candidates in less than 24 hours. The Ukip leader was left 'deeply shocked' after suspending MEP Janice Atkinson. Hours later the party confirmed a second senior figure, the party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, had been suspended following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'. The final blow came when the party's candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Jonathan Stanley, sensationally quit claiming he was sick of the 'open racism and bullying' in the party. Mr Farage last week said: \u2018I was deeply shocked when I saw it. It was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I've ever seen in my life.\u2019 The party yesterday held a disciplinary hearing chaired independently by somebody from the legal profession with representatives of the national executive of Ukip. Last night in a statement, Mrs Atkinson said: 'I am deeply disappointed by today\u2019s decision and fully intend to appeal. \u2018I was elected to represent the constituents of the south-east of England and I will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf and for the best interests of our country.' A Ukip spokesman said: \u2018Janice Atkinson MEP and Christine Hewitt, assistant to Janice Atkinson, have been found to have brought the party into disrepute. \u2018As a result they have been expelled from the UK Independence Party. They have 14 days to appeal. \u2018This means that Ms Atkinson no longer represents UKIP in the European Parliament and she will no longer be our prospective parliamentary candidate for Folkestone and Hythe.\u2019 Mrs Atkinson, pictured with Nigel Farage as the South East England region results of the European Parliament elections were declared last year, was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011.

The 52-year-old found herself in hot water last year after she was recorded by TV cameras calling the wife of a Ukip supporter \u2018a ting tong from somewhere\u2019. She insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was \u2018incredibly sorry\u2019 for offending the woman. In December it emerged that she owed more than \u00a32,000 in child support to her ex-husband despite previously criticising \u2018feckless families\u2019 who have more children than they can afford.

{"article": "(CNN)He's a Rolls Royce footballer who honed his game in his parents' garage. And even at the age of 40, former Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero is still purring along, showing no signs of running out of gas. The record-breaking striker is currently enjoying an Indian summer to his football career, completing stints at Sydney FC in Australia and more recently at the Delhi Dynamos in the inaugural Indian Super League. Inevitably, the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that doesn't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he's still enjoying himself so much. \"About football, I love every single moment -- the life with teammates, the atmosphere before a game, the free kicks, the goals. I love every moment like the first one,\" Del Piero told CNN's Human to Hero series. The man dubbed \"Il Pinturicchio\" (\"the little artist\") has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in Italy. During 19 seasons at Juventus he won 15 trophies including six Serie A crowns and a European Champions League title, as well as setting club records for appearances and goals. In all, Del Piero made 705 appearances for the Bianconeri -- including a record 478 in Serie A -- and scored 289 goals along the way. \"I'm very proud about the records because I do everything for the club. I've had some great moments with the club, with the fans (and) with my teammates,\" he says. Raised in the town of Conegliano in northern Italy, Del Piero's love for football was fostered by his late father, Gino. \"My childhood was fantastic. I trained and played every moment and in every space of my home,\" he recalls. \"You know northern Italy is very cold -- you cannot play outside, so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space. I would play alone, with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer.\" Del Piero turned professional at the age of 17, joining Serie B side Padova in 1991 before being snapped up by Juventus for \u20ac2.6 million two years later. His longstanding relationship with the \"Old Lady,\" as Juventus is affectionately known, got off on the right foot almost from the start. Del Piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year, becoming a first-team regular standing in for injured star striker Roberto Baggio. The two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level, with both netting 27 times for their country, but their defining moments for the Azzurri could not have been more contrasting. While Baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed Brazil victory in the 1994 FIFA World Cup final, Del Piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football's biggest stage. After being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002, Del Piero and Italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in Germany, beating France on penalties in a final remembered primarily for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi. Victory in the final was a \"beautiful\" moment but Del Piero's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier. \"The most special moment in my head, and probably the heads of my teammates, was the semifinal,\" he says. \"Definitely the final, when you take the cup and lift it to the sky, it's beautiful. But the semifinal was the most exciting. We played the home team for 120 minutes. There is a big connection between our two countries. It was incredible.\" An epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes, with extra time going the same way, before Fabio Grosso netted in the 119th minute followed by a Del Piero effort moments later. \"I can't hide that my greatest victory is the World Cup. Since you're a kid you think you want to win that. It was massive,\" he says. Italy's third World Cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in Italy's domestic league as Juventus and other Serie A teams were implicated in the \"Calciopoli\" match-fixing scandal. The repercussions would see former Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi banned for life by the Italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two Serie A titles won in 2005 and 2006, relegated to Serie B and docked nine points. The demotion to Italy's second tier saw some top players leave the club, including Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, France defender Lilian Thuram and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But the ever-faithful Del Piero stayed put, helping Juventus secure the Serie B title and an immediate return to the top flight. \"I think that staying with Juventus in Serie B, even before I knew how large the points penalty was going to be, was", "abstract": "Alessandro Del Piero, former Juventus star, is still playing football at the age of 40 and is currently playing for the Delhi Dynamos in the Indian Super League.

But his manager was less than impressed that the video was leaked. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney re-enacted a video of him boxing a former team-mate. Louis van Gaal claims the world is 'twisted' after the story appeared in the Sun on Sunday. Rooney punched the air, before falling backwards in a similar fashion to what can be seen in the video. Rooney manages to keep a straight face as he falls directly backwards onto the Old Trafford turf. 'I think it is a ridiculous world where we live that I have to answer questions (like that),' the Dutchman said. 'What is this world, twisted? I don't want to answer questions about such things.' Rooney enjoyed his goal celebration but was keen to play down the story and bemoaned the fact it had reached the public domain. Bardsley's wife Tanya had also tweeted that the video was a joke between the pair. The England captain stretches his hands out behind him to break his fall as he hits the ground. Rooney was joined by laughing team-mates as he fell on the ground during his celebration. For a few seconds, Rooney lay on the Old Trafford pitch with his arms spread wide while being congratulated. 'That's the world we live in today. It's in my own home, it's not public, it's what friends do - they mess around in the house,' the United captain told Sky Sports. 'It was a couple of mates in a private house, and somehow it's managed to get on the front page of a national newspaper.' Rooney took advantage of a misplaced pass by Nabil Bentaleb and bundled his way past two Spurs players before scoring the third and final goal of a hugely successful afternoon for United. Rooney, 29, insisted the publication of the story did not distract him in the build-up to the game. He said: 'I've just been focused on the game, it's more interesting for other people rather than for me. You've seen today, I've done a professional job and helped my team win 3-0.' Midfielder Michael Carrick revealed after the match that he and his team-mates had poked fun at Rooney over the episode. 'He got a little bit of stick,' Carrick said.

{"article": "Apple CEO Tim Cook still remembers the last movie he ever saw with Steve Jobs before he succumbed to cancer: the sentimental football flick Remember the Titans. 'I was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie,' Cook recalls in the new biography 'Becoming Steve Jobs,' out in bookstores now. The 2000 film starring Denzel Washington tells the true story of a newly integrated Virginia high school football team in 1971. Scroll down for video. Heir: Tim Cook (left) was tapped by Steve Jobs as his successor in August 2011, just months before the co-founder of Apple succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Here the two are pictured at a press conference on antenna problems with the iPhone4 at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, July 16, 2010. Movie night to remember: In the new biography 'Becoming Jobs,' Cook recalls how six days before Jobs died, he invited his over to watch the sentimental 2000 football flick Remember the Titans (pictured) 'I was like, \"Are you sure?\" Steve was not interested in sports at all. And we watched and we talked about a number of things and I left thinking that he was pretty happy,' according to a CNN review of the book. Six days after Cook and Jobs' movie night, the co-founder of Apple passed away at his Palo Alto, California, estate from complications related to pancreatic cancer. He was 56 years old. The new biography of the late Apple CEO by veteran tech journalists Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli traces his decades-long evolution from a'reckless' young inventor tinkering with early computer models into the leader of a global tech giant. The book, based on numerous in-depth interviews with Jobs' colleagues, friends and competitors, also allows a glimpse into the Apple CEO's inner sanctum in the final weeks of his life. Cook, who took the reins of Apple in August 2011, less than two months before his mentor's death, described to the authors of the biography the moment Jobs invited him over to his house to offer him the top job. \u2018He told me he had decided that I should be CEO. I thought then that he thought he was going to live a lot longer when he said this, because we got into a whole level of discussion about what would it mean for me to be CEO with him as a chairman. Evolution of a genius: The new tome (left), penned by a pair of tech journalists, traces Jobs' transformation from a brash young inventor (right) into a a 'visionary leader' Music fan: Jobs, pictured here in 1977, loved the Beatles, with John Lennon being his favorite member of the band. He even reportedly named his company after the band's Apple Corps Record. \u2018I asked him, \u201cWhat do you really not want to do that you\u2019re doing?\u201d Cook recalled. \u2018He says, \u201cYou make all the decisions.\u201d I go, \u201cWait. Let me ask you a question.\u201d \u2018I tried to pick something that would incite him. So I said, \u201cYou mean that if I review an ad and I like it, it should just run without your okay?\u201d And he laughed and said, \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019d at least ask me!\u201d\u2019 Cook said that every time he visited Jobs, his boss appeared to be on the mend, and he asked him two or three times whether his decision to step down as the CEO was final. Jobs never wavered. According to Tim Cook, his boss wanted a successor who would not try to copy his style of leadership but rather use his own talents for the good of the company - a model he referred to as a 'Beatles concept,' named after Liverpool's Fab Five. In an interesting titbit, the book reveals that Jobs' favorite Beatle was John Lennon, and that he reportedly named his company after Beatles' Apple Corps Record. Stepping down: Cook said that every time he visited Jobs, his boss appeared to be on the mend, and he asked him two or three times whether his decision to step down as the CEO was final.

In the weeks leading up to his passing, Jobs also met up with John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar, the award-winning digital animation company founded by Jobs and later sold to Disney for $7billion. \u2018We talked all about Pixar... And then I kinda looked at him and he said, \u201cYeah I need to get a nap now.\u201d I got up to go, and then I stopped, and I looked at him and came back.

In a show of defiance Ms Hirschowitz posted a picture to Twitter on Monday of her  happily cooking a laksa without the assistance of the Thermomix, instead she used a run of the mill pot. #thermogate ended with Ms Hirschowitz posting a photo of her happily cooking without the Thermomix. This wasn\u2019t the first instance the Thermomix came under public scrutiny with social media\u00a0backlash\u00a0after a new model was released in Australia without 'appropriate warning.' Customers said they felt duped after buying the substandard model only days or weeks before the upgrade was released. Australian comedy duo Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney also lampooned the Thermomix as part of their parody cooking series 'The Katering Show'. In the video, which has almost 1.5 million views on Youtube, the pair describe the $2,000 appliance as'something you buy because you've always wanted to join a cult, but don\u2019t have the energy for group sex\u2019 or it's 'the kind of a appliance that your rich mother-in-law gives you as a wedding gift, because she doesn't think you can cook'. The Thermomix was first launched in Australia back in 2001 with some 80,000 units being sold in 2014 alone.

So Italian engineers at Italdesign Giugiaro have teamed up with Audi and Technogym to get car owners to exercise when they\u2019re stuck in traffic. The result is a high-end self-driving electric car with basic gym equipment built into the seats and floor, a fridge for drinks and a Wellness mode. Italdesign Giugiaro has created the world\u2019s first autonomous electric car with gym equipment built into the seats and floor.\u00a0Two handles are fitted into the rear seats and pop out of their compartment at the press of a button. For lower limbs, two flat boards designed by Technogym\u00a0have been fitted to the floor. The concept model is called Gea and was presented at Geneva's 85th International Motor Show this week. It is dubbed 'the future of luxury mobility.' It has so-called 'book-type' doors that can be opened remotely and beam a red carpet from the car onto the floor. Two aluminium handles designed by Technogym are fitted into the rear seats. By activating a sensor, the handles pop out of the compartment and can be used for upper body routines. Senzati recently unveiled its luxuriously modified Jet Sprinter van. Its layout and features, such as the colour of the seats, can be customised. It boasts a 6.5ft (two metre) sunroof, luxury bathroom, office, fridge and entertainment system - among other features - depending on the specification. The vehicle was built by Coventry-based Senzati and is based on Mercedes\u2019 Sprinter van, sometimes used by tradesmen. It set out to design a vehicle to provide passengers with \u2018the space uniquely found in a decent sized private jet\u2019 that is able to be manoeuvred in cities and be discrete from the exterior. The vehicle starts at \u00a3209,000 ($318,000) and is made to look discrete from the outside. For lower limbs, two flat boards have been fitted to the floor. These can be made to be raised and used for stepping exercises. And a built-in monitor displays a video tutorial of Technogym exercise routines to help the user vary their workouts. There is also room between the seats for a small fridge where drinks  can be stored. And at the top to this compartment, a small drawer contains cosmetics and a perfumed pouch for aromatherapy. Elsewhere, when the driver selects Wellness mode dashboard LED lights turn to amber to create a \u2018warmer, more relaxing atmosphere\u2019. A Business mode turns the Gea into a mobile office with two 19-inch screens that drop from the roof to let passengers choose what information is shown. The front passenger seat can also turn through 180 degrees to hold meetings on the move. And in Dream mode the front seats join and fold-out to add a footrest, while the right rear seat can turn into a fully flat bed. LEDs project a relaxing blue light, the windows darken and  pictures of galaxies and starry skies appear on the monitors and on the front dashboard.

Tribal leaders involved in negotiations with al Qaeda over the last month handed Abdullah Al Khalidi to Saudi authorities on Monday, two Yemeni government officials said. Unknown gunmen kidnapped Al Khalidi, the Saudi deputy consular, in 2012 as he was leaving his residence in the Mansoora district of Yemen's business capital of Aden. He was later handed over to al Qaeda, where he appeared in al Qaeda video last year pleading to the Saudi government to ensure his safe release. Al Qaeda was demanding a ransom for his release and threatened to kill him if the ransom was not paid. CNN was not able to confirm whether Saudi Arabia or his family paid a ransom in exchange for his release. A Yemeni Foreign Ministry official told CNN that his government was not involved in the negotiations for Al Khalidi's release. \"The Yemeni government does not negotiate with terrorists. Ransoms that are paid to terrorists motivates them to conduct more kidnappings,\" said the official on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. The Saudi Interior Ministry announced Monday that Al Khalidi reached Riyadh safely and is undergoing medical checkups. Al Khalidi had been living in Aden for four years when he was kidnapped. Last week, a Frenchwoman working for an international organization was kidnapped, along with her Yemeni translator, in Sanaa. Two four-wheel drive vehicles were used in the kidnapping attempt, according to eyewitnesses. Their whereabouts remain unknown. Kidnappings of foreigners is common in Yemen with tribes or al Qaeda-linked militants often demanding a ransom for their release or using them as a bargaining chip in their dealings with the central government. Al Qaeda is believed to have been behind most of the kidnappings since 2012. Gunmen kidnapped an Iranian diplomat, Ahmed Bakht, in Yemen in 2013, and his whereabouts are still unknown. Bakht was an Iranian national employed within the Iranian Embassy in Yemen and was kidnapped while traveling through the diplomatic quarter in Sanaa when gunmen blocked the road ahead of him and abducted him.", "abstract": "Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has released a Saudi diplomat who was kidnapped three years ago.

Many Australians have called for a boycott of the island paradise in anger at the imminent killings. The island hosts more than a million Australian tourists each year, including the prime minister. But Mr Abbott told WSFM's Jonesy and Amanda on Friday that he would not boycott Bali. 'I am one of those Australians who has been several times to Bali on holidays,' Mr Abbott said.\u00a0'I've got to say I love my time there.' Scroll down for video.

'I would hate to think that our understandable dismay and disappointment and even anger at the prospect of these executions... would permanently blight the relationship, because it's too important to both our countries.' Mr Abbott provoked anger from Indonesian officials in February after he publicly reminded them the Federal Government had donated $1 billion of aid to the country following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The tsunami devastated the country's Aceh province and the Australian government deployed military personnel to assist in humanitarian relief operations. Mr Abbott's aid statement was dismissed by an Indonesian foreign ministry official - who told reporters 'no one responds well to threats'.

'Take Back All Money & S**t You Gave Us!' one Twitter user said, posting a picture of a jar of coins. Mr Abbott said on Friday that he hoped to make more progress with Indonesia with private, rather than public conversations.

The flights last November don't include more than a dozen other trips on donors' planes that Schock has paid for out of his House office expenses or campaign funds since joining Congress in 2009. Schock, a 33-year-old Republican representing Peoria, had already been facing scrutiny for using congressional funds to redecorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show 'Downton Abbey.' He repaid those charges last month out of his own pocket; his office had said it's reviewing other expenses. Rep. Aaron Schockis accused of billing taxpayers for more than $10,000 on private flights last fall that included a trip to a Chicago Bears football game. Schock and his entourage flew in an Eclipse 500 aircraft like this one. The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday night that Schock flew from Peoria, Illinois to Chicago to attend a Bears game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 16, 2014. Overall, according to the paper, he used $20,855 in taxpayer money for the Chicago trip and another to New York in September, where his political action committee spent another $3,000 for tickets to the Global Citizen Festival concert. This week Schock reportedly hired a pair of lawyers to audit his political and legislative operations. Spokesmen for Schock declined to comment to the Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune, and did not respond to a request from Daily Mail Online. In a statement last week they said a legal team was already poring over 'compliance procedures in his official office, campaign and leadership PAC to determine whether they can be improved.' The football game was part of a longer trip on a chartered six-seat business jet that took off from a civil aviation airport in Manassas, Virginia en route to Peoria on a Friday. The Bears defeated the Vikings but the game may ultimately defeat a congressman. DOWNTON OFFICE: Schock spent $40,000 in taxpayer funds redecorating his Capitol Hill office, but had to pay the money back. The Sunday trip was a sideline before the aircraft returned to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport a day later. All the seats were filled, according to pilot Keith Siilats, who told the Sun-Times that Schock's district director Dayne LaHood and three others were aboard. He also said he accompanied the congressman and his group to the football game. He was paid $10,802 for 'commercial transportation' in November, the last month for which numbers are available. 'That whole weekend was paid by the government,' he said. Schock 'called me on Saturday and said \"what do you think about\u2019 a Chicago trip?\"' Siilats recalled for the paper.

{"article": "As the days countdown to Saturday\u2019s NSW State Election, politicians are using every way they can to gain votes, and one of these is to advertise on gay hook-up app, Grindr. Labor\u2019s Penny Sharpe, who is looking to become a member of the Legislative Assembly, and Sydney state independent MP Alex Greenwich are both using the app in a bid to get as many votes as possible. The two gay politicians are following up on the example set by Greens candidate Sam Hibbins who won a seat in Prahran in November\u2019s Victorian state election. Labor\u2019s Penny Sharpe (left) and\u00a0Sydney state independent MP Alex Greenwich (right) are using the Grindr app to reach out to the electorate. Hibbins was one of Australia\u2019s first politicians to use hook-up apps as a method to reach voters successfully. He used the Grindr app to send political messages to members of Melbourne\u2019s Prahran electorate, living in the suburbs of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra and St Kilda East, as the candidate campaigns ahead of the election. The Star Observer\u00a0reports that Sharpe was using the app on a trial basis for this election. 'It\u2019s not a space I play in regularly,' said Ms Sharpe, who is standing as Labor\u2019s candidate in the inner west seat of Newtown. Ms Sharpe and Mr\u00a0Greenwich both placed ads on Grindr to encourage people to vote for them. 'But I\u2019m sure that some of my volunteers have profiles. 'For us, it\u2019s a totally new way of talking to people and we know there are lots of people who aren\u2019t as engaged.' Mr Greenwich also said that it was the first time that he had used the app to reach out to the electorate.\u00a0But if it proved successful he wouldn\u2019t rule out using other apps in the future. Ms Sharpe\u2019s ads were paid for out of her campaign funds while Mr Greenwich\u2019s is courtesy of campaign group Out For. Grindr is a smartphone app to facilitate casual sex for gay men. However, it was Mr Hibbins who was the original trailblazer. \u2018This election we're using Grindr to reach voters in Prahran,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page before the Victorian state election last November. 'We'll be using it to promote events, our support for equality and broader policies.' Mr Hibbins believed that although he was the first to use the strategy in Australia, the idea would take off as a popular campaign approach. Sam Hibbins used Grindr to send targeted messages to the homosexual community in his electorate in Prahan ahead of last November's state election in Victoria. Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters. Dutch politician Jan-Bert Vroege used the app to campaign in March last year. He did not use pop up messages like Mr Hibbins however, rather transforming his own pre-existing Grindr account, changing his profile description to: \u2018let\u2019s have a date on March 19\u2019 to promote a political event about gay issues.

{"article": "In the last decade, thousands of British teenagers have celebrated their 'graduation' from secondary school by hiring a limousine to travel to their prom in style. But it seems that they have nothing on their Mexican peers. A series of fascinating new photographs highlight a trend in the city of Monterrey for throwing extravagant parties to mark the point at which young girls turn 15 and, according to Latin American tradition, transition into womanhood. Sofia, 15, is just one of many teens who marked her coming of age - or 'quincea\u00f1era' - by riding in not one, but several, super-bling limos with gaggles of friends, wearing matching suits and party frocks, joining in the fun. Scroll down for video. It's my party! Young Sofia, 15, is pictured wearing a flamenco-style cerise dress riding in an open-top SUV-limo hybrid. The glammed-up teen celebrated her\u00a0quincea\u00f1era - transition into womanhood - with a lavish party. Is it a car, is it a nightclub? Another teen, Ariadna, smiles as she takes a seat in a lavender limo, which comes with shiny ceiling and strip lighting - perfect for partying teens. Parties to mark a girl's quincea\u00f1era have become increasingly lavish with parents splashing out huge sums to ensure their youngster has a party to remember. However, it isn't just 'bank of mum and dad' that pays for the event, other relatives are called upon to'sponsor' certain elements, for example, the cake or the DJ. Such is the pomp and ceremony of these excessive bashes, you could be forgiven for thinking that you're looking at a garish wedding party. Even the attending boys go to town, taking care to coordinate their looks with the birthday girl. Much like the American prom, the celebrating girl can expect a date, with her betrothed often appearing like a mini-groom, wearing an outfit that has been planned to match hers. The birthday cake is likely to be just as eye-catching with 'the bigger, the better' the remit. Other trends include hiring a choreographer to make sure everything from the girl's entrance into the room to her first dance has a professional touch. Open the roof and let's go! Partygoers climb inside the SUV-limo hybrid as guests make their way to a quincea\u00f1era\u00a0birthday party. An early lesson in how to get in and out of a vehicle in style: One birthday girl, wearing a billowing turquoise dress, climbs aboard her limo. Mind the dress: Other female revellers offer a helping hand, their own party dresses somewhat sober in comparison. Let's hear it for the boys: Complementing this  birthday girl's colour scheme were her male friends, who looked smart in braces and bowties. The brighter, the better: Leticia, dressed in a bright pink evening gown has her own moment in the spotlight, posing in a limo that has zebra-skin seats and even a bar facility. Video courtesy of signaturefilmsphotography.com. Latin American communities in the US take\u00a0quincea\u00f1era just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses. For example, when Disney released the hit film Frozen in 2014, it prompted a surge of Elsa-inspired dresses. At the other end of the spectrum, indigenous tribes in  jungle communities in the likes of Gueatemala would celebrate in a much simpler fashion. It's all a far cry from the more humble traditions of quincea\u00f1era.\u00a0According to folklore, in the months before turning 15, a daughter would be taught skills to prepare her for ensuing marriage including cooking, weaving and even tips about how to bring up her own children. It is thought that quincea\u00f1era has its roots in  ancient Aztec culture. 15 is the number: Quincea\u00f1era is celebrated differently in different countries but is essentially a coming-of-age party. From the Latin American communities of Los Angeles to the streets of Mexico and even in Cuba, when a girl hits the age of 15, a huge party promptly follows. Essentially a coming-of-age affair, quincea\u00f1era - literally meaning '15 years old', has taken off in much the same way that the high school prom has, with celebrations and outfits becoming increasingly extravagant in recent decades. In the past, a girl celebrating her quincea\u00f1era would be preparing for marriage and offered advice from older females on how best to equip herself for womanhood. Skills considered essential for being a good wife, for example sewing, cooking, cleaning and taking care of infants would be learned. At her quincea\u00f1era, the girl is 'presented' to her community and may be expected to make a speech. After an 'acceptance' of the girl, the party-goers would then pray before a meal is served. Although most historians agree", "abstract": "In Monterrey, Mexico, young girls celebrate their quincea\u00f1era, or transition into womanhood, with extravagant parties that include multiple limousines, matching outfits, and lavish decorations. Parents and relatives often spend large sums of money to ensure the celebration is memorable, with some parties resembling garish wedding receptions. The tradition has its roots in ancient Aztec culture, and while celebrations vary across Latin American countries, the trend of increasingly extravagant quincea\u00f1eras is similar to the trend of high school proms in the UK and US."}

And Mancini has cheekily hinted that Toure would fancy a move to Italy after a difficult season with City chasing Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race. Yaya Toure (left) is wanted by Roberto Mancini (right) at Inter Milan after their time at Manchester City.

Mancini is back as Inter Milan manager and wants to bring high-profile players to Italy's Serie A. Toure has two years left on his City contract, and there seems no chance that the Premier League champions would be interested in selling a star player and part of the spine of Manuel Pellegrini's team. And Pellegrini has spoken out previously to confirm that Toure will not be leaving - not that it's stopping Mancini. Last month Pellegrini said: 'I don\u2019t have an opinion about what another manager says about Yaya. 'Of course, every manager of every team would want Yaya in their team but I don\u2019t have anything to say about that.' Toure rues a missed chance for City - and he has struggled to match their usual standards at times this year. Manuel Pellegrini says Mancini can forget about signing Toure but the Italian won't seem to back down. And Mancini certainly seems interested in his former players, having also tried to sign City youth product from Fiorentina, where he is on loan, in January. 'We did try to get him, as he was my player at City,' Mancini told Gazzetta TV. 'Fiorentina seemed open to it, but the move didn\u2019t go through.'

Williams at the Empire State Building on Friday.\u00a0He warned the entertainment industry could be 'frozen in litigation' after a jury determined he and Robin Thicke had copied Marvin Gaye's 'Got To Give It Up' Pharrell told the Financial Times: 'If we lose our freedom to be inspired we're going to look up one day and the entertainment industry as we know it will be frozen in litigation. 'This is about protecting the intellectual rights of people who have ideas. 'This applies to fashion, music, design... anything.' He added: 'The verdict handicaps any creator out there who is making something that might be inspired by something else. Explaining that 'everything that's around you in a room' was inspired by something or someone else, he said: 'If you kill that, there's no creativity.' He said he and Thicke were considering their 'next steps', but declining to comment on whether or not they would appeal against the verdict. Robin Thicke (left) and Pharrell Williams (right) were ordered to pay $7.4million after a jury ruled that their hit Blurred Lines\u00a0copied elements of Marvin Gaye's (pictured center) 1977 song Got To Give It Up. Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013 and it sold more than seven million tracks in the United States. Pictured, the wildly popular music video starring model\u00a0Emily Ratajkowski. Marvin Gaye's family filed an injunction in court on Tuesday that could end the sale and distribution of 'Blurred Lines' - the wildly successful song that they claim was ripped off of Gaye's 1977 hit. The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would\u00a0prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single, which sold millions worldwide and also featured T.I. Pharrell and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song. Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I. - whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr - as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment. The injunction against Blurred Lines could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits. The family said in a statement released Wednesday: 'With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist. Pharrell (pictured performing with Thicke and T.I.) said the judgement would stifle creativity in the industry. Marvin Gaye's (pictured) family have filed an injunction that could end the sale and distribution of Blurred Lines. 'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.' The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Pharrell had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap\u00a0reported. The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage. 'This did not happen.\u00a0We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. 'This also did not happen.' Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013.

British holidaymakers look set for cheaper European holidays after the pound hit its highest level against the euro for more than seven years. Sterling rose above 1.40 euros yesterday to a level not seen since December 2007 \u2013 giving British families more \u2018bang for their buck\u2019 on the Continent. The latest surge was seen as a vote of confidence in the British economy at a time when the euro is tumbling on global currency markets. The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing. A British family now changing \u00a3500 would get 70 euros more than they would have done just six months ago and more than 120 euros more than two years ago.

Some experts believe sterling could rise to 1.55 euros in the coming months as the British economy leaves the struggling eurozone in its wake. David Swann, head of pricing at currency exchange experts Travelex, said: \u2018The pound is clearly on a winning streak at the moment, having struck another fresh high against the euro. With the pound up 16 per cent against the euro compared to last year, it\u2019s going to make a big difference to the Brits who are now booking their Easter and summer holidays.\u2019 The euro has been in decline for months but the sell-off accelerated this week after the European Central Bank started printing money through quantitative easing in a bid to kick-start growth across the region. The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing. The situation in Greece \u2013 where the new Left-wing government is struggling to win support from its European paymasters over fresh emergency funding \u2013 has also driven the euro lower. Although a strong pound is a boon for British holidaymakers, it can hinder UK exporters by making the goods they sell overseas more expensive for foreign buyers. Harry Adams, managing director of currency specialist Argentex, said the pound could hit 1.55 euros before the end of the year \u2013 a level not seen since mid-2002. \u2018The euro bashing continues and I would be wary to predict when this will end,\u2019 he said. \u2018Investors are very wary of holding euros with the recent implementation of quantitative easing and the uncertainty over Greece.

We offer our heartfelt condolences for the pain you must be feeling at this time after the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the horrendous crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. There are no words of comfort that we could express that would ever be adequate. We know something about this sorrow. Almost 19 years ago our community lost 16 high school French Club students, along with five chaperones, in the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, New York. It is impossible to be prepared for such a horrific tragedy that touches so many so personally. During the dark hours of waiting for word of possible survivors from Flight 800, the pain for the family members was excruciating. As word came that there were no survivors, that all hope was extinguished, the anguish became almost unbearable. Students, former students, teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they didn't know where else to go to find consolation. Local pastors, priests, teachers and counselors were also gathering at the school to offer whatever comfort could be offered in such a moment. Within hours, phone calls began pouring in from former students and teachers who were now living outside the area, offering condolences and prayers for all. Since the disaster occurred over water, the recovery of loved ones took days, and even weeks in some cases.  Positive identification of each individual lost took even longer, which only added to the anguish. The identifications came in one at a time over a period of several days; the waiting was nearly impossible to bear. School was not in session during the summer months, so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time. A community prayer service was arranged and held in the high school gymnasium to provide a place to weep together, and to share each other's pain. Local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members, and this continued for several months. Some struggled so deeply that professional counseling was suggested. Because we are a community of about 5,000 with just one high school, almost everyone opened their arms of support to those in deepest need by providing meals, baby-sitting, housecleaning and laundry services. Funeral services were held one at a time, some in the high school and others in local churches. Long lines of mourners waited in silence for the opportunity to at least offer condolences to family members. Twenty-one funeral services over a period of several days left many in the community without any more tears to cry. Within a couple of months, a memorial service was held on the local athletic field and attended by thousands. The hope was to bring closure for the community so it could attempt to return to a somewhat normal daily routine. This helped for some, but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them.  When a parent, or someone serving as a parent, loses a child, an empty spot occurs in the heart that never heals. They may find comfort in the thought that their child is in the arms of a loving God, but that assurance does not mend the broken heart. Over time, the various families that lost their children in the tragedy formed support groups to share their loss. Many of the folks have reached out to others going through a similar type of loss to offer their comfort, and have found a little bit of personal healing in the process. In the years since the crash, many of the pastors and priests who served the families have moved away or retired from pastoral service. Those of us who counseled from the beginning have at times needed the support of one another to restore our strength and spirits to then be able to serve our own parishioners. This is the beginning of a very long journey for all those willing to serve those in such great pain at this time. At this writing I am shedding tears just recalling the events that started almost 19 years ago. If any of our experiences can assist your community of Haltern am See in getting through this horrible event, then know that it is in pain we achieve our greatest victories.", "abstract": "The community of Montoursville, Pennsylvania, offers condolences to the community of Haltern am See, Germany, for the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash.

{"article": "John Bilardi is a shattered man. He has poured his heart out in an interview about his late son, the troubled youth dubbed \"Jihad Jake\", who died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week. Mr Bilardi tells 60 Minutes that he cannot come to grips with his son's decisions, to run away from their Melbourne home and join Islamic State, a move which ultimately cost him his life, at age 18. 'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' he tells reporter Michael Usher. The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer. 'Just out of the blue he said, \"I've gone Muslim\",' his father said. 'I can't imagine how he was feeling.' He recounts his son's final message, sent from the ISIS bunker to his father, as he was convinced to take his own life. It was: 'Hi Dad, I am very happy to be here'. Scroll down for videos. 'He was just a shy, lonely young man,' John Bilardi says of his son Jake who joined Islamic State. The photograph of Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi which was first released to show his allegiance to Islamic State. John Bilardi breaks down as he recalls 'a lonely young man' and what drove his teenage son into the arms of terrorists in the Middle East. And Mr Bilardi issued a chilling warning to other parents about the lure of terrorists to defenceless young Australians. 'It's going on, it's real.' His revelations coming, as an Islamic State propaganda website, geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the Melbourne teenage jihadi, did anything but glorify the actions of the 18-year-old suicide bomber. The post, titled as the story of Abu Abdullah Al-Austr\u0101l\u012b \u2013 the name Bilardi adopted after he travelled to Iraq to join IS \u2013 gives the teenager some praise as a devout Muslims who prays and fasts often. But the rant describes Bilardi as having \u2018a weak body\u2019 and having'sold his soul for a cheap price', revealing how misguided his decisions were. Bilardi, who fled to the Middle East last year from his Melbourne home, reportedly died after he blew himself up in a suicide mission targeting the Iraqi armed forces at Ramadi in central Iraq last week. Suicide bomber: ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it. John Bilardi talks with Michael Usher on 60 Minutes on Sunday Night, revealing the possible reasons around his son's fateful decision to flee into the arms of Islamic State. The attack was a failure. Iraqi military official, General Tahssin Ibrahim, said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in Bilardi's suicide mission. The extremist site sought to praise Bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice. \u2018He started fighting in Baij\u012b against the ISF R\u0101fidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain,\u2019 the post, on a tumblr blog site associated with the Islamic extremist group, said. It goes on to say that Bilardi volunteered for a'martyrdom operation' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission. Earlier social media posts suggested Bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in Baiji in Iraq, but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet. Instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to Ramadi in Iraq. The post said Bilardi was 'full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his Lord and receive the great rewards promised by Him.' But it goes on to mock his sacrifice. 'This brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to Allah for a cheap price,' the post says. Jake Bilardi (pictured, left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam according to school friends, and another image of him wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (pictured right) An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter, ahead of his suicide mission in Iraq, which authorities labelled 'a failure' The post said that during his time in Ramadi, Bilardi was very devout 'known for his worship of Allah' and would fast every other day.

{"article": "The mother of an unarmed teenager shot dead by police in Madison, Wisconsin, says that similar killings throughout the country have become 'an epidemic'. Andrea Irwin said that the two weeks since her son Tony Robinson was killed have been 'every mother's worst nightmare' The biracial 19-year-old was shot dead by white Madison police officer Matt Kenny, a 12-year- veteran, after an altercation around 6.30pm on March 6. Scroll down for video. Andrea Irwin, the mother of Tony Robinson, said that teenager such as her son being shot by police had become an 'epidemic' Robinson, 19, was fatally shot by Madison, Wisconsin police officer Matt Kenny earlier this month following an incident where he was jumping into traffic. 'What was his reason for taking my son's life' Ms Irwin said when asked what she would say to Kenny by CBS News. 'What exactly was it that made him feel like that was his only option, that there was no other option? And for it to be death, and to impose that sentence on my son.' 'I feel like I'm in a dream and I just want to wake up,' she said. Robinson, who had been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, had reportedly taken hallucinogenic mushrooms before he was shot. A friend called 911 for help from police in dealing with him after he began going in and out of traffic and allegedly assaulted someone. Ms Irwin, who did not confirm that her son had taken hallucinogens, said that officers should have been conscious about approaching someone on mind-altering substances and that more than one officer should have been used in the incident. The mother, who said she 'grew up with him' after having the boy young, was told about the shooting by his friend's mother, according to the Guardian. She arrived at the University of Wisconsin medical center but was kept alone after not being allowed to wait with her boyfriend for news of her son's condition. Ms Irwin (right, comforting her 15-year-old son Jordan) said that recent police shootings have been a'slaughtering of children'. Robinson's uncle Turin Carter said that the young man, with a white mother and black father, was the 'face of America'. Above, Carter and others carry Robinson's casket. He was shot in the head, torso and arm. Ms Irwin, who has three remaining children, eventually learned that her friend had been shot by a police officer from a relative that saw it on the news. She called the experience 'gut-wrenching'. A string of unarmed black men killed by police last summer set off a series of protests after the deaths. Subsequent decisions by grand juries in St Louis and New York not indict the officers involved intensified demonstrations that coalesced under the slogan 'black lives matter'. Ms Irwin said it has been a'slaughtering of children. And no answers behind it, no retribution'. 'They're not even allowing them to live their lives or start their lives'. Robinson's uncle said that Robinson, who had a white mother and black father, was 'the face of America.' 'I think that our family dynamic shows that this is a universal issue, because we are not a family of just one race. We are a family of many races,' Turin Carter said. Police killings of unarmed black civilians have led to waves of protests against perceived brutality and bias. Above, demonstrations in Madison over the past two weeks have remained peaceful. Wisconsin law now mandates that officer-involved deaths be investigated by agencies outside the police force. The family of Officer Kenny (pictured) released a statement supporting him. Protests in Madison, a college town and state capital where blacks make up 7 per cent of the cities 240,000 people, have been peaceful. The Wisconsin Justice Department\u2019s Division of Criminal Investigation is looking into the incident. A new Wisconsin law mandates that outside agencies must investigate\u00a0officer-involved shootings. Ms Irwin says she has spoken to Madison Police Chief Mike Koval about the incident and investigation into it. The family of Officer Kenny, 45, released a statement on Thursday saying they were deeply saddened by the 'tragedy'. 'Madison, as a community, can do better for all its citizens. We must discuss, perhaps with more urgency, how our community handles racial inequality and then do something about it,' Amanda Kenny said, according to NBC. However,she added \u00a0'while we acknowledge that Madison has problems, we also feel that my brother is not one of them.'

{"article": "For Danny Cipriani and Billy Twelvetrees, this must have felt like a monumental comedown, eight days after they had participated in one of the great occasions at Twickenham. At least Cipriani had a win to savour, although the Sale fly-half finished Sunday's game in the sin-bin. For Gloucester captain Twelvetrees, it was a miserable result on a miserable day in Salford. Danny Cipriani kicked five out of five to help Sale Sharks to a comfortable victory over Gloucester. Both men had come off the bench as England thrashed France in the Six Nations finale only to miss out on the title again, but there was no residual goodwill as they clashed three minutes from time at the AJ Bell Stadium, before Cipriani was yellow-carded for a deliberate knock-on. Compared to a last day of the championship that was awash with audacious artistry, this was an alien form of rugby. It was wet and windy and chilly and Sale were more pragmatic and clinical in the difficult conditions. Gloucester had been in Tenerife for a week of warm-weather training, which wasn't ideal preparation for an arm-wrestle contest in the North West. After enjoying the sun, David Humphreys' side caught a cold and yet another defeat in this fixture has left Gloucester stuck in ninth place in the Aviva Premiership table. They continue to punch below their weight. The first half was grim fare. James Hook struck two penalties for the visitors but Sale snatched a try in the 22nd minute when Samoa centre Johnny Leota managed to ground the ball against the base of a post after Andrei Ostrikov had been held up short. Cipriani converted that and added three penalties either side of the break to put his team in control. As impressive as his kicking was Cipriani (centre) was all over the pitch and proved defensively solid. Just before the hour, the hosts claimed a second try and it was a gem. From a rolling maul on the right, the impressive Chris Cusiter broke infield and released Tom Arscott. The wing burst into the 22 and was tackled but from the ruck Cipriani's clever delayed pass sent lock Josh Beaumont over the line from close range. Cipriani added the conversion and Sale stood firm, despite Nathan Hines and Cipriani going to the bin, to ensure Mark Cueto celebrated his 300th game for the club with a win. Gloucester had plenty of attacking possession but not enough nous and precision. Brendan Macken failed to release Charlie Sharples for a clear run to the line and moments later, when the wing received a pass in space from Jonny May, he was scythed down well by Leota. Josh Beaumont crosses the line to score the final try for Sale and put them game beyond Gloucester. Sale's director of rugby Steve Diamond was satisfied but does not believe that his side \u2014 currently seventh \u2014 are equipped to push for a play-off place despite a favourable run-in. 'We're a good side here,' he said. 'The one area that we didn't have dominance was the scrum. In every other area we were in control of it. I'm really pleased. 'Our first goal is to qualify for the Champions Cup and to do that we have to finish sixth. I think we're probably a bit away from the top four. We can't compete with the super teams. On our day we can beat anyone here but we've got two difficult games away from home.' Humphreys defended Gloucester's preparations, saying: 'We had a very positive training week but we couldn't translate that into a performance today. We've been back for 48 hours to acclimatise again and we had a good training session yesterday in similar weather conditions to this.'

A second-wicket partnership of 160 between Ahmed Shehzad (93) and Haris Sohail (70) and a quick-fire 65 from captain Misbah-ul-Haq helped Pakistan amass 339 for six in their 50 overs, and although the UAE lost only eight wickets in their reply, they made just 210, leaving them well short of their target. Victory at McLean Park moved Pakistan up to fourth in Pool B at the expense of Ireland, with the two sides going head to head in Adelaide on March 15. Pakistan's Ahmed Shehzad hits out during his innings of 93 in their World Cup victory over the UAE. Shehzad anchored the Pakistan innings with 93 as his team posted a total of 339 for six in Napier. Haris Sohail also made 70 runs as Pakistan set a large total in Napier, ultimately winning by 129 runs. Pakistan captain Misbah Ul Haq chipped in with a quickfire 65 as the runs racked up. Pakistan's total would have been challenging for an established nation, let alone an associate, although they did not get off to the best of starts. The match was only 3.3 overs old when Nasir Jamshed went looking to pull and succeeded only in skying Manjula Guruge's short delivery to mid-on to depart for four. Sohail joined Shehzad at the crease and it was not long before the scoreboard began to tick over, with the Pakistan total passing 100 in the 23rd over. Shehzad, dropped in the seventh and eighth overs, lifted Amjad Javed over the ropes for the first six of the match at the end of the 16th over and was raising his bat to celebrate fifty - his 11th in ODIs - in the 24th over. Sohail joined his batting partner in passing the half-century mark in the very next over off Mohammad Tauqir - which also pushed their partnership past the 100-run mark. Pakistan celebrate at the end of their 129-run victory in Napier, which boosts their quarter-final chances. Pakistan moved up to fourth in Pool B ahead of Ireland, whom they play in Adelaide on March 15. Misbah-ul-Haq pulls the ball away for four during Pakistan's innings as the UAE were batted out of the match. Sohail clubbed Krishna Chandran to the mid-wicket boundary as the partnership passed 150 at the start of the 32nd over but his time at the crease came to an end in the next over as he mis-hit Mohammad Naveed to mid-on to depart for 70 from 83 balls. Shehzad was run out for 93, from 105 balls, shorty afterwards but with captain Misbah joining Sohaib Maqsood in the middle, Pakistan were well set on 176 for three with 15.5 overs to play. Misbah and Maqsood put on 75 runs in 8.5 overs for the fourth wicket, but their quick-fire partnership ended in the 43rd over with Pakistan on 251 as Maqsood, having made 45 from 31 deliveries, clubbed to backward point where Rohan Mustafa juggled repeatedly before taking the catch. Misbah continued to score freely after Maqsood's departure and brought up his 41st ODI fifty at the end of the 46th over before he and Umar Akmal (19) fell to Guruge in the penultimate over. UAE opener Andri Berenger walks off after being dismissed by Sohail Khan for two runs. Sohail Khan celebrates after taking one of his two wickets as the UAE were reduced to 210 for eight. Pakistan's Rahat Ali (left) celebrates with his team-mates after removing Amjad Ali for 14 runs. Shahid Afridi clubbed 21 runs from seven balls in the closing stages to pass 8,000 runs in ODI cricket as Pakistan set UAE an unlikely target of 340 to win the match. Rahat Ali drew first blood for Pakistan in the seventh over of UAE's innings when Amjad Ali (14) chopped on to his own stumps to leave the associate nation on 19 for one. The score had not changed when Sohail Khan tricked Andri Berenger into edging behind five balls later to leave UAE two down and facing an uphill battle. Their challenge became even more difficult when Krishna Chandran offered a leading edge to give Khan his second wicket and leave UAE struggling on 25 for three after 10 overs. Shehzad's innings came to an end when he was run out by Shaiman Anwar. The UAE players celebrate after taking the wicket of Pakistan batsman Sohaib Maqsood. But Khurram Khan and Shaiman Anwar posted 83 to steady the ship, before the former was caught at backward square leg off Maqsood, going for 43.

{"article": "Suzette Davenport said tougher sanctions are needed for those caught making calls, sending texts and checking emails while driving. DRIVERS who use mobile phones at the wheel should be banned from the roads, Britain\u2019s top traffic officer said yesterday. Suzette Davenport insisted that a rise in offending showed much tougher punishments were needed to deter the worst culprits. But she claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in May\u2019s election to act against the estimated 500,000 motorists who break the law every day. The Gloucestershire chief constable said the absence of proper penalties risked making it socially acceptable to text or surf the internet while driving. The offence of using a hand-held mobile at the wheel currently attracts only a \u00a3100 fine with three penalty points. Miss Davenport said: \u2018If someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications. \u2018If we don\u2019t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this. 'I have had those conversations with ministers. I would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement. The minister doesn\u2019t like my proposal.\u2019 Asked why ministers had rejected her call, she told the BBC: \u2018Probably timing\u2019s not great. I don\u2019t think it would be popular with lots of people. 'An election is not too far away so I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not likely to pick up and run with anything that they feel is not likely to be helpful to them in the next election.\u2019 Miss Davenport, who speaks on road issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said drivers repeatedly glancing at their smartphones were effectively using a computer. Her intervention follows the release of figures last week showing that mobile offending has risen despite numerous crackdowns. Robert Goodwill, Tory transport minister, rejected the claim that he was blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year \u2013 up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009. He insisted the Government was reviewing the introduction of a six-point penalty, two instances of which would trigger a ban. And he turned his fire on the police, saying chief constables were too quick to take the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers. \u2018One of the reasons people do these things is because they think they can get away with it,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is important that police and crime commissioners and chief constables look at the resources they put into this as opposed to other more easy offences to detect like speeding where cameras can catch people on an industrial scale. \u2018There is no point increasing the penalties if we are not actually catching people.\u2019 Research shows that the distraction effect of using a mobile phone is worse than being over the limit on drink or drugs. But the penalties are far lower \u2013 unless motorists are convicted of careless or dangerous driving. And official figures show that the number of fixed penalty notices has fallen 26 per cent while offending \u2013 as observed in spot checks by transport officials \u2013 has risen 14 per cent since 2009. Edmund King of the AA said: \u2018Basically we need more cops in cars to target the mobile phone abusers that we observe behind the wheel on most journeys. \u2018Most drivers would welcome harsher penalties but we still need the perceived risk of being caught to increase before more drivers hang up behind the wheel.\u2019 The row threatens to overshadow the introduction today of \u2018drug driving\u2019 laws. Drivers face prosecution if they are caught exceeding new limits which have, for the first time, been laid down for eight illegal drugs and eight prescription drugs. The levels for the illegal drugs, which include heroin, cocaine and cannabis, virtually mean there will be zero tolerance for drivers caught with these substances in their system. Police will be able to use \u2018drugalysers\u2019 to screen for cannabis and cocaine at the roadside. Officers will also be able to test for these and other drugs including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin at a police station, even if a driver passes the roadside check. Under the existing law it is illegal to use a phone while driving, even when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic. If caught, a driver faces an automatic fixed penalty notice worth \u00a3100 and 3 penalty points on their licence. Only if it goes to court do they risk being disqualified, but the maximum fine is only \u00a31,000. By comparison, drink-drivers face 6 months in jail, a fine of up to \u00a35,000 fine and a driving ban for at least a year, rising to three years if convicted twice in a decade. The research revealed that using a handheld device is more distracting than alcohol or drugs, with drivers twice as likely to have their head down and eyes off the road while texting or using the internet.

{"article": "Rima Karak has won wide-spread support after defending herself against Islamist\u00a0Hani Al-Seba'i. A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview. The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions.

Ova the top: Washington Fox 5's Bob Barnard got an earful from an African Moon Moth in a live spot at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History on Monday when the bug laid two eggs in his ear. Barnard was doing a story on Museum Week in DC when the moth laid eggs in his ear. He had no clue it had happened until after the broadcast. The moth had previously caused Barnard a bit of a tickle, which he at first appeared to believe was a bite. However, the insect zookeeper Barnard was interviewing informed him that African Moon Moths don't have mouths at all and are thus incapable of biting. Their plump, green larvae, the zookeeper explained, do all the eating. The moths then live off the fat stores once they become adults. 'That African Moon Moth on my ear on live TV laid two eggs! (Yuck),' Barnard tweeted Monday. Big and beautiful: The African Moon moth measures around 4 inches across with tail-like structures dangling majestically from its wings. The moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on Barnard. Perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs. Either way, the moth won't be around long enough to see if Barnard helps raise her young. The Moon Moth, unable to eat, lives only a handful of days. She does, however lay hundreds of eggs--just a few at a time--before she dies.", "abstract": "During a live broadcast from the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, a palm-sized African Moon Moth landed on Fox 5 news anchor Bob Barnard's head and laid two eggs in his ear.

{"article": "Authorities have today arrested 23 suspected members of a terror cell in connection with a jihadist massacre at Tunisia's national museum which left 21 people dead. The attack last week targeted the Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis with 20 foreign tourists, including 17 people from a cruise ship gunned down. Tunisia's interior ministry confirmed the arrests saying that 80 per cent of the terror cell responsible for the attack had been broken up and that the suspects are due to appear in court. A man lays flowers on the bloodstained entrance to the Bardo Museum in Tunisia. Today 23 suspects have been arrested in connection with the jihadist attack. However, they added that three suspects involved in the attack, who are thought to be Moroccan and Algerian nationals, are still on the run. Interior minister Najem Gharsalli said: 'Twenty-three suspects including a woman have been arrested as part of a terrorist cell involved in the attack.' Among those arrested was head of the terror cell, who was identified as Mohammed Emine Guebli. Mr Gharsalli added how the gunmen attacked the museum wearing belts filled with powerful explosive semtex, which would have been 'catastrophic' if used. He also detailed that two members of the group arrested had also fought with extremists in Syria, with the three others, including the attackers, training in Libya. CCTV released earlier this week showed the two gunmen and a third unidentified man roaming around inside the museum before the attack. Today it was revealed how the gunmen attacked the museum wearing belts filled with powerful explosive semtex. Tunisian national Maher Ben Mouldi Kaidi had been previously identified as a suspect and is alleged to have provided the automatic weapons to the gunmen. The minister also said the operation was organised by an Algerian jihadist named Lokmane Abou Sakhr, one of the leaders of the Al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, the main Tunisian armed group active along the border with Algeria. Earlier this week a video emerged of the moment two gunman began roaming the Bardo Museum looking for victims. The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other wears a red hooded jumper and tracksuit pants. Tourists and visitors flee from the Bardo Museum following the attack. Twenty foreign tourists, including 17 from a cruise ship were gunned down and killed. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum. Eight of the foreign tourists were killed as they got off a bus in front of the musuem building while another 12 were killed inside along with a Tunisian policeman. The attack was the worst on foreigners in Tunisia since an Al-Qaeda suicide bombing of a synagogue killed 21 people on the island of Djerba in 2002. Authorities are now organising an international march 'against terrorism' in Tunis on Sunday, similar to the one in Paris that followed the attacks earlier this year on the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly and a kosher supermarket. French President Francois Hollande is among those who have announced they will attend.

However, there appears to be no clear CCTV footage to identify the underwear-loving criminal. In the latest heist, which took place on Saturday morning, a dozen bras were apparently taken from a rear display unit valued at $500.

The video is titled 'From Who Excused [sic] To Those Not Excused' - suggesting that disability is no excuse for not serving for ISIS. In the five minute clip the two men, who are deaf-mutes and brothers, are shown working as traffic police in Iraq's second city Mosul, which has been under ISIS control since last summer. Scroll down for video. Two deaf-mute brothers who claim to be fighting for ISIS in Iraq have taken part in the group's latest propaganda video, in an attempt to recruit more people with disabilities to fight for the terror group. The footage, which features the Islamic State flag in the top right hand corner, also shows them working for the traffic police in Mosul, in an attempt to depict an normal life as part of the terror group's Caliphate. Speaking in sign language with English and Arabic subtitles, one of the men says: 'I am a deaf mute who works in the traffic police in the Islamic State with my brother Abu Abdur-Rahman. 'As for my message to the apostate peshmerga (Kurdish fighters) we will strike you soon, by Allah's permission. I am living in a land in which Allah's sharia is established.' Wearing black jumpsuits, ammunition pouches and carrying what appear to be M16 assault rifles, the pair also speak about their desire to'slaughter' their enemies including Britain, America, France and Italy, saying 'you will not stop our advance'. The fighters also threaten Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and those who have allied with the West, vowing to destroy them. In the final section of the slickly produced and professionally edited film, the brothers are shown assembling simple rocket launchers which they claim are used to fire at Kurdish fighters. The weapons consist of little more than crudely made explosives balanced on a metal frame which is tilted upwards and held in place using a few rocks. In the last seconds of the film, which features the Islamic State's logo in the top right hand corner, one of the men presses a trigger, launching the rockets. The last seconds of the film show the pair wiring up and launching two crude missiles which they claim are being aimed at Kurdish peshmerga fighters. Alex Kassirer, a researcher at Flashpoint Intelligence, who spoke to NBC News, said the video'represents an attempt by the group to recruit other physically or otherwise impaired individuals, as well as demonstrates the multifaceted responsibilities of those in its ranks.' ISIS's ability to recruit western jihadis using online propaganda films and its monthly magazine, Dabiq, is well documented, and the films often feature fighters speaking about their daily lives, in an attempt to present life under the extremist Caliphate in a positive light.

{"article": "Keith Thurman and Robert Guerrero gave a prime-time television audience something to watch Saturday night. Thurman won a piece of the welterweight title with a bruising decision win over Guerrero in the debut of a new boxing series on network television. And he did it with the kind of fight that had the crowd on its feet and gave a much needed boost to boxing in the first prime-time fights on NBC in 30 years. 'That's kind of performance that wins the hearts of fans even when you don't win the fight,' Guerrero said. 'The fans love that and that's what boxing is all about.' Keith Thurman (left) lands a left jab on Robert Guerrero during their WBA welterweight title bout. The fight was the highlight of a card that also included a win by Adrien Broner over John Molina in a super lightweight bout. But while fans booed that fight for lack of action, they cheered from the opening bell as Thurman took apart Guerrero in a fight that had a little bit of something for every fan - except a knockout. 'I know I was hurting him each and every round,' Thurman said. 'But he's a veteran and knew how to pace himself and stay a little out of my range.' Thurman knocked Guerrero down in the ninth round and won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown. But Guerrero fought hard and wasn't afraid to trade punches even while bleeding from a cut over his left eye late in the bout. A bloodied\u00a0Guerrero rises to his feet after he was knocked down by Thurman in the ninth round. Thurman is sent to the neutral corner by\u00a0referee Kenny Bayless as\u00a0Guerrero recovers on the canvas. Thurman landed 211 of 598 punches to 104 of 497 for Guerrero, but that didn't tell the whole story. Thurman's punches were much harder and seemed to shake Guerrero on several occasions, though they didn't deter him from pressing the fight even after being knocked down and nearly knocked out in the ninth round. 'I keep fighting my heart out and that's what the fans like about me,' Guerrero said. Thurman won every round on one ringside scorecard and 10 rounds on the other two, using thudding punches to keep Guerrero away. Still, he was never able to put him away and Guerrero came back in the 10th round to land some big punches of his own while Thurman was on the ropes. 'Robert Guerrero was a tremendous warrior,' Thurman said. 'He was there the whole way.' Thurman\u00a0won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown. It was a signature win for Thurman, and not only because he was showcased on the top of the television card. He beat a fighter who fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2012, lasting all 12 rounds though dropping a lopsided decision. And he remained unbeaten in 25 fights with a performance that could put him in a big pay-per-view fight his next time out. The fight was the first of 20 cards scheduled this year for the Premier Boxing Champions series put together by manager Al Haymon and featuring his fighters. It was also the first of five scheduled Saturday prime-time bouts on NBC. And while it was created for television with an all-star cast of announcers that included Al Michaels, Marv Albert and Laila Ali, it also gave the crowd of 10,106 at the MGM Grand something different, too. Adrien Broner (right) hits\u00a0John Molina with a right jab during their\u00a0super lightweight bout in Las Vegas. Boxers were introduced on a stage at one end of the arena, and there were new high definition monitors above the ring to show the action. Unlike most boxing events, the fights also went off on time to accommodate television. In the first fight, Broner boxed his way to an easy win over Molina, using his left jab to pile up points. Despite winning every round on two of the three scorecards, though, Broner was booed by many in the crowd at the MGM Grand for not trying for a knockout in the super lightweight bout. Broner, trying to re-establish himself after a loss in 2012 to Marcos Maidana, used his superior speed to keep Molina off balance, rarely allowing him to land more than a single punch at a time. The former three-time champion was so far ahead in the final round that he did little but dance away from Molina, finally raising his hands in triumph with 10 seconds still left in the fight. Broner celebrates his victory after finishing his fight with a scorecard of\u00a0120-108, 120-108 and 118-110. 'I know I lived up to the hype,' Broner said. 'He was swinging for the fences and I stayed dangerous. I felt like I beat all odds tonight.'

{"article": "The word 'lunatic' itself was derived from the Latin word for moon 'luna,' as many were convinced that the celestial body could cause disease and strange behaviour. And it's a theory that persists today, with many people believing that a full moon is more likely to coincide with hectic periods in hospitals or in birth wards. But Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of California, has carried out a study that proves that\u00a0the concept is essentially rubbish. A researcher from the University of California says that claims the moon causes illnesses are rubbish.\u00a0Dr Margot said that when life is hectic on the day of a full moon, many people remember the association because it confirms their belief - but they do not remember when nothing in particular happens on such a day. His\u00a0research\u00a0was carried out to\u00a0illustrate how intelligent and otherwise reasonable people develop strong beliefs that are not aligned with reality. 'The absence of a lunar influence on human affairs has been demonstrated in the areas of automobile accidents, hospital admissions, surgery outcomes, cancer survival rates, menstruation, births, birth complications, depression, violent behaviour, and even criminal activity', Dr Margot writes. Even though a 40-year-old UCLA study demonstrated that the timing of births does not correlate in any way with the lunar cycle, the belief in a lunar effect has persisted. A full moon is when it is on the opposite side of  Earth from the sun. This means its entire surface is lit up by the sun, making it especially bright. A new moon is when it is in the same direction as the sun, so its 'far side' is lit, and it can barely be seen in Earth's sky. On average, the moon is 239,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth and takes 27 days, seven hours, 43 minutes and 11.6 seconds to complete one orbit. A 2004 study in a nursing journal, for example, suggested that the full moon influenced the number of hospital admissions in a medical unit in Barcelona, Spain. But Dr Margot identified multiple flaws in the data collection and analysis of the 2004 research. By re-analysing the data, he showed that the number of admissions was unrelated to the lunar cycle. 'The moon is innocent,' Dr Margot said. Dr Margot cited what scientists refer to as the 'confirmation bias' - people's tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms their beliefs and ignore data that contradict them. When life is hectic on the day of a full moon, many people remember the association because it confirms their belief. But hectic days that do not correspond with a full moon are promptly ignored and forgotten because they do not reinforce the belief. The moon is even blamed when things get crazy at hospital emergency rooms (stock image shown) or birth wards. 'Some nurses ascribe the apparent chaos to the moon, but dozens of studies show that the belief is unfounded,' said Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a UCLA professor of planetary astronomy. Dr Margot said the societal costs of flawed beliefs can be enormous. In just one current example, the recent measles outbreak appears to have been triggered by parents' questionable beliefs about the safety of the measles vaccine. 'Vaccines are widely and correctly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements, yet vaccine-preventable diseases are killing people because of beliefs that are out of step with scientific facts,' Dr Margot said. A willingness to engage in evidence-based reasoning and admit that one's beliefs may be incorrect will produce a more accurate view of the world and result in better decision-making, he said. 'Perhaps we can start by correcting our delusions about the moon, and work from there,' Dr Margot added. The study was published online by the journal Nursing Research.", "abstract": "A study by Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of California, has shown that the belief that the moon causes illnesses and strange behaviour is unfounded.

That's not a slight on Austin, who also would have impressed Hodgson. But when the England manager names his squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy on Thursday, in Kane he has a striker who has every hallmark of an international footballer. For Austin, the jury is still out. Kane was, essentially, the difference between the two teams at QPR. It wouldn't have come as surprise to Rangers boss Chris Ramsey, who played an influential role in nurturing the striker in the White Hart Lane academy. Spurs striker Kane celebrates as his goals keep Tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish. Rangers star Austin is denied from adding to his impressive goals tally by a save from Hugo Lloris. QPR striker Austin watches as his shot beats Lloris only to crash off the crossbar. 'He has polished himself, I was fortunate to have worked with him,' said Ramsey. 'Would I pick him for England? Yes, I would - but the way I'm going...' Two goals against QPR took his tally for the season to 26. That's a record you simply cannot ignore. Hodgson certainly won't. The only question for the England manager now is if he utilises the striker in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or ease him in during the friendly against Italy. His first goal against Rangers showed great bravery, risking a hefty blow to the head to glance home Andros Townsend's free kick. His second showed great composure, skipping round Rob Green before finishing into an empty net. He ticks every box. But his goals only tell part of the story. Kane's heat map (right) in the opposition half showed he posed a greater threat than Austin (left) Twice he showed excellent vision to set up marauding right-back Kyle Walker with goal scoring opportunities, executing both passes with unerring accuracy. Had it not been for Green's heroics in Rangers' goal, Kane could easily have had four by the time Craig Pawson blew the final whistle. After yesterday, Hodgson will be chomping at the bit to get his hands on Kane later this month. Kane doubled Tottenham's lead in the second half after rounding the keeper to slot into an empty net. CLICK HERE for all the stats from the game, including Harry Kane's second goal (below) Austin has the good grace for congratulate Tottenham keeper Lloris for his saves. The England boss, perhaps, won't be as eager to draft Austin into his plans. This was by no means a poor display from the Rangers striker, who himself could easily have had four goals himself yesterday. Likewise, his goal line clearance to deny Christian Eriksen spoke volumes for his desire and work rate. But Kane won this battle of the future England strikers. He won it hands down. Austin's time may come. But the time, for Kane, has arrived. Kane heads back to the centre circle after handing Spurs the lead in Saturday's only Premier League clash.

In the piece, entitled Heartfelt Story, Mr Wilson, a lay minister, accused her of conducting an affair behind his back and then abandoning him to set up home with her ex-policeman lover. He begins by telling parishioners: \u2018Sadly, I have to report to you, my wife of 20 years recently ended our marriage and not in an amicable or hearty way. I am and have been in quite a mess. \u2018She was constantly out till all hours most nights, coming home with flowers, even a teddy bear that went to bed with her and sat on my bed 24/7. This soft pushover ain\u2019t being pushed over anymore.\u2019 The former media sales consultant wrote under the headline 'Heartless Story': 'She would go missing for days at a time. It was blatantly obvious she was having an affair\u2026 and she came home from him and got in my bed. 'How cold is that dear reader? It's heartless, cruel and just not on. Talk about rubbing it in my face.' Mr Wilson, who is a lay minister at St Bartholomew\u2019s, a C of E church near Bolton, wrote in the Westhoughton Parish Magazine: \u2018I am bereft, numb, angry and disgusted with my estranged wife, a woman I have loved, worshipped and adored for 20 years. Mr Wilson published the rant in the Westhoughton Parish Magazine, which has now been retracted by the church for being 'totally inappropriate' \u2018I understand relationships end \u2026 but to make the decision on your own, then go and jump into the first bed that comes along is wrong.\u2019 \u2018Why I am sharing all this with you? Simply to make you think about your actions that only you choose to do. \u2018I can tell you that during my six years as warden to my own knowledge some 11 relationships have ended in adultery from our own church pews. We are supposed to be a beacon of light for Jesus. We are supposed to live life correctly.\u2019 Church leaders immediately recalled all copies of the magazine, prevented any further deliveries and ordered remaining copies to be pulped. Some parishioners in Westhoughton called for the Bishop of Manchester to intervene. One, who would not be named, said: \u2018He\u2019s obviously in emotional turmoil. We do feel for him but it was totally inappropriate. The parish magazine has never been so controversial.\u2019 Mr Wilson, who joined the church in 1995, became a church warden in 2008 and runs the church youth club. In 2010 he was made a lay minister and has been editor of the parish magazine for several years. He has been married to Alyson for 20 years and the couple have a son Tom, 18, while Mr Wilson has a daughter, Emily, 28, from a previous relationship. In the article he says: \u2018I put a tract on her actions on my Facebook page so all my family and friends found out together. She went mad. She doesn\u2019t like being in the news. So when she gets passed this magazine, I\u2019m sure I will get berated from her. Mr Wilson said his wife Alyson, 56, would sneak out to meet her lover before returning to the marital bed. He said he wrote the five-page rant to parish worshippers because he wanted to 'highlight the impact adultery' \u2018But she lost the right to tell me what to do as soon as she jumped into bed with another. She was so wicked to me that I am lost for words. Sadly, dear readers, she is still trying to blame me. No one ever forces you into the arms of another man.\u2019 Mr Wilson - who has another child, Emily, 26, from a previous relationship - said he now'regrets the turmoil caused' but published the article because he wanted to highlight his wife's alleged cheating. He told MailOnline: 'My intention was to highlight that marriages do break up and cause hurt and that adultery does occur.", "abstract": "A churchwarden in Westhoughton near Bolton has accused his wife of having an affair in a 2,273-word tirade, which he published in the parish magazine he edits.

An interim investigation report last Sunday contained transcripts of conversations between air traffic controllers in the region and the airline that revealed confusion in the hours after the Boeing 777 dropped off radar with 239 people aboard while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. In one conversation four hours after the plane disappeared, a Kuala Lumpur air traffic controller told a Malaysia Airlines official that he would need to wake up his supervisor when pressed on the exact time of the last contact with the plane. The controller came on duty after the plane vanished. Malaysia's transport minister on Thursday vowed to take stern action against an air traffic control supervisor if it is confirmed that he was asleep on the job when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared a year ago. Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said his department viewed the matter seriously and was conducting an internal probe. 'The work is on rotation.... If he is on a working shift, this is serious. We will definitely take action if there is any misconduct,' he told reporters. Liow said the ministry didn't investigate the matter earlier as they were waiting for Sunday's report by the independent safety investigation team. The ministry's probe will be'very fast,' he added, without saying when it would be completed. An interim investigation report  contained transcripts of conversations between air traffic controllers in the region and the airline that revealed confusion in the hours after the Boeing 777 dropped off radar.

Despite an exhaustive search in the southern Indian Ocean where the plane was believed to have crashed based on analyses of transmissions between the aircraft and a satellite, no trace of wreckage has been found. In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the plane's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. The report Sunday also showed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon for the plane's data recorder had expired more than a year before the jet vanished March 8, 2014, because of a computer data error and went unnoticed by maintenance crews. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the hunt for the plane would continue even if searchers scouring a 60,000-square-kilometer (23,166-square-mile) swath of the seabed off Australia's west coast do not find it by May. Liow said a tripartite meeting involving ministers from Australia, Malaysia and China \u2014 where most of the passengers are from \u2014 would take place in Kuala Lumpur next month to discuss the next step.

The 30-year-old had requested a personal hearing after being charged with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official in or around the tunnel area after the final whistle following Albion's 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa this month. Brunt is banned with immediate effect and will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester City. West Bromwich Albion midfielder has been handed a one match ban and an \u00a38,000 fine by the FA. Brunt  argues with referee Anthony Taylor after he sends off Claudio Yacob during the game at Villa Park. The Northern Ireland international faced the threat of a two-game ban and Albion's director of football administration Richard Garlick believes the punishment reflected the circumstances in which the game finished. Villa fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle and had also run onto the surface while the game was still in play, with the invasions the subject of an FA investigation. Referee Anthony Taylor had also sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish towards the end of the match. Thousands streamed on to the pitch after the match, which helped make Brunt's an 'extraordinary case' 'We had a fair hearing and feel the punishment is an acknowledgement by the Commission that this was an extraordinary case,' said Garlick, after the Independent Regulatory Commission in London on Tuesday. 'It was a difficult end to the game for everyone and emotions were running high. 'I think Chris's disciplinary record, which has seen him issued with one red card in more than 400 appearances at the highest levels, was also rightly noted.'", "abstract": "West Bromwich Albion midfielder Chris Brunt has been suspended for one match and fined \u00a38,000 by the Football Association after accepting a misconduct charge.

{"article": "(CNN)Although much of the United States has been shivering this winter, there's been another worrying sign of warming temperatures farther north.  The cap of sea ice that spreads across the Arctic Ocean in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year, according to NASA. Not only was this year's maximum extent, reached on February 25, the smallest on the satellite record, it's also one of the earliest. Barring a late spurt of ice growth -- possible but unlikely, according to a NASA news release -- this sets a new precedent. The analysis is based on data from the NASA-supported National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Arctic sea ice, frozen seawater floating on top of the Arctic Ocean and its neighboring seas, is in a state of constant flux. It increases its area in winter, usually peaking between late February and early April, and then shrinks in the warmth of  spring and summer to reach its lowest extent in September. If this year's maximum extent, totaling 5.61 million square miles, was reached on February 25, it was reached 15 days earlier than the 1981 to 2010 average date of March 12, according to NSIDC. Only once before did the peak come earlier, by just one day in 1996. A peak of 5.61 million square miles is about 50,000 square miles below the previous lowest peak wintertime extent, reached in 2011, according to NSIDC. Scientists have been using satellite data to track changes in Arctic sea ice, a vital habitat for birds and marine mammals such as polar bears, seals and walruses, for over three decades. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ted Scambos, NSIDC lead scientist, puts the potentially record low maximum sea ice extent this year down to low ice extent in the Pacific and a late drop in ice extent in the Barents Sea. Strong southerly winds in early March also played a role, according to NOAA. Only the Baffin Bay area and the waters around Newfoundland had more ice than normal this winter, it said. Scientists say it doesn't necessarily follow that a low maximum winter extent will mean a record amount of shrinkage in sea ice over the summer, however. While the winter sea ice extent was low in 2006 and 2011, neither of those years saw an unusually low summer minimum, NOAA said. \"The winter maximum gives you a head start, but the minimum is so much more dependent on what happens in the summer that it seems to wash out anything that happens in the winter,\" Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is quoted as saying by NASA. \"If the summer is cool, the melt rate will slow down. And the opposite is true, too: even if you start from a fairly high point, warm summer conditions make ice melt fast. \"This was highlighted by 2012, when we had one of the later maximums on record and extent was near-normal early in the melt season, but still the 2012 minimum was by far the lowest minimum we've seen.\" Meanwhile, the summer minimum ice extent reached in the Antarctic was one of the highest recorded, NOAA said. But this isn't cause for much optimism faced with evidence of a warming planet. \"Over the span of the satellite record, Arctic sea ice has been declining significantly, while sea ice in the Antarctic has increased very slightly,\" the NOAA news release said. \"Recent research demosntrates that the Antarctic gains do not balance out the Arctic losses: globally, sea ice extent has decreased over the past several decades.\" According to the NSIDC, sea ice in the Arctic appears to play a more important role in regulating global temperatures than that in the Antarctic.", "abstract": "NASA has reported that the cap of sea ice that spreads across the Arctic Ocean in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year.

Each neighbourhood of the city is required to produce a 'falla' - a wooden sculpture that is eventually burnt. There are different speculations regarding the origin of the Falles festival. One suggests that the Falles started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of the broken artifacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called parots to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned. Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these parots was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters. The timing of the events is fixed and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential.

Joanne Dowsett had been drinking for hours when she returned to her parents' home in Stockport last October. Having downed ten shots of Sourz and rum and Cokes, the 20-year-old care worker took anti-nausea pills at around 3am, causing her to collapse and suffer a seizure. She was found dead the following afternoon at 4pm having rowed with her parents after being accused of taking drugs, an inquest into her death heard. Joanne Dowsett died after consuming a cocktail of alcohol and anti-sickness pills. The 20-year-old had 'no intention of taking her own life,' an inquest heard. On the night in question, Miss Dowsett had been in several pubs and bars with Joshua Beaumont on a date. The pair drank Jagerbombs, beer, rum and Coke and shots before Mr Beaumont walked her home. Giving evidence, the 22-year-old said Miss Dowsett had been acting normally when he bid her goodnight. 'Jo seemed to be fine, she wasn't slurring her words or falling,' he said. 'She asked me to walk her home and said she would phone me a cab from her house. We stood on the drive chatting together and we were discussing about going out again. 'She didn\u2019t seem to be particularly drunk.' After being collected from her parents' house in a taxi, Mr Beamont said the pair continued to talk over text. Shortly before 3am, Miss Dowsett told him she was going to bed before phoning another friend, Samuel Higginbotham. The 20-year-old care worker returned to her parents' house in Stockport where they rowed over her 'erratic behaviour', it was claimed. Joshua Beaumont said Miss Dowsett did not seem unwell when he left her at her parents' house to get a taxi. During their conversation she told him she had just rowed with her parents. John and Ann Dowsett were worried their daughter had been taking drugs after seeing her behave 'erratically', it was claimed. 'She was at home and couldn't sleep and knew I would be up. I asked about the date and she didn't go in to great detail,' Mr\u00a0Higginbotham said. 'She said her mum and dad came in after the date and she told them to leave. There was nothing else in the phone call that rang alarm bells or made me feel the need to ring her back.' In text messages to others Miss Dowsett had given mixed accounts of the date, telling some she was eager to see Mr Beaumont again and others that she wasn't interested. 'She said to some the date had been great and to others saying it had been less than great,' said\u00a0Det Insp Cheryl Hughes of Greater Manchester Police. 'Within texts to a friend by the name of Ben she explains the altercation with her parents where she had been accused of taking drugs but she said she hadn't had any drugs. 'Clearly Joanne had mixed emotions about the date where she is not telling the truth to each person she had contact with. 'Her behaviour in the early hours was erratic and gave rise to concern by her parents. 'We found no evidence she wanted to take her own life, in fact texts indicated she was going out for drinks on the Saturday night and she gave Mr Beaumont the impression they were going on another date.' The 20-year-old had fatal traces of the drug in her system. Police said there was no indication that she intended to take her own life. In text messages sent the night before she died, Miss Dowsett arranged to meet friends for drinks and a second date with Mr Beaumont. At 4pm the following day she was found face down in her bedroom. A toxicology report indicated she was just over the drink drive limit and had fatal amounts of cyclizine in her system. The drug is often prescribed to treat nausea and travel sickness. After searching her bedroom investigators discovered she had taken a substantial number of the pills. 'Whether it was deliberate or an accumulation is more difficult to assess. Fatality is very rare,' said toxicologist Julie Evans. While Miss Dowsett had been drinking, a pathologist concluded she died as a result of the cocktail of drugs and alcohol. Recording a conclusion of misadventure, coroner John Pollard said: 'She had taken alcohol for the buzz effect and one does hear of youngsters taking fairly prodigious amounts these days but I don\u2019t think she did anything unusual in the amount she took while she was out. 'Then you link that with the cyclizine. She has taken them to stop her feeling sick and an unintended outcome was they connected with the alcohol and have been more than her body can cope with.'", "abstract": "A 20-year-old care worker, Joanne Dowsett, died after consuming a cocktail of alcohol and anti-sickness pills.

Canada Goose has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket, coats and parkas. They have made America their new frontier, forging into the US clothing market with worldwide sales topping $176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade. In November last year it opened its own store in West Chelsea, one of New York's most prestigious shopping areas, and it also sells at high-end stores such as Barney's, Bergdorf Goodman,, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus.. Earlier this year it opened a new factory in Toronto to cope with soaring demand. Celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur-trimmed, down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go-to label for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite. Last year's Sports Illustrated cover featured Kate Upton wearing a Canada Goose jacket and little else. Other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included Hugh Jackman, the Wolverine star, and\u00a0Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton. It is endorsed by Ben Fogle, the British animal television show presenter, who has also spoken out against animal cruelty. But according to the legal complaint, seen by Daily Mail Online, consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase Canada Goose. In the document Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund has accused the company of, 'engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur.' The complaint attacks Canada Goose on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained. Distressed: A coyote is caught in a snare of the same type used by Canada Goose trappers. Snared: Campaigners claim that coyotes caught like this can take days to die. Canada Goose's website claims that the company is 'deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals.' It goes on, 'We never purchase fur from fur farms, never use fur from endangered animals, and only purchase from certified Canadian trappers.' These trappers are governed by the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards (AIHTS) and their pelts are purchased by Canada Goose through North American Fur Auctions (NAFA). According to Canada Goose the NAFA'monitors very closely' the practices of the trappers selling through it. According to Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund it does nothing of the sort. Instead, they claim: 'There is no mechanism within the NAFA to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which NAFA accepts consignment pelts.' NAFA, it states, does not monitor trappers. It is not an oversight body; it is a commercial fur auction house. Nor does the AIHTS bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in Canada Goose's claims. The AIHTS simply requires Canada to 'phase out' certain types of traps \u2013 traps, Animal Justice Canada claims, that are still used by the trappers selling to Canada Goose.

The company is accused of using coyote fur that is not ethically or humanely obtained, despite its claims to the contrary."}

A man has been arrested on arson charges after firefighters raced to his burning Colorado home and found'my wife is a cheater' scrawled on the outside of the house. William Lindauer, 31, was taken into custody hours after the early-morning blaze on Nelson Street, Arvada on Tuesday, police said. He made his first court appearance in Jefferson County court on Wednesday morning. Jail records show he is being held on investigation of first-degree arson, reckless endangerment, prohibited use of weapons, cruelty to animals and criminal mischief, ABC7 reported. His wife filed for divorce in October 2013 and it was completed on February 18, 2014, the channel reported. Property records list him at the address with Brianne Lindauer, 29. Neighbors said that three young children lived at the home but that they had not seen the woman or her children in weeks, ABC7 reported. The Arvada Fire Protection District said everyone in the home had been accounted for and there were no reports of injuries. After multiple calls from neighbors, the district responded to the home early on Tuesday and found it engulfed in flames. Blaze: Firefighters in Arvada, Colorado found the words 'My wife is a cheater' scrawled on a side of the home. Blaze: Firefighters were able to put out the flames but the home is significantly damaged by the fire. 'Upon their arrival, they were faced with a lot of fire that was coming from the front of the house as well as the back of the house,' spokesperson Deputy Fire Marshall Deanna Harrington told the Denver Post. Crews were initially unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the'very significant' damage, she said. They also found a\u00a0name had been painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire. After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps. Destroyed: Later on Tuesday morning, firefighters covered the graffiti outside the house with blue tarps. Debris was also found in the street, including patio furniture, fire officials said. Police said that investigations showed the fire had been intentionally set. The Arvada Fire Protection District and Arvada Police Department are conducting a joint investigation into the blaze. Neighbors expressed their shock over the incident. 'It's a younger family,' Fred Holman told KDVR. 'They've lived here about five years, maybe a little longer. They're very nice people, very good neighbors. I would never think anything like this would happen.'", "abstract": "William Lindauer, 31, has been arrested on arson charges after allegedly setting his family's home on fire in Colorado.

Reports in France on Wednesday claimed United officials had been in touch with their counterparts in the principality to inform them that there would be no move for the misfiring Colombian at the end of the season. But a source at Old Trafford told Sportsmail that no decision has yet been made on Falcao and added that none would be forthcoming until May. Manchester United will delay making a decision over Radamel Falcao's future until the end of the season. Falcao has just over three months to convince Louis van Gaal that he is worthy of a \u00a343m transfer fee. The 29-year-old, once one of the most feared strikers in the game, has struggled for form at United since he made the switch from Monaco in the summer. He suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury last January that saw him miss the World Cup and some have questioned whether he can return to the same level. Falcao penned a season-long deal with United but has scored just four goals in 20 appearances - a record that would appear to scupper any chances of his agreement being made permanent. However, an injury to Robin van Persie means Falcao is likely to get more chances to show manager Louis van Gaal why he should keep him at the end of the season.

My Bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize and displayed at Tate Britain in 1999. Now, 15 years later, it is back at the gallery on a long-term loan for at least 10 years. Scroll down for video. Artist Tracey Emin has insisted she is actually'very neat' as she unveiled her controversial \u00a32.54million unmade bed - complete with discarded condoms - on its return to its 'home' at the Tate Britain today. My Bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize and displayed at Tate Britain in 1999. Emin admitted that unlike the chaotic-looking installation, which features empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts, stained sheets and discarded underwear, her bed at home is now a different affair. 'I make my bed every day. It's so boring, it's very neat. I'm really OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder),' she said. Wiping away tears, the artist said that seeing the work - which is now subject to rigorous security in the form of a sensor and a guard to prevent visitors from getting too close - left her emotional. 'I'm 52 nearly. Even though I was quite old when the bed came into fruition I didn't look old or behave old,' she said. 'I'm a bit tearful, it means a lot to me. I feel pathetic but there are things on that bed that have no place in my life any more. 'That bed belonged to a young woman and hopefully in 20 or 30 years' time the bed will be here but I won't probably. 'That's what art's about. It's about a legacy, about making something which goes on without you. 'It's a statement of history and now it's in safe hands... it will never change.' The work, which expressed the artist's suicidal depression following a relationship breakdown, is displayed in its own room alongside two paintings by Francis Bacon and six nude drawings by Emin which she has given to the Tate. Emin said she felt validated seeing the installation on display alongside works by some of Britain's 'greats' after all the criticism about the bed at the time. The controversial artwork was created by Emin in her Waterloo council flat in 1998 and features empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts, stained sheets, discarded underwear, old slippers, a waist belt and even condoms. My Bed was one of the key works of the 1990s Young British Artists (YBA) movement and was bought by millionaire collector Charles Saatchi  for \u00a3150,000 in 2000 before later being sold to Christie's and auctioned. My Bed, which fetched \u00a32.54million at auction last year, is now on a long-term loan to the Tate Britain and will be shown at both Turner Contemporary in Margate - Emin's home town - and Tate Liverpool later this year. 'I love it, why wouldn't I? I was right... It's a good feeling... it feels like home,' she said, later adding that her fellow students at art school had 'thought I was a bit thick'. Earlier in the day, Emin had told photographers: 'I think I look like the cat who got the cream. I feel so happy.' She later added: 'My Bed is a symbol of that time. It was a zeitgeist. It was perfect for that moment. It has captured a part of history.' Pointing to her belt on the installation, she added: 'I would be lucky if it fitted around my thigh now and it used to fit around my waist. 'There are so many things about that bed that don't relate to my life any more. 'It's a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s in a really wild way. It's not just sad, but how that bed came about was through sadness. 'It's also about being in the worst situation in your life and being able to pull through and get out to the other side.' Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, said: 'It's a work we've always wanted to bring into the collection. 'It was quite clear from 1999 when it was first seen in the Turner prize that it was going to be regarded as one of those iconic works from the late 90s.' Emin insisted she was actually'very neat' as she unveiled the return of My Bed at the Tate today.

It is semi-derelict and the windows are boarded up, soon to be demolished as this notoriously tough Stockton-on-Tees council estate is redeveloped. A man repairing a garage roof warns our photographer to conceal his camera but there is barely a soul about. 'It still gets eventful on the evenings,' says Kilty, pointing out a black gate blocking an alleyway entrance, installed at the behest of police officers tired of suspects they were chasing disappearing into nooks and crannies. Sprinter Richard Kilty poses on the deprived estate where he grew up in Stockton-on-Tees. Kilty waves on the podium after receiving his 60m gold medal at the European Indoor Championships. The 25-year-old, who briefly retired from athletics in 2012, works out at Deny's Gym in Stockton-on-Tees. Kilty no longer lives on the estate after experiencing success on the world stage over the last 18 months. Age: 25. From: Stockton-on-Tees. Events: 60m, 100m, 200m. Golds: 60m - 2014 World Indoor Championships, 4x100m relay - 2014 Europeans, 60m - 2015 European Indoor Championships. Nickname: Teesside Tornado. 'It was usually just kids' stuff,' he says, but delve a little deeper and you realise how remarkable his rise has been from the deprivation of the Victoria estate to one of Britain's fastest men. A block of flats on the edge of the estate was a 'no-go zone' says Kilty, recalling mother Melanie asking him to rescue his younger brother Jack. 'I found him in a room with about 30 heroin addicts. They weren't physically intimidating, they only weighed about six stone but you didn't know if one of them was going to pull a knife on you.' In the moments before the 60metres final at the European Indoor Championships in Prague last month, Kilty glanced around the call room at his competition and his mind flickered back to life on the estate. 'I recognised the look of fear in their eyes, I've seen people in much more dangerous situations on the estate and they looked less scared than some of these athletes. 'On the evenings after I'd got home from school there'd always be fights. People would get stabbed or hit with hammers. We'd hang around in little gangs, that was just something you had to be part of. Kilty gets away from Pascal Mancini (left) and Christian Blum to win gold in Prague earlier this month. Kilty poses outside his local gym in Stockton-on-Tees after returning to the area where he grew up. Kilty shows off his 60m gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Poland in March last year. 'All of us have gone down different paths, my friend David drowned in a river, another friend just got out of prison for aggravated burglary with a gun. I've managed to run my way out of poverty so why should I be scared standing on a start line for a race?' A year to the day after winning the World Indoor Championships in Poland Kilty, 25, won his second international title. The circumstances were very different. He was favourite, whereas 12 months earlier bookmakers had made him a 33-1 outsider with Jamaican Nesta Carter in the field. Six-and-a-half seconds and 33 strides later his life had changed. 'I went there with \u00a317 in my bank account and by the time the plane landed back in the UK I had six figures \u2014 \u00a340,000 from winning the race, a British Athletics bonus and a four-year contract with Nike. 'I can remember sometimes not having much money for food and clothes. When I eventually do have kids I want them to live a comfortable life not like I did. I feel I'm doing a good job of that, a couple more years like this and I'll be OK.' He knows all too well what it's like to have it all snatched away. 'I've been homeless twice,' he says. 'The first time I was five and a half and we were put in a hostel up the road, six of us sharing a room in the same building with prostitutes, asylum-seekers and drug addicts.

Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite leader Len McCluskey, was suspended by Labour in 2013 and reported to police after allegations that the union had tried to manipulate the selection process in Falkirk in her favour. She was later cleared and had her membership re-instated, but she quit as Labour candidate in the Scottish seat for the sake of \u2018reconciliation and unity\u2019. Karie Murphy, pictured, was involved in the Falkirk vote rigging scandal in 2013 which led to her suspension.

Her possible inclusion on an all-women shortlist, to be announced on Tuesday, risks re-opening the wounds of the bitter Falkirk row just weeks before the election and is proving a headache for Ed Miliband. The Labour leader has been warned that his party risks losing the seat if Miss Murphy is selected, but the union could stop bankrolling the party\u2019s election campaign if she is not chosen. Unite has already mounted a strong campaign to ensure Miss Murphy is the candidate. Mrs Riordan, also a Unite member, has taken her on a tour of the seat to introduce her to local members. The pair have also been pictured campaigning with Labour councillors. Unite is also organising a campaign day in the seat on Sunday, two days before the candidates on the all-women shortlist are revealed. It is hoping to flood the constituency with members from all over Yorkshire and Humber in what is seen as a \u2018peacock exercise\u2019 to show off the resources it could deploy if Miss Murphy is chosen.

He dismissed suggestions that Mr McCluskey had threatened to halt funding Labour\u2019s General Election campaign if she is not chosen as \u2018complete and utter rubbish\u2019. Labour yesterday confirmed that an all-women shortlist would be decided for the Halifax seat on Tuesday, with the local party voting on its chosen candidate next Saturday. The shortlist is picked by the \u2018special selection panel\u2019, which Mr Miliband sits on. The announcement came hours after Mrs Riordan claimed the party had been \u2018dragging its feet\u2019 over the selection since she made her decision more than a month ago that she would step down on health grounds. In a letter to the party\u2019s general secretary Iain McNicol, which was leaked to the local paper, she claimed that there were suspicions the selection was being delayed so the party could impose its own candidate.

On Wednesday they testified before the state Assembly Judiciary Committee to ask lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow residents to carry loaded weapons on their person or in a car and still serve as foster parents. Their request was denied. Brian and Valerie Wilson of Las Vegas say they had always planned to become foster parents and adopt, but were shocked to discovered that they couldn't because of their guns.

The Wilson's bill would have allowed Nevadans with concealed-weapons permits, and law enforcement officers, to carry loaded weapons on their person in a home or car and still be eligible to be foster parents. If not carried on their person, the weapons would be required to be kept in a secure safe, but they could remain loaded.

It is only the second time in 63 years that the property has come to the market\u00a0and was home to Camilla's father Major Bruce Shand for 45 years. The former rectory was bought off him by actor James Wilby,\u00a0best known for his aristocratic roles in Maurice, Gosford Park and A Handful Of Dust, and his wife Shana. They decided to sell the home in August last year with a guide price of \u00a33.25million, but the couple have now dropped the price. Camilla has fond memories of the years she spent at the historic property with her siblings\u00a0Annabel and Mark after the family moved to\u00a0Sussex  to be near Sonia Cubitt, Camilla\u2019s maternal grandmother.

'This is a worrying trend that, if it continues, could easily move to five or 10 per cent and erode the excellent work done by the previous federal government to move women into board roles via its Boardlinks program,' Ms Braund said. Queensland posted the biggest loss of with a loss of 13.6 percent in the number of women serving on the boards of state owned corporations, while Western Australia followed with minus 3.2 percent.

{"article": "Fifty years after the bound body of a dairy farmer was pulled from a river, a new theory has emerged in the unsolved case of his death. Prosperous but unpopular dairy farmer Orville Gibson disappeared in the wee hours of New Year's Eve 1957 in Newbury, Vermont. Searchers pulled his bound body from the river nearly three months later. The case remains officially unsolved, but it's been widely accepted for decades that a small mob of drunken townspeople incensed by rumors that Gibson had beaten his elderly hired man kidnapped him, tied him up and threw him in a car trunk, where he suffocated. They threw his body into the river. Scroll down for video. The body of Orville Gibson (pictured) was pulled from a lake three months after he went missing. He had been bound at the ankles, and with his hands behind his knees. A new book claims that he staged an elaborate sucide. The crime was deemed a 'lynching' by editorial writers from Boston to Washington to the civil rights-era South. (All the players in Vermont were white, but white supremacists in the South used the story to cry they were being unfairly singled out for the mob killings of black men.) The story spread across the globe, even earning a feature in Life magazine. Orville Gibson was a successful dairy farmer who had many enemies in the community of Newbury. 'You can go anywhere, quite a ways off, and if you say you're from Newbury they'll bring it up,' said Eleanor Placey, 72, who was related to Gibson by marriage. Two men later went on trial but were both acquitted. So what really happened? Judge Stephen Martin, who as a new lawyer in 1960 helped represent one of the accused, recently published a book in which he argues Orville Gibson killed himself, with some ingenuity and difficulty, in a largely successful attempt to get revenge on his neighbors by pinning the blame on them. In Orville's Revenge: The Anatomy of a Suicide, Martin argues that Gibson, broken by the criminal charge he was facing in the hired man's beating and by the enmity he had created among his neighbors, staged evidence at his farm, walked over a bridge to New Hampshire, climbed out on a pier, tied himself up and rolled himself into the water. 'He was very proud, quick to hold a grudge, and his whole life was crashing down upon him,' Martin said in an interview. Martin has taken his conclusions to the Vermont attorney general's office, whose investigators plan to take another look. They could reclassify the case and remove it from the list of Vermont's unsolved homicides. Not everybody buys Martin's theory. 'I don't know why a supposedly intelligent man like Judge Martin would say that,' said Doris McClintock, 75, Gibson's niece, who still believes some of her neighbors know what happened to her uncle. McClintock and the Placeys offer-point-by-point rebuttals of why they believe Martin's book is inaccurate, getting basic facts wrong and ignoring others that don't fit his thesis. They speak of threats they believe were intended to keep people quiet, including one in which a note was stuck with a knife to a tree outside the home of a potential witness. Martin's theory isn't entirely new, but the book lays it out in detail. The idea that Gibson could have tied himself up was brought up during the second trial, but investigators didn't accept it. Gibson, 47 when he died, came to Newbury with his family as a child. He purchased the farm out of foreclosure several years before his death. Over the years, he built it up to be one of the richest properties in the fertile land along the river. But he never fit in. He and his wife weren't part of the partying crowd. He drew resentment for being the early bird at the courthouse to purchase his property, beating more established townspeople who wanted it. Orville Gibson's barn following his disappearance in 1957. Evidence of a crime, including depressions in a grain bag where it appeared two men had sat, drag marks on the floor and a crushed milk pail, was found. Widow Evalyn Gibson crying as she sees photo of husband Orville in the newspaper. His body, which had been bound at the feet and with his hands behind his knees, was pulled from the river three months after his disappearance on New Year's Eve 1957. Judge Stephen Martin demonstrates how it would be possible for someone to tie themselves up and roll themselves into the water. And then came the last straw \u2014 the story about the beating of his hired man. Gibson was charged with a crime, though some argue the man's injuries were exaggerated by the town rumor mill. The day Gibson disappeared, he had planned to visit a lawyer. Eleanor Placey's husband, David, now 71, responded the day of the disappearance to a call from Gibson's wife when her husband didn't return from the morning milking.

{"article": "Labour rounded on more than 100 of Britain's top business leaders today after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. But Ed Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Scroll down for video. Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa, (middle row)  and LK Bennett, (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland. David Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.' Mr Umunna went further dismissed it as a 'letter organised by the Conservative Party in a Conservative-supporting newspaper' after it was first published in the Daily Telegraph. But Mr Cameron, touring Marston's brewery in the Wolverhampton today, said the letter from business leaders was'very powerful'. David Cameron and George Osborne visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton today on the second full day of the general election campaign. Mr Cameron said the letter from business leaders was'very powerful' while the Chancellor claimed it was 'unprecedented' Tory officials said the number of signatories to the open letter (above) made it 'unprecedented' in the history of British general elections. He said: 'Today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best-known business, large and small, in our country saying the Conservative long-term plan is working, generating jobs. 'That is a very clear message from business leaders who, like me, care about jobs and wealth creation and prosperity and livelihoods in our country.' Chancellor George Osborne added: 'The warning from Britain's business leaders couldn't be clearer: a change of course will threaten jobs, deter investment, send a negative signal about our country and put the recovery at risk.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the letter was a tribute to the work of the Coalition government, and claimed an outright Tory win would \u2018pose a very real threat\u2019 to Britain\u2019s stability. The Lib Dem leader said yesterday: \u2018I read the letter carefully, it talks about what this coalition government has done, and I think the signatories to the letter are completely right in saying that about the last thing that this country needs, now that we\u2019re emerging from this long shadow of the economic crash in 2008, is a great lurch in one direction or another.' However, the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the signatories were 'not exactly representative' of the business community and should 'be careful what they wish for', accusing some of signing up 'naively' to a Tory stunt. The business leaders were particularly positive about Mr Osborne's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax, which fell to 20 per cent this week, having stood at 28 per cent when the Government came to power in 2010. 'David Cameron and George Osborne's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the UK is open for business. It has been a key part of their economic plan,' the business leaders said in the letter. 'The result is that Britain grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85million new jobs.'

Mihai Lacatos fleeced casinos across the country out of tens of thousands of pounds by making almost invisible dents and marks on playing cards, and is seen making the marks at Playboy Club in Mayfair. Lacatos committed the frauds during a six year spree in which he was living at different locations in the UK. He tried to flee the country after his slight of hand was discovered but was arrested as he got to the departure lounge of Luton Airport on November 20, 2014. He was found with around \u00a33,000. He admitted 14 fraud offences and four further charges of possessing false ID documents which date back to 2008. He is one of the first people to be convicted for a specific cheating technique called \u2018card marking.' Lacatos (bottom right corner) was captured on camera making the almost imperceptible marks on cards. The 61-year-old fleeced customers at casinos across the country - including in Leicester, Salford, Nottingham and Birmingham. Lacatos used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled his cheating went unnoticed for years. The bends and dents helped him identify what other players at the table for three card games were holding. Lacatos marked cards like the one above, so that the dents could identify the cards his opponents held. Lacastos targeted the Playboy Club in Mayfair in London and cheated players out of more than \u00a340,000. After he was spotted at the Playboy Club, parent company Caesars Entertainment contacted the Metropolitan Police's Gaming Unit who circulated his image to casinos across the UK. He was arrested on 31 March 2014 at the Rubicon Casino on Regent Street, Northampton after staff there recognised him and raised the alarm. Officers seized \u00a31,485 from him, but while on bail he duped at least another three casinos during the six year spree. Phil Ivey failed in his bid to get Crockfords Club in London to pay him \u00a37.7million in winnings. The High Court ruled Crockfords Club would not have to pay Phil Ivey \u00a37.7million in winnings last year because his 'edge sorting' technique amounted to cheating. Mr Ivey had tried to sue the casino for refusing to pay out. Bruce Koloshi admitted cheating at a casino in Louisiana, America, in 2014. He was found using infrared ink to mark cards, which could only be seen using special contact lenses. In 2011 a gang used a similar technique in Cannes to steal \u00a355,000 in two trips to the poker table. The group are believed to have used the scam at casinos across the continent. He was due to return to court in May 2014 but failed to turn up and detectives eventually tracked him down to Luton Airport where he was arrested as he tried to flee. Officers seized \u00a33,000 from him under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Lacatos hoaxed staff at the Rendezvous Casino in Southend-on-Sea, the Genting Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair and Maxim\u2019s Casino also in London and was convicted of fraud at all three premises. He also fleeced customers at the Rank Casinos in Leicester, Stockport, Salford, Swansea, Portsmouth, Nottingham, Sunderland, Birmingham, Walsall and London premises in Victoria and Bayswater.

The festival sprung to life for Paul Nicholls on day two and the son of Al Namix, who sports the same colours as his illustrious predecessor, has undergone an unusual preparation for the hurdling feature following three starts over fences.

Shark Hanlon\u2019s gelding was runner-up in the race last year when outstayed by Dynaste and I wonder, with hindsight, if jockey Andrew McNamara may have employed a more patient ride as he became a sitting target late on. A recent Punchestown romp should have put the selection spot-on and he could go one better this year and end the Irish hoodoo in this race. With the Willie Mullins stable carrying all before them, Vautour will be a popular order in the JLT Novices\u2019 Chase. However, he will be priced accordingly and VALSEUR LIDO (Cheltenham, 1.30) looks a sound alternative as he was reported to be a little ring-rusty when edged out by Apache Stronghold at Leopardstown last time. Hidden Cyclone, pictured during the Paddy Power Gold Cup in 2013, was rerouted for the Ryanair Chase. The selection had previously beaten that foe by an impressive eight lengths at Fairyhouse and appears to jump a shade more fluently than Noel Meade\u2019s charge, who remains one of the chief dangers. There will be plenty of tips doing the rounds for the Pertemps Network Final but TRUSTAN TIMES (Cheltenham, nap, 2.05) is a solid conveyance for a race of this nature and may run well at a big price. The nine-year-old lacks the profile of a number of his rivals, but was a creditable third in the race last year \u2014 beaten by just a nose and a neck \u2014 and looks to have been campaigned with just one race in mind all season.", "abstract": "Saphir Du Rheu, son of Al Namix, can make history with a win at Cheltenham on Thursday.

A food shop owner who was back using a food mincer less than an hour after it had sliced off the fingers of a part-time employee has been ordered to pay out more than \u00a325,000. Akthar Khan - who used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean the machine - was also handed an eight month suspended sentence after earlier admitting a single breach of health and safety regulations. Judge James Burbidge QC described Khan's management as 'woeful', and said: 'It is beyond belief the machine was still being used even after a man lost his fingers.' Birmingham Magistrates Court had previously heard Aston's Ash Food Fare's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before Mr Iqbal lost his fingers in October 2012. Staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage, the city's magistrates' court heard. Fellow workers heard Mr Iqbal screaming  as he placed his right hand inside the machine, which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop. A paramedic only recovered three of Mr Iqbal's fingers after the machine was dismantled. But an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it. Khan, 57, then admitted he had used Fairy Liquid. Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Abdul (the manager) said he used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean it, which was fairly inadequate. 'He then passed vegetables through it before using it. There was no safe system of work here at all. 'We have looked and we can't find any steps he (Khan) took to protect his staff from the unguarded mincer.' Simon Morgan, defending, maintained Khan, of Witton, Birmingham, knew nothing of the missing hand guard - but said he fully accepted responsibility and 'bitterly regrets the injury caused'. 'He is 57 years of age, has no previous convictions, he is very highly regarded,' Mr Morgan said. 'He has worked extremely hard all his life.' Mr Morgan said Khan had also carried out good work for the benefit of the community spanning two decades. Suspended: Khan, 57, was a 'woeful' manager, according to\u00a0Judge James Burbidge QC.

The researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse. A study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill and\u00a0researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse. After tracking 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010, the American team found that divorce levels were roughly the same between healthy couples and those in which the husband suffered sickness. But when disease hit the wife, the likelihood of divorce rose. Every two years the researchers interviewed the couples and asked whether either of them had been ill since their last session. Over the 18 years, 859 marriages ended in divorce, 32 per cent of the sample group. For 24 per cent of the couples, tragedy struck when one spouse died, and 44 per cent were still going strong by the time the study ended. But among the 965 couples in which the woman got sick, the rate of divorce was 6 per cent higher. Lead author Amelia Karraker, assistant professor in family studies at Iowa State University, said illness can add stress to a marriage because men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role as women. \u2018There is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you,\u2019 she said. \u2018That\u2019s something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage.

{"article": "(CNN)What a difference a couple of years makes. A federal judge has struck down Nebraska's ban on same-sex marriage, calling it an \"unabashedly gender-specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens.\" U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon's decision Monday means that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states. Nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Bataillon denied a state request to stay his decision. And so, beginning Monday the state must \"treat same-sex couples the same as different sex couples\" when it comes to marriage rights, the federal injunction reads. As the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages, the question now seems to be which state will be the last? The number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. States like Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York joined the fold voluntarily, while others -- most recently Nebraska and Alabama -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions. The case involving Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in June by the U.S. Supreme Court. Here's the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same-sex marriages:. The state's constitutional ban on gay marriage, passed in 2004, was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a U.S. District Court judge. Local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision, but the state Supreme Court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case. A decision could come soon. Georgia is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage. The other is North Dakota. However, lawsuits are pending to overturn the state's 2004 ban. The state's ban is being challenged in state court, where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional, and in federal court, where a U.S. District Court judge took the rare step, for a federal judge, of backing such a ban. The ban remains in place pending Louisiana's appeal of the state court ruling. On the federal level, a ruling is pending out of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in January. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the state's constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no \"legitimate purpose.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later overturned the ruling, reinstating gay marriage bans in Kentucky and four other states. The Kentucky ban is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case scheduled for arguments in April and a decision by June. A U.S. District Court judge ruled last year that the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, resulting in the issuance of more than 300 marriage licenses. That ended when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a stay. The court later reinstated Michigan's ban in the same ruling that reinstated Kentucky's ban. Its fate will be decided by the Supreme Court decision due by June. A state court judge ruled in November that Missouri's 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal. Attorney General Chris Koster appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. But that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Just a few days after that state court ruling, a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's marriage ban, but that decision has been stayed pending appeals. While the state ban is in effect, officials in the St. Louis area have issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. A U.S. District Court judge granted an injunction last year against the state's same-sex marriage ban, describing it as unconstitutional. The judge, however, postponed his ruling from going into effect to give the state time to appeal. A federal appeals court heard arguments in the case in January. In the meantime, the same-sex marriage ban is still in effect. Same-sex couples are challenging the state's ban in U.S. District Court, but a federal judge issued a ruling on January 20 delaying the proceedings until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules. U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban in January, but blocked enforcement pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The state's ban was struck down in January 2014 by a federal judge who said it serves \"no legitimate governmental purpose.\" But, as in many other states, enforcement was delayed pending appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard the case last month and a ruling is pending. A federal appeals court judge upheld a ban last year on same-sex", "abstract": "A federal judge has struck down Nebraska's ban on same-sex marriage, meaning that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states. Nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The case involving Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in June by the U.S. Supreme Court."}
{"article": "Police sought answers Wednesday from a retired correction officer after his dispute with a pair of strangers ended with a fatal shooting. Former officer, Willie Groomes, 69, shot Gilbert Drogheo at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, police said. Drogheo's uncle declared Groomes to be 'a murderer' on Wednesday night. Scroll down for video... Killed: Victim Gilbert Drogheo, 32, was killed after a scuffle on the 4 train on Tuesday night. Altercation: Cell phone footage taken by a witness and shared with CBS New York shows an older man approaching a younger man at the subway station and getting into a scuffle before a shot is heard. Terrifying: A blurred figure can be seen near to where the altercation occurred on Tuesday evening. He said that his nephew was a dedicated electrician. 'He was a great kid,' the uncle said. 'All he did was work,' he told the Daily News. Investigators took Groomes into custody on Wednesday but later released him without charges. The shooting \u00a0spread panic inside a subway station at the height of the evening rush hour when the retired officer, who's 69 years old, boarded a Brooklyn-bound subway train in Manhattan. He was armed with a small Ruger handgun that he was licensed to carry in public. According to witnesses, it appeared that the former officer angered Drogheo, 32, and another man by stepping in between them while they were talking, police said. Emergency: Ambulances carry away an injured man;\u00a0Gilbert Drogheo was pronounced dead in hospital after he was shot in the torso and the ex-corrections officer was taken away for treatment for a minor injury. The men and the officer argued before they pushed him down into an empty seat on the train, police said. All three men exited the train at the next stop in Brooklyn, where there was a second confrontation on the station's mezzanine level, police said. The retired officer tussled with Drogheo before pulling his weapon and firing one round, which struck the victim in the chest, they said. New York Police Department officers assigned to the station heard the gunshot and quickly detained the shooting suspect. Drogheo, who was from Harlem, died at a hospital. The other man was taken into custody. Television station WCBS broadcast a cellphone video showing a man it identified as the retired officer cornering a smaller man near an exit in the subway station and pushing him. The men are seen struggling before a gunshot is heard and bystanders scatter. Subway passenger Thomas Berry, who witnessed the dispute, told the Daily News the older man had initially tried to avoid trouble. Rush hour shooting: A 32-year-old man was fatally shot by a retired corrections officer during the shooting. Deadly confrontation: Witnesses said the fight began when the older man stepped between two men. The officer told the other two men, ''Leave me alone. Don't talk to me,'' Berry said. 'He was being really calm.' But as the dispute grew more heated, the older man flashed a gun, Berry said. 'Everyone said 'gun' and ran off the train,' he said. 'I was standing there in shock.' A cell phone video obtained by\u00a0CBS New York\u00a0revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard. Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground. He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. Fight: The 69-year-old gunman was reportedly heard telling his opponents, 'don't touch me' before the brawl. Tempers flare: The 69-year-old former jail guard got on the crowded train at Bowling Green station and was trying to walk past the duo when some words were exchanged. Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first. 'Like a 'pow, pow' sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: 'No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot'.'. Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it's Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.'", "abstract": "A retired correction officer, Willie Groomes, shot and killed Gilbert Drogheo at the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn after a dispute with him and another man.

Her father, Carl Mueller (right), addressed  the service with some assistance from Kayla's brother Eric (left) Arizona Senator John McCain spoke to about 500 people at the ceremony. Speakers at the ceremony reminisced about Kayla's quick wit and an overflowing heart. Kayla's father,\u00a0Carl Mueller, read a moving letter at the service, recounting his daughter's discovery that her life's purpose was to ease the suffering of others. Mr Mueller paused to regain his composure as he read the letter his daughter wrote while working an earlier job at an orphanage in India. As her father struggled to get through a particular passage, Kayla's brother Eric rubbed his shoulders. He quoted his daughter as saying: 'This is my life's work. But my family is my life.' Kayla's family members thanked the soldiers who risked their lives in a rescue attempt for her. They also tried to bring some levity to the ceremony and Kayla's father, dressed in a  dark suit and tie, made sure to lift up the legs of his pants to show off the rainbow socks he found in her room. Her parents have started a nonprofit organization called 'Kayla's Hands' designed to further her humanitarian efforts locally and internationally. Kayla was captured by ISIS in August of 2013 in Aleppo, Syria and held for 18 months before being killed. Kayla helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and worked the overnight shift at a women's shelter in Prescott. Sen. McCain's voice cracked with emotion as he delivered a short tribute to Mueller. He said 'I didn't have the privilege - the blessing - of knowing Kayla. I wish I had. 'I'd be a better man for knowing her. I'm sure of that. 'But her example of compassion and courage, her generosity, her unbowed humanity, have by her terrible sacrifice and her dignity in extremity reached so many people who did not know her as all of you knew her. 'We can try to give justice to her murderers' other victims and their families. 'But even if we succeed, and our retribution is swift and complete, we could not equal the rebuke that Kayla's life gave to the culture of death that robbed her of it. 'I never knew Kayla. That's my loss. But I won't forget her. That's my privilege and my responsibility.' Mr Mueller read a letter at the service revealing the discovery that Kayla's purpose was to ease suffering.

Other images showed Kayla as an adult, affectionately nudging her face on a horse's neck in one photo and, in another frame, bending down to smell flowers. In her hometown, Kayla helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and volunteered for the overnight shift at a women's shelter.

In new pictures of her Victoria, Victoria Beckham autumn/winter 2015 collection, a model poses in a bare room lying prone on the floor with her eyes closed, while in another she lies as though unconscious on a chair with  her head falling back behind her.

In one picture from Victoria, Victoria Beckham's new AW15 images, one model seems to play dead. In another picture she lies stretched out uncomfortably on a waiting room-style chair as though unconscious. This may be a yoga pose but there's nothing fluid about this posture in a drab claustrophobic room by a handful of tulips dangling from the letter box and in front of an old fashioned television. The label describes the sister collection as: 'Free spirited and fun - key features are made of classic fabrics such as ginghams, tweeds and leathers, which are twisted and played with to create new and modern statements.' Yet the pictures by top photographer Colin Dodgson look almost eerie, as a glum pale-faced beauty adopts a series of awkward poses in the beige, magnolia and pea soup-green room. In a number of pictures the model stretches out on the floor, with her eyes closed, her feet splayed out as though she's pretending to be unconscious. In one shot, in which she wears a lilac leather mini dress, she performs an uncomfortable-looking yogic backward bend in front of an old television with yellow tulips - said to represent cheerfulness - dangling out of the letter box. Another pose - again in front of the door - sees her adopting a listless forward slump.

The terror proposals are being drawn up by the Home Office amid growing concerns at the threat posed by home-grown fanatics. A Government counter-terror strategy would also lead to closer scrutiny of Sharia courts operating in the UK, and job centres would be required to help identify people potentially at risk of being radicalised. The raft of new measures were revealed in a leaked document published by the Sunday Telegraph, which calls on the government to be \u2018more assertive\u2019 in challenging extremism. It has been drawn up in the wake of worrying revelations about British Muslims going overseas to join ISIS including Mohammed Emwazi, the 26-year-old known as \u2018Jihadi John\u2019. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan admitted she was \u2018concerned\u2019 about what might be being taught in some schools. She told Murnaghan on Sky News: \u2018I\u2019m not going to comment on what is a leaked document, but I think as Education Secretary it would be right for me to say I am of course concerned about what might be taught in some of our schools. \u2018And we have since last year required all schools to actively promote these fundamental British values so that our education system is opening up young minds, it is not closing them down. \u2018And I think the messages that young people receive, whether it\u2019s in school or outside school, are very, very important.\u2019 The new strategy has not been signed off by ministers, and some of the measures could be expected to raise objections among Liberal Democrats if they are deemed to infringe civil liberties. It could lead to changes in the rules granting citizenship to encourage new arrivals to embrace \u2018British values\u2019. It also proposes a penalties scheme to encourage people on benefits to learn English. Schoolgirls Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum left the UK for Turkey to make their way to Syria to join ISIS. The document states that \u2018in the past, there has been a risk that the Government sends an ambivalent and dangerous message - that it doesn't really matter if you don't believe in democracy\u2019. It adds: \u2018We need to stand up and be more assertive in promoting our values and challenging the extremists who fundamentally oppose them.\u2019 \u2018This will include explaining our foreign policy (and) promoting mainstream voices supporting the quiet majority in all communities who oppose extremism.\u2019 The Home Office concluded that the so-called \u2018Trojan Horse plot\u2019 involving the infiltration of schools by extremists in the Midlands, was \u2018not an isolated example of schools where extreme views became prevalent\u2019. And it warned that universities, local councils and charities are vulnerable to \u2018entryism\u2019 whereby extremists deliberately secure jobs in particular institutions in order to promote their values.

The gala is billed as the most important annual conservation gathering of U.S. members of Congress, foreign heads of state, ambassadors, corporate executives, conservation legends, celebrities, and NGO and civil society leaders to celebrate conservation successes. Addressing the gala dinner, Charles praised the United States for its long term commitment to the environment, citing President Franklin Roosevelt who sought to protect the nation's wildlife and open spaces. He said: 'The world has looked to the United States for leadership in so many challenging circumstances in the past. 'However, today we are faced by truly exceptional challenges and threats - a veritable \"perfect storm\" which, if not met by strong, decisive and far-sighted leadership, could overwhelm our capacity to rectify the damage and thereby destroy our grandchildren's future inheritance.'

{"article": "He's the internet-savvy modern leader who cuddles up to kittens and hobnobs with film stars on his wildly popular Instagram page. But Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov is also a former warlord accused of running the Russian republic 'like a medieval tyrant'. The 38-year-old came to power in 2007 after a vicious armed struggle with a number of other Chechen strongmen and a political battle with the man he succeeded as leader, Alu Alkhanov. Claims that Kadyrov keeps a'murder list' of 300 names of people to be liquidated surfaced in 2008. Yet the brutal reality of how Kadyrov maintains his grip on power has been glossed over by his social media skills and voracious appetite for posting on Instagram. Scroll down for video.

He has shown a particular fondness for snaps of himself with cute fluffy kittens, baby birds, lambs and even tigers. In May 2013 he posted snaps of himself with Liz Hurley and a white kitten on Instagram after meeting the actress when she arrived in Chechnya to film thriller Turquoise with French actor Gerard Depardieu. The pair were seen  apparently bonding over the tiny animal having been introduced by Kadyrov's friend Depardieu. In another shot the Chechen strongman leans across the Austin Powers star and runs his finger over the smartphone she is holding as the two appear perfectly at ease with each other.

{"article": "There is evidence to prove that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle against peshmerga forces in Iraq, Kurdish authorities have claimed. It says peshmerga forces discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq on January 23. The Kurdistan Region Security Council says the chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second largest city of Mosul and the Syrian border. It was here that peshmerga fighters were desperately trying to seize the vital supply line used by the militants when they found the alleged weapons. Biological warfare: Kurdish authorities claim the 20 gas canisters found on board a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq (pictured) is further proof of ISIS using chlorine as a chemical weapon. Revelation: The canisters (pictured) were found on board the truck which exploded into a cloud of yellow gas after peshmerga forces opened fire on it. Explosion: The resulting gas cloud (pictured) left nearby troops feeling nauseous and many had to be treated for vomiting, dizziness and general weakness. Video provided by the council revealed a truck storming down the road with white smoke pouring out of it as peshmerga soldiers opened shot at it. The footage later showed a white, billowing cloud emerging from the truck as it exploded and its remnants scattered across the area. A Kurdish official said dozens of peshmerga fighters were treated for 'dizziness, nausea, vomiting and general weakness' after the attack. Traces of chlorine were discovered after samples of clothing and soil from the site were analysed, the Kurds claim. There have been several previous allegations that Islamic State terrorists have already used weaponised chlorine. In October, Iraqi officials claimed ISIS could have used chlorine-filled cylinders during clashes in the towns of Balad and Duluiya. And reports from the Syrian border-town of Kobani suggested the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already included heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases. The government said in a statement: 'The fact ISIS relies on such tactics demonstrates it has lost the initiative and is resorting to desperate measure. Evidence: Analysis of clothing and soil samples from the scene revealed traces of chlorine, Kurdish authorities claim. Dangerous: Chlorine is hazardous chemical that chokes victims and can long exposure to it can result in death. Chlorine was first used as a chemical weapon at Ypres, Belgium during the First World War to disastrous effect at a time when gas masks were not widely available. Jennifer Cole, Senior Research Fellow at defence think-tank Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that although chlorine can be lethal, it does appear that it's being used to spread fear by Isis. She said: 'Chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous \u2013 causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill. 'Used in roadside bombs such as this, in the open air, it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm.' Although it has many public and industrial uses, it chokes victims to death when used as a weapon. During the Syrian civil war, a chlorine gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in 2013 killed hundreds and nearly inspired the US to launch airstrikes against the government. The Americans and the West accused President Bashar Al-Assad's regime for the attack, while Damascus blamed the rebels. Even Al-Qaeda in Iraq - the militant group that eventually became ISIS - used chlorine gas in a suicide attack in May 2007. Insurgents drove tankers into three cities in Anbar province, killing two police officers and forcing over 300 Iraqi civilians and six US troops to seek treatment for gas exposure.", "abstract": "Kurdish authorities have claimed that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle against peshmerga forces in Iraq.

Perfect match: The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of cameras, while cradling their newborn between them. She continued to ABC News: 'He's been so supportive with me and we're just there for each other. I couldn't be happier for him.' Talking about how fatherhood had changed his life for the better, Johnson added: 'It's hard to describe, but just from the first day he's born, your perspective on life completely changes. 'Things that were important aren't important anymore. 'It kind of makes life a lot easier I think, just because there's just one thing that's kind of all you think about. It definitely simplifies stuff.' When Johnson announced his decision to step away from golf last July due to 'personal challenges', rumors about his lifestyle swirled, including the suggestion that he may have been suspended by the PGA Tour. Indeed, Golf.com reported that Johnson had failed three drug tests: one for marijuana in 2009 and two for cocaine, in 2012 and 2014. Johnson celebrates with Donald Trump as he holds the Gene Sarazen Cup after winning the WGC-Cadillac Championship WGC at Trump National in Doral.

However, the Tour - which had initially said it did not comment on rumors or speculation - released a statement saying Johnson had taken a voluntary leave of absence and had not been suspended. And in a news conference on Sunday when if he had ever failed a Tour drugs test, Johnson replied: 'No. Thanks'. In a candid interview with Sports Illustrated this January, Johnson revealed that alcohol was his real vice. He said he would excessively drink and party to relieve stress, with his tipple of choice being Grey Goose, soda and lime. In a bid to get clean, Johnson said he took time out from sport and concentrated on home life. Bundle of joy: Johnson's son Tatum Gretzky Johnson was born on January 19. Changed man: The golfer says fatherhood has helped him to put his bad boy party days behind him. Love birds: Johnson proposed to Gretzky in August 2013 - as of now, there are no reports of where and when a wedding will take place. Commenting on his time out, he said:\u00a0'I got to spend a lot of time with Paulina and help her as much as I could through her pregnancy, and then the birth of our son. 'I really enjoyed being able to be home and not having to leave or do anything. 'I was in the gym every single day, every morning, and then spend the rest of the time either I would go practice a little bit or just hanging out with Paulina.' Johnson returned to the green in Febuary at the Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines. As he won big on Sunday night, the two most important people in Johnson's life were waiting for him. He concluded: 'Paulina and Tatum were waiting for me when I got done. That was the best part of the day for sure.' 'My game is in good form. I feel really confident in my golf swing.

Natalia Kills, from Bradford, and her New Zealander husband Willy Moon, mocked aspiring singer Joe Irvine after he performed in a live show on Sunday. Kills, 28, accused Irvine, who sang Cry Me A River, of copying her husband\u2019s look of gelled-back hair and a suit. Sacked: Married X Factor New Zealand judges Natalia Kills and Willy Moon have been fired after launching a tirade of abuse at contestant, Joe Irvine, on Sunday night's episode. Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River. She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelg\u00e4nger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband. 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back. She added: \u2018You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' A shocked Irvine retorted: \u2018Don\u2019t you copy Cleopatra?\u2019 In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original. Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing. Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired. You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland. She told The New Zealand Herald: \u2018He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way. \u2018He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d He then snarled, \u201cThat was so rude\u201d as we both went into the bakery.\u2019 She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed \u2018you are such a c***\u2019. The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult. But Moon told the newspaper: \u2018I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.\u2019 In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer\u2019s letter, writing \u2018not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that \"statement\" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?\u2019 Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing. She wrote: \u2018Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!\u2019 X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair\u2019s behalf. Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates. He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.'

{"article": "The thought may have occurred to Sam Robson that there has never been a better time to be an England Test specialist. As the nation rakes over the debris of yet another World Cup fiasco, the Test squad named on Wednesday for next month\u2019s three-match series in the Caribbean will be depicted as English cricket\u2019s chance to start the clean-up operation. And though the Australian-born Robson had his first taste of the big time last summer, he has not represented his adopted country since the Oval Test against India in August. Selection for the West Indies \u2013 for the first of 17 Tests in 10 months \u2013 will almost feel like starting afresh, all over again. Sam Robson (centre) is ready to battle for his England place after a mixed maiden summer in Test cricket. Robson celebrated his first England century in just his second Test as he scored 127 against Sri Lanka. Robson\u2019s quest to resume his opening partnership with Alastair Cook will face competition if Jonathan Trott is deemed ready to resume his England career following his stress-related condition. But the prize is glittering on the horizon: the chance to help win back the Ashes this summer. \u2018To play in an Ashes series would be massive for me,\u2019 Robson told Sportsmail. \u2018I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t super keen. But there are five Tests before then, and I\u2019m hoping first and foremost to play in them.\u2019 Robson\u2019s first challenge will be to quell the chatter about his technique and nail the only spot in the Test batting line-up that remains up for grabs. After scoring a composed century in only his second game for England, against Sri Lanka at Headingley, he began the series against India with a steady 59 at Trent Bridge. But his fortunes ebbed. Six more Test innings brought him a top score of 37. And, as one of the few batsmen not to cash in against a mediocre Indian attack, he repeatedly found himself on the wrong end of the pundits\u2019 analysis. But Robson's judgement outside off stump has been questioned after dismissals caught behind and bowled. Robson tucks into the Indian bowling at Trent Bridge last July, but failed to notch a ton against the tourists. ROBSON. Tests: 7. Innings: 11. Runs: 336. Batting average: 30.54. Hundreds: 1. Fifties: 1. Top score: 127 (vs Sri Lanka) TROTT. Tests: 49. Innings: 87. Runs: 3763. Batting average: 46.45. Hundreds: 9. Fifties: 18. Top score: 226 (vs Bangladesh) Last summer, he was caught in the cordon five times, bowled four times and lbw twice. Experts made a simple diagnosis: Robson had a flaw around off stump. \u2018It is something I\u2019m conscious of,\u2019 he said. \u2018Knowing where your off stump is as an opening batsman is crucial. I\u2019ve worked on it just as I\u2019ve worked on other areas of my game. But I\u2019m not walking out there expecting never to nick another one. \u2018I was a little bit disappointed not to get another big score last summer after I\u2019d set myself a good base. But I still look back with pride on the 3-1 series win against India, and the Test hundred was something which made me feel comfortable with the environment. \u2018There was a very welcoming culture in the dressing-room, which helped all the young guys coming in. After the disappointing loss to Sri Lanka, that helped us turn things round pretty quickly. I\u2019m hungry if I get another chance to score some big runs.\u2019 While many of the colleagues he hopes to team up with in the Caribbean have spent the last few months confirming England\u2019s traditional struggle with 50-over cricket, Robson has been assiduously working on his game in South Africa with the ECB\u2019s performance programme and the Lions. And he reserves special praise for the coaching of Andy Flower and Graham Thorpe. \u2018I\u2019ve always been someone who likes to hear as many views as possible, especially from guys who have played lots of Test cricket, and then apply it to my own game,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the end you\u2019ve got to work things out for yourself. Jonathan Trott could be ready to resume his England career, which would pile pressure on Robson's place. The 25-year-old opener has been able to learn from Andrew Strauss and Chris Rogers at Middlesex. \u2018Andy talks a lot about your approach to batting \u2013 how to score runs, as opposed to just technique. If he notices something technical, he\u2019ll say it. But he doesn\u2019t just say stuff for the sake of it. He likes to keep things simple.

Ben Carson (above) said in an interview on Tuesday that he believes being gay is 'absolutely' a choice. The comments were made during an interview on the CNN program New Day when host Chris Cuomo asked the retired doctor if he did in fact believe that being gay was a choice. Carson followed up his comment by implying that something happens to incarcerated individuals while behind bars that makes them choose to be gay. 'So did something happen while they were in there?' he said. 'Ask yourself that question.' He then went in on the issue of gay marriage. 'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights -- property rights, visitation rights,' he said. 'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.' For this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote\u00a0ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Carson is in favor of civil unions. Carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech. In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. So he, it's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.' The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews.

{"article": "Investigators used a GPS device that was in a New Jersey man's vehicle to find the body of his wife, who had been missing since New Year's Eve, along the side of a rural road in Maryland, a New Jersey prosecutor said Wednesday. The body of Erica Crippen, 26, was found under branches and brush in Sykesville, Maryland, on Tuesday; she was wrapped in a blanket; her arms, legs and neck were bound with an electrical cord and duct tape was on her face and nose, Burlington County Prosecutor Robert Bernardi said. Crippen's husband, Kyle Crosby, 28, was charged in January with murder in his wife's death. He remained in jail Wednesday. Court and jail records didn't list a lawyer for him. Bernardi said that after Crosby's arrest, investigators found a GPS device in his Ford Taurus that contained 8,500 points, or what the prosecutor characterized as 'bread crumbs' that showed where the vehicle had stopped.

Charged:\u00a0Kyle Crosby, 28 (left), stands accused in the murder of his 26-year-old wife, Erica Crippen.\u00a0Crosby's 67-year-old mother, Jo Crosby (right), allegedly helped him. \u00a0She was charged with hindering and tampering with physical evidence. Finally found: The body of 26-year-old Erica Crippen (right) was found Tuesday underneath a pile of branches and limbs  in Carroll County, Maryland. Her husband, Kyle Crosby (left), had already been charged with murder. Scene:\u00a0The body of Erica Crippen, 26, was found under branches and brush in Sykesville, Maryland, northeast of Balitomore on Tuesday afternoon wrapped in a blanket. Crippen's body was found less than 100 feet from one of the points, Bernardi said. It's unclear how or when Crippen died but authorities believe Crosby dumped her body either on the evening of January 10 or morning of January 11, Bernardi said. An autopsy was scheduled in Baltimore. Investigators searched three times in Maryland for her body, but their efforts were hampered by the brutal winter, the prosecutor said. The couple lived in Mount Laurel with their infant daughter and Crippen's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship. Crippen's body was found the same week Crosby's 67-year-old mother, Jo, was charged in the case with hindering and tampering with physical evidence. Authorities allege Jo Crosby deleted several text messages from her phone sent to her son the morning police believe he killed his wife. According to an affidavit, at least 15 text messages between her and her son on New Year's Eve were retrieved during a forensic examination of their cellphones. The two also had an 18-minute phone conversation, according to an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request. Murder:\u00a0The Mount Laurel woman had an electrical cord around her neck and duct tape binding her hands and feet; the cold weather preserved the body, police said. Press conference: Mount Laurel Police Chief Dennis Cribben (left) announces the discovery of Erica Crippen's Tuesday, while\u00a0Burlington County Prosecutor Robert Bernardi announced charges against Crosby. Jo Crosby eventually admitted deleting the messages when she learned authorities were coming to interview her, the affidavit said. She has been released on $12,500 bail. It wasn't clear Wednesday if she had an attorney who could comment on the charges. A phone number could not be found for her. Crosby told Crippen's family he didn't know where his wife was the day after she went missing, however he didn't report it to police. Authorities only found out a week later when they went to the couple's home to check on Crippen's seven-year-old daughter, who had not attended school for the week. After being questioned, Crosby went missing. One week later he was arrested and charged with murder. Investigators said they found several items that had 'evidential value in connection to (Crippen's) disappearance' in the trunk of the vehicle. Following the arrest, Crippen's family spoke out about Crosby, saying he had been on a drug binge with a prostitute following his wife's disappearance. They said he sold some of her clothes in order to pay for the drugs. Tracked down: Erica Crippen was last seen at a New Jersey restaurant on New Years Eve.

Sinking: Seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus, causing it to tumble into the raging deluge below. The shocking video shows the bus grinding to a halt as it travels along the Amazonian mud track. With a flooded river running beneath the road, it becomes clear to the driver that the surface is rapidly disintegrating, so he decides to abandon the vehicle before it is too late. Seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus, causing it to tumble into the furious waters below.

'They asked me, could they? I said, `Yeah, I'd be thrilled to help out in any way I could,'' said Nash, a former Connecticut resident who now lives on her own in Boston with the help of part-time aides. Nash lost her nose, lips, eyelids and hands when she was mauled by her employer's 200-pound pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Connecticut. Doctors also had to remove her eyes because of a disease transmitted by the chimp. She later received new facial features taken from a dead woman. She also underwent a double hand transplant, but it failed when her body rejected the tissue. Now blind, Nash spends most of her days listening to AM radio and books on tape - lately, 'War and Peace' - in her modest, second-story apartment.

The incident took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where the patients were confirmed with the bacteria known as CRE. The revelation comes two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria. Scroll down for video. Four patients have been infected with an antibiotic-resistant'superbug' linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half-million people in the U.S. every year. The incident took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (above) in Los Angeles where the patients were confirmed with bacteria known as CRE. Cedars-Sinai said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the UCLA outbreak and launched its own investigation. However, the germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope  during procedures performed between last August and January. The hospital said there is no evidence other patients are at risk, but as a precaution, it sent free home-test kits to 64 patients who had procedures to diagnose pancreatic and bile-duct problems. Cedars-Sinai said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the UCLA outbreak and launched its own investigation. The germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope during procedures performed between last August and January (above illustration of how a duodenum is used during procedures) In recent years, hospitals across the country have grappled with cases of CRE, or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, with some linked to hard-to-clean medical scopes made by Olympus and other companies. The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs and can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients. Last month, two people died and 16 were hospitalized in North Carolina after contracting CRE at an unnamed hospital. The latest cases come two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (above) where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria. The latest infections were reported to state and local health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One patient died, but Cedars-Sinai said the cause was an underlying medical condition  not related to the superbug infection. UCLA and Cedars-Sinai said infections occurred at the hospitals despite cleaning the devices to the manufacturer's standards. Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics. They typically live in the soil or water. Patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic, but can develop pneumonia, kidney and bladder infections, and bloodstream infections. They began appearing in the U.S. roughly twelve years ago, and have since spread to at least 41 states. There is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria, which can linger in the body more than a year, and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent. Both have since implemented more stringent disinfection procedures, and Cedars-Sinai said it removed the contaminated scope from use and will resume endoscopic procedures after consulting with other hospitals and government agencies. In the UCLA outbreak, the hospital offered free testing to about 170 patients who were potentially exposed, and the hospital said Wednesday it does not have an update on the results. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it received reports of 135 patients in the U.S. who may have been infected by contaminated scopes between January 2013 and December 2014. On February 19, it alerted hospitals with a safety warning that even with thorough cleaning, the risk of infection may persist, according to CBS News. The agency has acknowledged that the design of the scopes can make them hard to clean, but it said pulling them off the market would deprive patients of 'this beneficial and often life-saving procedure.' Olympus Corp. of the Americas declined to comment on the Cedars infections. It previously said it is working with the FDA on the infection problem and providing guidance to hospitals.", "abstract": "Four patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have been infected with a superbug linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half-million people in the U.S. every year.

To mark the launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation, the Baggies will don a replica of the white kit worn in the 1968 FA Cup final win over Everton at Wembley. Astle scored the winner that day, his most famous Albion moment, and he will be remembered and honoured on 'Astle Day' at The Hawthorns for the Leicester game. Saido Berahino (left) and Darren Fletcher model the historic 1968 FA Cup final kit that West Bromwich Albion will wear in next month's Premier League match with Leicester in honour of club legend Jeff Astle. The white kit, which doesn't feature any sponsorship, will be worn on 'Jeff Astle day' when a new foundation will be launched in his name to raise funds for research into CTE, the condition that caused his death. A close-up of the special West Brom logo that will be worn on the white shirts. Jeff Astle was a prolific centre forward who scored 174 goals in 361 matches for West Bromwich Albion in a decade-long spell at The Hawthorns between 1964 and 1974. Known as 'The King' by supporters of the club, Astle's crowning glory came when he scored the extra time winner in the 1968 FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley. Two years later, Astle scored in Albion's 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the League Cup final, becoming the first player to score in finals of both English cup competitions at Wembley. Astle won five caps for England and was part of the squad at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. He passed away on January 19, 2002 at the age of 59, with a coroner finding that repeated minor traumas caused by heading the heavy leather footballs of his era were the cause of his death. Baggies fans applaud in the ninth minute of every game - No 9 was his shirt number - in tribute to him. His family will officially launch the Foundation, which will raise funds for research into CTE or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Astle died of the condition in 2002 at the age of just 59. The disease is normally linked to boxing but coroners at the footballer's inquest ruled Astle's brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather footballs in the 1960s and 1970s. The Justice for Jeff campaign was launched after this and at every game this season, Baggies fans have held a minute-long round of applause in the ninth minute as he wore the No 9 shirt for the club. The historic kit, modelled by club captain Darren Fletcher and striker Saido Berahino, features no sponsorship logos and the players will be numbered 1-11 as was tradition at the time. It is only the second time the Premier League have given special dispensation for a replica strip to be worn - the other was for Manchester United on the 50th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster in 2008. Jeff's widow Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire chose the Leicester fixture because they provided the opposition on Astle's debut for the Baggies 50 years ago.

Club chairman Jeremy Peace said: 'We promised at the start of the season to honour both Jeff and his family's efforts to raise awareness of an important issue by dedicating a home game to him - and it promises to be a special day. 'We are absolutely delighted the Premier League have granted permission for this kit change as an additional salute to a footballer who remains much loved. 'We are mindful that it is only the second time this has happened which I think says much about Jeff's standing and the gravity football places on the issues his death raised. 'We must not forget to also thank our sponsors Intuit QuickBooks and kit suppliers Adidas. When we presented them with the idea they immediately grasped the spirit of the project and graciously stepped aside. 'The one minute ovations for Jeff and the 'if in doubt, sit it out' campaign this season have been well supported by fans up and down the country and now the launch of the Foundation gives a new impetus to the family's efforts. 'There is a need to support the research required to understand more about the issues the Astle family have fought so hard to raise.

{"article": "Nick Clegg was accused of hypocrisy last night after it was alleged that a Liberal Democrat fundraiser had sought to bypass donation laws. Ibrahim Taguri told an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy Indian businessman that he would be able to channel money via family members and backdate cheques to avoid appearing on public registers. He was also said to have promised big donations could \u2018open doors\u2019 and introduced the fake donor to key figures including Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured, faces questions over his party's attempts to bypass donation limits. Mr Alexander was recorded at a dinner thanking the supposed businessman for what he was doing, adding: \u2018I won\u2019t intrude on the details, but genuinely it will make a difference.\u2019 All donations of \u00a37,500 or more are supposed to be publically registered. Last night Sir Alastair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Mr Clegg\u2019s high-minded rhetoric on sleaze was not matched by his party\u2019s actions. \u2018The leader of the party has always taken a stand on high standards in politics,\u2019 he said. \u2018There\u2019s a conflict between what he says, and what his party is doing. \u2018Any attempt to breach legal rules around party donations is a very serious matter. It is most unfortunate that the Lib Dems seem to be encouraging people to get round the legal provisions of party funding rules. You\u2019d expect higher standards and better leadership.\u2019 Last night it emerged that the Lib Dems had agreed to hand back Mr Taguri\u2019s Commons pass after accepting he should not have had one as it raised the prospect of him using the Parliamentary estate for fundraising purposes. Sir Alastair said: \u2018It is against the rules to carry out party political campaigning in the Commons, so allowing him to have a pass could be in breach of the rules. You\u2019d class fundraising as party political campaigning.\u2019 Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, pictured, thanked the undercover reporter who posed as a wealthy Indian businessman who was seeking to pump money into the Lib Dems for the election campaign. Lord Ashdown, the party\u2019s election campaign leader, admitted that Mr Taguri \u2013 who yesterday quit as the Lib Dems\u2019 general election candidate in Brent Central and is now likely to stand as an independent \u2013 had \u2018serious questions to answer\u2019. Mr Clegg told LBC Radio that Mr Alexander had done nothing wrong, save being polite to someone to whom he was introduced. The Deputy Prime Minister said the recording showed \u2018Danny being a polite guy, just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party\u2019. \u2018The idea that Danny or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue,\u2019 he said. \u2018On the issue of Ibrahim Taguri, no cheque has been received by the Liberal Democrats, no cheque has been cashed. If we had received this cheque in question, of course it would have been scrutinised and checked.\u2019 Mr Taguri, who has also stepped down as the Lib Dem race equality champion, denied any wrongdoing and said he was \u2018confident that I will be exonerated of all the claims made against me\u2019. He intends to fight the election as an independent but said he hoped to return to the party fold after clearing his name. The undercover reporter was apparently able to secure meetings with senior figures including Mr Alexander after giving several thousand pounds and promising far more. He was introduced to figures such as Lord Ashdown, taken to Mr Clegg\u2019s office and attended a dinner for major party benefactors where he met Mr Alexander, the newspaper said. The fake donor is alleged to have been told by Mr Taguri that he could channel a donation via a \u2018cousin\u2019 after explaining that he wanted to remain \u2018discreet\u2019 about his financial support. He went on to hand over a cheque for more than the \u00a37,500 threshold beyond which donations must be publicly registered with the Electoral Commission. Commission guidance, issued in 2007 in the wake of a scandal of \u2018proxy\u2019 donations to Labour, says giving money via a third party \u2018must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency\u2019. Backdating a cheque could have allowed the donor to split the gift into smaller amounts of less than \u00a37,500 \u2013 thus allowing him to evade declaring his name. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: \u2018We are aware of what\u2019s been reported and are establishing the facts before determining what further steps to take.\u2019", "abstract": "The Liberal Democrats have been accused of attempting to bypass donation laws after an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy Indian businessman was told by a fundraiser that he could channel money via family members and backdate cheques to avoid appearing on public registers.

{"article": "A single mum is desperately saving every cent to fly to the U.S. for her three-year-old daughter's ear to be reconstructed so she doesn't get bullied about the birth defect when she starts school. You would never know to meet Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl. The adorable little girl may only be able to hear from her left ear but that doesn't doesn't stop her great love for music and dancing. But her mother, Tanya Byas, has been on a mission since her daughter was born with microtia to get to California for Autumn to have an operation because she can't have surgery in Australia until she is 10 years old - in seven years' time. Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, was born without a right ear due to a\u00a0congenital deformity. Her mother, Tanya Byas (right), has been on a mission to get to California for her daughter to have an operation because Autumn can not have surgery in Australia for another seven years until she is 10-years-old. Autumn loves music despite being deaf in her right ear. The condition, that affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births, is treated differently in Australia with medical professionals using rib cartilage from the 10 year-old patient to recreate the ear, which takes six months to recreate. However in America, the surgical technique uses a synthetic framework and the body\u2019s own tissue to create an ear during the eight-hour operation, meaing there are no age restrictions. 'They will use her good ear as a template and make it out of synthetic material but make it a bit bigger because ears only grow a little bit so when she grows up they will be even and they use her membrane skin to cover it,' Tanya explained. Autumn will also need a jaw reconstruction when she is about 12 or 13 years old. After scrimping, saving and fundraising, Tanya has booked her daughter in for the operation on June 2 but she is $20,000 short with just 10 weeks to go. Although Autumn is deaf in her right ear, she speaks well and has no other health complications but her mother's worst fear is that she will be tormented when she starts school in two year's time for looking different. You would never know to meet Autumn that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl - pictured at her dance class. 'With school and bullying the way it is at the moment - life is hard enough,'\u00a0Tanya Byas said. 'She is so outgoing and free-spirited - it doesn't hold her back - she just goes about everyday life and I don't want that to change.' Paul Stanley from KISS was born with the same condition and was teased at school, and although it didn't stop the guitarist from succeeding in one of the most famous rock bands in the world, he still went ahead and had the reconstructive surgery in 1982 - almost a decade after the band formed. 'I read that he got called things like a \"one-eared freak\" when he was at school and I don't want Autumn to get called that,' she said. 'As much as I can teach her to be strong - it would still be tough.' Tanya's fear is that her daughter will be bullied when she starts school in another two years. A fundraiser is being held on Saturday to help with the last $20,000 needed for the $50,000 surgery. Life has been tough for Tanya, 39, who works full time as a sales coordinator, while her parents look after Autumn and has done without so she can put as much as she can towards her daughter's surgery. When Autumn was one-year-old, Tanya held a fundraiser dinner which raised $17,000 and she has managed to save $13,000 of her own money. She has also managed to pay for airfares and accommodation for the month-long trip. 'It's been hard because we can't do everyday things that people take for granted like going out to lunch or taking a trip,' she said. 'We went to the zoo last month but only because our friends had a free family pass.' But, Autumn still gets to do fun activities like any other kid such as swimming and dancing lessons which she relishes. The condition, Microtia, affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births. With still $20,000 to go, Tanya is holding another fundraiser dinner this Saturday in the hope to raise the last of the funds for the surgery. 'I haven't even thought about what I will do if we don't raise the funds - I will have to get it from somewhere even if I get out a loan I guess,' she said. 'It will change Autumn's life", "abstract": "A single mother from Sydney is raising funds to fly to the US for her three-year-old daughter's ear to be reconstructed so she doesn't get bullied about the birth defect when she starts school.

{"article": "A son whose no-nonsense dad gave him a fitting punishment for being a bully - and sent his story viral - has seen the error of his ways. Kayden Robenhorst, 13, said 'thank you, I deserved that' to dad Timothy, who surprised him with a run, 60 push-ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing Green Bay, Wisconsin, after finding out he'd been mistreating a classmate. A photograph showing Kayden and Timothy posing with a sign explaining his sentence has been shared thousands of times online. Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him. Just desserts: Kayden, 13, is pictured above in the midst of a 'knuckle push-up', part of his grueling punishment. From above: Kayden said of the punishment 'I learned my lesson, and he's a good dad for doing it' Another condition of the punishment is that it remains Kayden's own Facebook profile picture and cover photo until Robenhorst relents. The surprise punishment, carried out Wednesday in 32-degree weather, came after Timothy got wind that his son had insulted a classmate, and later pushed him into a locker while walking between classes. Robenhorst, who heard what had happened from friends, decided not to let his son know in advance, but sprang the punishment on him at 4am. Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs. After sitting him down and explaining what was about to happen, he dressed him up, stood over him during the push-ups then sent him out on the run. Describing the experience to DailyMail.com, Kayden said: 'It was stupid of me - I saw a kid and said a stupid, random comment.' 'When he found up, he woke me up at 3:30 in the morning, and he sat me down on the couch. And when I didn't come up with a good enough excuse to save my butt, I told the truth. 'He made me do 50 knuckle push-ups, run a mile, then come back and do incline push-ups. And I'm still not done.' 'I think it's a really good punishment - I learned my lesson and he's a good dad for doing it.' The two planned to have Kayden apologize to the boy in question in front of his whole class, but school authorities decided a private meeting would be a better solution. Kayden also apologized a second time when there were no teachers and parents around. Speaking about his high-profile parenting, Robenhorst said: 'He understood - he knows it was wrong and there have been no hard feelings since.' 'He actually has said \"Thank you, I deserved that, I understand it was wrong.\" I believe he also apologized to the child another time the other day.' 'He didn't question his punishment - he had a look on his face, you can see he wasn't very happy when he was getting his picture taken - but it's been successful.' 'And seeing it go around the way it's been going around - I would do anything to put this out there and say \"Hey, don't let your child get away with this crap\". Even small bullying can turn into something big.' Apology: Kayden was made to say sorry to his victim in front of his whole class at Pulaski Middle School, pictured. Kayden, who lives with Robenhorst, who is a business consultant, and his wife, used to live with his mother in South Carolina, where he had a difficult past. But his father said he has seen him transform since coming north, and is now doing well at Pulaski Middle School. Under the original post, Robenhorst had written: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it. 'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully! 'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere! Nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution!' Kayden concurs, adding: 'It's a good message and I hope lots of people see it'.", "abstract": "A father in Green Bay, Wisconsin, punished his son for bullying a classmate by making him do a run, 60 push-ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing weather.

{"article": "Lib Dem Care Minister Norman Lamb has been through the ordeal of his son being 'blackmailed' A minister last night told how he became drawn into a 'nightmare' blackmail plot over a video of his son taking cocaine. Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem Care Minister, had to call the police after his son Archie's flatmate demanded cash from him and sent threatening messages. He paid the lodger \u00a37,500 to move out but says the man then tried to ruin Archie's career in the music business. Mr Lamb, 57, said: 'This man has a violent past. We were worried for our safety.' As his party unveiled the \u00a31 billion boost to mental health services that Mr Lamb has campaigned for, the senior MP admitted his son has been through'very dark periods'. Archie, now 27, was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder at the age of 15 and has been on medication ever since. He went into the music industry, founding a record label called Takeover Entertainment and becoming an early champion of rapper Tinchy Stryder, who went on to top the charts. But his father said that Archie had also fallen in with a bad crowd, leading to the blackmail attempt. 'He's had amazing success and he's also had some very dark periods, and that led to him drinking too much and, as we understand it, getting into bad company and drugs,' said the North Norfolk MP. Mr Lamb added he was 'immensely proud' that his son had escaped from his problems and rebuilt his career, and bought him a London flat where he could find 'peace and tranquillity'. But then the alleged blackmailer, who is also thought to be 'the source' of the drugs that Archie took, moved in. Mr Lamb took legal advice on how to evict his son's flatmate and was told he should offer him \u00a37,500 \u2013 money his son owed plus compensation for having to move out. Archie Lamb (left) with rapper Tinchy Strider.\u00a0Mr Lamb said he is 'immensely proud' his son had escaped from his problems and rebuilt his career before the recent alleged blackmail attempt. Despite handing over the cash, the tenant refused to leave \u2013 'and at that point I concluded we were being blackmailed and we had to go to the police,' Mr Lamb told the Sunday Mirror. He found out just last week that the man said he had a video appearing to show Archie snorting the Class A drug. 'This guy sought to blackmail my son,' the Minister said. 'We were confronted with threatening emails, text messages saying things like 'underestimate me at your peril'. We have been confronted by a criminal who has sought to blackmail us.' The Sunday Mirror said the former flatmate insists he was simply trying to recover money he was owed. Police are reportedly looking into the case. The senior Lib Dem referred to the issue when he took to the stage at the party's spring conference in Liverpool. He said: 'Before I begin my speech I just wanted to say a few words about.

As a parent you just want to keep your children safe, to look out for them and to know that they are going to be OK. 'But my family is not unique. Our experience has made me even more determined to bring mental health out of the shadows and to fight for better care for all of the families affected.'

The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA World Player of the Year, beating Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to the accolade that season, has selected the best eleven players he has played alongside or against for Sportsmail. It is a diverse mix of astonishing ability and experience from the different eras his career has spanned to date, from his humble beginnings at Sao Paulo in 2000 to joining MLS side Orlando City in 2014. Playing for AC Milan twice and Real Madrid in between has meant there are few of the planet's superstars of the past 15 years that he has not played for or against. In a team packed with stars, there is no place for Lionel Messi in his side. Here, in his own words, Kaka takes you through his best XI.

KAKA'S TOP FIVE GOALS:\u00a0From a solo strike against Man United to a deflected free-kick for new side Orlando City. GOALKEEPER. Dida. I played with Iker Casillas for four years at Real Madrid, but for me Dida is the best goalkeeper. We played together and won together at AC Milan and for the Brazil national team. He is an unbelievable keeper. Goalkeeper Dida, pictured making a save at the 2006 World Cup, played with Kaka for Brazil and AC Milan. DEFENCE. Cafu. Every time I have to say something about players that I've learnt a lot from, I talk about Cafu. He won the World Cup twice and the Champions League, but still he worked every day to win. His motivation was always victory in the next game. Cafu, pictured kissing the 2002 World Cup in Japan, played for Brazil for 16 years before retiring in 2008. Paolo Maldini. He is similar to Cafu. He won five Champions Leagues, he won Serie A seven times, he won so much, but he was always the first to arrive and the last to go home from training. He was the perfect example to a player. AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini (left) led the Serie A club to both domestic and European glory across 24 years. Alessandro Nesta. The Italian players, they see the game in a different way to other nations. They grow up learning about tactics so when they play professionally they can see where to position themselves and how to move and what the opponents will do. It made Nesta such a strong defender and he was so quick, too. Alessandro Nesta (left) tussles with Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt during the 2007 Champions League final in Athens. Roberto Carlos. What an amazing player he was. So exciting at left back. I enjoyed playing with him. He was quick, strong and could hit some unbelievable free kicks and shots at goal. Roberto Carlos (left) became one of the world's finest full backs with Real Madrid and Brazil. MIDFIELD. Andres Iniesta. He makes the toughest things on a football pitch look easy. That's the biggest compliment I can pay him. How he plays, everything seems so simple. This is what I like about him. Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta brings the ball forward during Sunday's clash with Real Madrid. Zinedine Zidane. I never played with Zidane, just against him. It was wonderful how he played, how he moved around the field. It was like he was gliding. What he could do with a football, it was sometimes impossible to imagine. Zinedine Zidane (centre), pictured in action in 2005, is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Andrea Pirlo. I loved to play with Pirlo. I think he's one of the greats. He sees the action before anyone else does on the pitch. My position was to play behind the lines, and he found me every time he could find me. Andrea Pirlo, pictured playing for Juventus this season, starred alongside Kaka at AC Milan. ATTACK. Cristiano Ronaldo. I will have the three Ronaldo's up front, starting with Cristiano. I learnt a lot from him, which helped in my career, when we played for Real Madrid. He is the best player on the planet at the moment, a special player. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring for Real Madrid in Sunday night's El Clasico at the Nou Camp. Ronaldo. For me, the Brazilian Ronaldo is one of the best strikers in the history of the game.

{"article": "Dusan Tadic ensured that Southampton remain the spot-kick kings of the Premier League with his penalty against Chelsea on Sunday. The Saints have a near perfect record when it comes to penalties in the Premier League era, scoring 52 of their 55 kicks for a 95 per cent success rate. During their time in the Premier League they have had two of the best penalty takers around. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Matt Le Tissier was the designated penalty taker \u2013 and his career record was 47 goals from 48 kicks - which is one reason why their record is so impressive. Dusan Tadic scores from the spot against Chelsea - Southampton's 52nd success in the Premier League era. Matt Le Tissier only missed one penalty during his career - against Nottingham Forest in 1993. His sole failure to score came in March 1993 in a match against Nottingham Forest, his effort being saved by keeper Mark Crossley. Since promotion back to the Premier League in 2012 they had Rickie Lambert with a perfect record from the spot - six from six in the Premier League before his transfer to Liverpool. Of the teams who have been ever present in the Premier League since its inception back in 1992, Chelsea have the best record with a success rate of 88 per cent (99 goals from 113 penalties). Dennis Wise beats Everton keeper Neville Southall from 12 yards back in 1997. Manchester United's Eric Cantona was one of the most accurate penalty takers in the Premier League.

Jacqui Smith, a Labour former Home Secretary, said yesterday: \u2018We can \u2013 and should \u2013 dismiss the outrageous apologists of Cage who claimed that Emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities.\u2019 The backlash continued with Amnesty International coming under pressure to cut its ties with Cage. A former employee urged the charity to stop treating the group as human rights defenders and heroes. Gita Sahgal, a former head of Amnesty International\u2019s gender unit, was forced out of the organisation in 2010 after describing Cage as jihadis and questioning the championing of former Guantanamo inmates.

{"article": "(CNN)During a conversation with a professor at an Ivy League college, a mother nudges her daughter to share how she's president of her school's \"survivors-of-bulimia\" group. Hoping to impress the Yale admissions committee, a student writes an essay about the time she was so engrossed in a discussion with a French teacher she admired that she urinated on herself instead of interrupting the teacher or leaving the room. Looking to give their child an edge, parents hire a college admissions consultant when their child is in the eighth grade and know the total tab will be roughly $50,000. How I wish I could report that those three nuggets were pure fiction, morsels from my imagination for a great storyline for a novel or television series. But sadly, they are all-too-real examples included in a provocative new book \"Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania\" by award-winning New York Times op-ed columnist and bestselling author Frank Bruni. Those examples, Bruni said, should really be \"wake-up calls\" for any parents or students currently engaged in, or one day likely  to be consumed by, the \"What school will I get into?\" annual game. \"This says that we are attaching a level of importance to this that is just completely bonkers,\" Bruni said during a recent interview. Student goes 8 for 8 in Ivy League college admissions. For many families in the United States, the challenge isn't getting into the right college. It is being able to afford the school of their choice, or any school for that matter. But for many middle- and upper-income families, the college admissions process is as frenzied as ever with the belief that one school can make or break a child's future. I had to ask Bruni, whom I met during my time covering presidential politics, how exactly college admissions became so insanely intense and ridiculously competitive. We both laughed that the process was definitely not nearly as manic or as charged when we both went to college in the '80s. Bruni points to a number of factors all mixed together, creating \"this kind of perfect storm of just absolute fixation, panic, etc.\" about where kids are going to go to school, whether it's exclusive enough and whether they've \"breached the inner sanctum.\" There's the economic pessimism over the past decade, combined with a widening chasm between the haves and have-nots, he said. \"I think all of that has made parents feel anxious on behalf of their kids and has made them feel like their kids have to have anything that might be a leg up, and if an elite school is a leg up, well, then dammit, let's get them that.\" Adding to the dangerous brew, says Bruni, is the \"whole test prep and college coaching industry.\" Yes, it has become an industry, with parents and students willing to pay thousands of dollars to consultants for an extra edge. That \"industry\" didn't exist just three decades ago when Frank and I were applying. 5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education. The final piece of the puzzle are the colleges, which have essentially become businesses, marketing themselves and using their acceptance rate as a bragging right. \"So when you have colleges drumming up extra applications so that they can then claim an acceptance rate below 15%, that becomes part of the discussion that adds to the anxiety because you look at these numbers and you think, 'Oh my God, if I don't begin doing SAT prep as a freshman in high school, if I don't hire the private tutor,' \" I won't get in -- or so the thinking goes, said Bruni. But how much does where you go really determine how successful you will ultimately be? Consider the Fortune 500 and the alma maters of the heads of the 10 companies with the highest gross revenues back in the summer of 2014. There was only one Ivy League school on the list (Dartmouth), Bruni says in his book. When you look at the Fortune 500 executives in the top 30, you see Cornell, Princeton and Brown, but also the University of Central Oklahoma, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Minnesota, he writes. The point is there isn't one exact path to the corner office, and an Ivy League degree or a degree from another prestigious private university is neither a requirement nor a guarantee. National politics is another case in point. Sure, there are presidents who hail from the Ivies (George W. Bush, Bill Clinton) but there are many who don't: Ronald Reagan went to Eureka College, a small school in Illinois, and Richard Nixon got his undergraduate degree from Whittier College in Southern California. Looking at other national politicians who either ran for or could run for president someday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Vice President Joe Biden graduated from the University of Delaware, Paul Ryan from Miami University of Ohio and John Edwards from North", "abstract": "The college admissions process has become increasingly competitive and intense, with parents and students willing to pay thousands of dollars to consultants for an extra edge.

She also claims that she does not believe it was solely the fact that she was single that caused this shocking service. 'I didn\u2019t fit their decor in there,' she said. 'I was the only African American.' And so, she ended up leaving the establishment. 'I cried, I\u2019ve never been so embarrassed and humiliated in my life,' she said. Owner Enzo Lanzadoro (above) claims he would never refuse service to a customer, and that they simply asked to move her to the bar. The owner of Enzo's, Enzo Lanzadoro, disputes these statements however, and tells a far different story. He shoots down the claims of racial discrimination and says that they simply asked Hampton to move to the bar and give up the table as it was such a busy night and they needed the space for another couple after her husband failed to show. 'The waiter came over, I\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s a busy night, we need to move you to the bar because we need the other chair,' Lanzadoro said. 'It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s night.' Hampton says this never happened, and that she was so excited to eat at Enzo's that she would have gladly taken a seat at the bar. Lanzadoro said she is free to stop by the restaurant any time to try and work things out, and that he would never refuse service to a customer.", "abstract": "A woman is suing a restaurant in Portland, Oregon, for $100,000 after claiming they refused to serve her when she showed up for her Valentine's Day reservation alone.

The 72-year-old was forced to crash land his vintage plane on a Venice, California golf course Thursday afternoon after the engine failed.

{"article": "England prop Mako Vunipola will be gripped by anticipation as Saturday's decisive RBS 6 Nations clash with France nears its climax, knowing he could have a critical late role to play. Wales and Ireland are also competing for the title on an afternoon of staggered kick-offs that promises a nerve-shredding conclusion to a Championship that will almost certainly be decided by points difference. Favourites England are in the driving seat as they will be aware of the target they require if they are to lift a first piece of silverware under head coach Stuart Lancaster, raising the prospect of a pivotal final quarter at Twickenham. Mako Vunipola (right) is anticipating a tense Six Nations finale when England play France on Saturday. Stuart Lancaster's England side could win the Six Nations, with the World Cup later on in the year. Vunipola cold be unleashed to help England get extra points against France in the final moments of the game. It is in the midst of this scenario that explosive front row Vunipola will be summoned from the bench and ordered to wreak as much havoc as possible for the brief time he is on the pitch. 'The last 15 minutes against France could be the most crucial spell of our Six Nations so far, so we know we have to come on and make a difference,' Vunipola said. 'As a bench we're always trying to have an impact on the game. When you're coming on in the last 10-15 minutes, there can't be any excuses like you're tired. 'Every replacement player gets restless in that second half. We all want to get on as soon as possible and get ourselves into the game. 'Around the 60-minute mark you're on the edge of your seat waiting for the coach to give you the heads-up, but you have to try and stay relaxed and composed until you get the call. 'When you go on, the first thing to do is ensure the set-piece is stable and then try to get involved as much as possible, get your hands on the ball, make tackles, get around the pitch and make an impact. 'The bench has a massive role to play in the game now. It's not just about the XV, it's about the 23-man squad. 'France have world-class players on their bench who come on and make a massive difference for them. We have to make sure we do the same.' Vunipola will operate in the eye of the storm as the giant English and French packs slug it out over 80 minutes in search of the foothold that will propel their team to victory. Vunipola feels France players such as Romain Taofifenua (left) and Alexandre Flanquart will be a hard test. Vunipola says France's physicality will provide a  challenge for England as they look for Six Nations glory. Lock Courtney Lawes has described Les Bleus' forwards as 'big dudes' and Vunipola insists the Red Rose must be ready to fight fire with fire as they seek to end a sequence of three successive runners-up finishes in the Six Nations. 'We've seen the threat France pose with their pack and they have some big, heavy boys with an all-round game, but their set-piece is their bread and butter,' Vunipola said. 'As a pack we have to stand up to them first and foremost and then challenge them with our all-court game. 'I think they're the biggest pack we play against. Uini Atonio (tighthead prop, 6'4' and 25 stones) is a big boy and you don't want him running at you at full pace. 'They have some big boys, but we have some big boys ourselves so we have to stand up to them and match them in terms of physicality. 'These big forwards nowadays are massive but they can still get around the pitch.' Vunipola also referred to the threat posed by France's tighthead prop Uini Atonio ahead of the encounter. England start as pre-match favourites and are 4/5 to win the Championship, but Vunipola insists they must be pitch perfect if he is to celebrate winning the title alongside brother and team-mate Billy. 'Winning the Six Nations has been our target and to do it would be massive. We lost to Ireland but now have another chance to do it. We will have to perform at our best to beat France,' Vunipola said. 'Just to win the Six Nations is special. The added bonus would be that my brother will be there. It's added motivation for us to go out there and perform.'", "abstract": "England prop Mako Vunipola is anticipating a tense Six Nations finale when England play France on Saturday, knowing he could have a critical late role to play.

{"article": "Labour's strategy to cast Ed Miliband as an ordinary family man escalated tonight as his wife Justine gave her first major TV interview ahead of the general election. In a surprise move, she has spoken of her husband's regret at not seeing enough of their sons and the pressure of political attacks on their family life. The child actress-turned-barrister is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day, but it is likely to draw comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to bolster their poll ratings. Justine Miliband has spoken of her husband's regret at not seeing enough of their sons Daniel (right) and Sam (left) and the pressure of political attacks on their family life. At the weekend Mr Miliband spoke of the strains his political role puts on family life, claiming missing his wife and sons Daniel and Same is the 'hardest thing' about his job. Now Mrs Miliband has entered the fray in what will be seen as an attempt to humanise a politician often mocked for appearing wonkish. In a rare interview with  BBC News, she repeated the line that her husband's regret about the job of leading Labour is 'not seeing the children enough or worrying he doesn't see the children as much as he'd like'. Asked about dealing with the attacks on her husband she added: 'I think it's going to get worse, I think over the next couple of months it's going to get really vicious, really personal, but I'm totally up for this fight.' She stressed that she was going public now 'because I think this goes way beyond Ed as an individual, I think it's about whether decencies and principle count for something in political life'. Mrs Miliband admitted she had not yet started thinking about how her life will change if her husband becomes Prime Minister in two months' time. 'I haven't thought about the future particularly,' she said. 'Probably like most women, being a working mother and having a husband who's Ed, I'm definitely on a 48-hour timetable, so I haven't really thought about it.' Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day. Mrs Miliband said her husband showed he had 'guts' when he decided to take on Rupert Murdoch and News International over phone-hacking in 2011, though she admitted she was 'nervy' about it at the time. Asked if she ever advised Mr Miliband on policy, she said: 'We are married, so we talk about things that happen to crop up. 'One of the clearest examples that has stayed with me is when we were going to work one morning in the car and the radio came on with the news and the news had just broken about phone hacking and about how low some journalists had gone in pursuit of the news. Mrs Miliband said she was speaking out to show that she was'more than a dress', a reference to her appearances on stage at party conferences. 'We just were totally shocked - that immediate human reaction - and sickened actually. We talked about it and quite quickly, for someone like Ed, it becomes a question not just of that immediate reaction but. 'What am I going to do about this?' 'We talked briefly. It was back in 2011 and you didn't take on News International in 2011, so it felt pretty serious. I remember being on the Tube on the way home and I had a copy of the Evening Standard and my eyes caught the headline, which was something like 'Miliband calls on Murdoch to resign'. 'I remember thinking 'He has gone ahead and done that' and that felt pretty nervy and I remember not being quite sure how it would all play out, but I thought 'You have shown you have got the guts to do things that people wouldn't expect'.' A new opinion poll today suggested more voters think that their families and Britain as a whole will be better-off with David Cameron as prime minister than with Mr Miliband in charge. The YouGov poll for the Westminster Policy Institute found that 26 per cent of people believed Britain as a while would be better off with Mr Miliband as prime minister, compared to 39 per cent for Mr Cameron. When the same question was asked about their families' position, some 35 per cent thought they would be better off with Mr Cameron in charge, compared to 26 per cent for Mr Miliband. In the new focus on life at their family home in north London, Mrs Miliband lifted the lid on how their sons cope with seeing their father in the spotlight. 'There's quite a lot of chats about what the red team's doing and who the red team's helping,' she said. Mr Miliband repeatedly said he would not copy David Cameron's habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies. But Labour strategists plan to use his wife more in the run up to the election, in addition to appearances at party conferences.

The game marked five years to the day Fulham beat Juventus 4-1 in the Europa League, arguably the greatest night in the club\u2019s history. But defeat  left them only six points clear of relegation to League One. Sam Byram leaps highest to send Leeds United into the lead against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Byram beats his man as the Yorkshire side take the lead against Fulham in west London.

It was inexplicable that Fulham were not in front before Leeds took the lead, five minutes before the break.

On 48 minutes Leeds went two ahead, an Alex Mowatt corner bouncing all the way through Fulham\u2019s box to allow defender Bamba to head in at the back post. Then left-back Konstantinos Stafylidis was sent off for two yellow cards within 45 seconds of each other to end any hope of a comeback. Sol Bamba doubles the travelling side's lead as he heads past Marcus Bettinelli in the Fulham goal. Leeds United's Bamba celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game with teammate Billy Sharp. Symons said: \u2019It was ridiculous getting the second so soon after the first. He dived in right in front of the Leeds fans for the second. It seemed the ref was moving on, but someone was in his ear then he changed his mind and went for the second yellow. It was rash and petulant.\u2019 Fulham continued to dominate, despite having a man less, until the 88th minute when Antenucci scored with a first-time shot. Leeds manager Neil Redfearn said: \u2019Our lot got a bollocking at half time, I thought we were off the pace. We worked it out and toughed it out.

Baby's future: Schaefer's mother Kia Walker was pictured at the hospital on Wednesday, smoking and talking to Mack, and is allegedly pressuring the teen to let her take care of the newborn. Miss Mack and Schaefer have been accused of the premeditated murder of Miss Mack\u2019s socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack and if they are found guilty they will face many years behind bars - or even the death penalty by firing squad. What happened? Heather Mack and her murdered mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, pictured in an undated vacation photo. Mack is allowed to keep her newborn baby in prison for the first two years. In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter\u2019s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in Kerobokan prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers. \u2018The discussions have been pretty intense,\u2019 said a hospital source. \u2018There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.\u2019 It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack\u2019s relatives. 'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source. While Miss Mack recovers from the caesarian delivery in Bali\u2019s Sanglah Hospital on Wednesday, Mr Schaefer\u2019s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length. Ms Walker has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes. While she has not spoken publicly about her son\u2019s murder case - nor about the birth of his baby - she revealed on social media in October that a plea for donations to help pay for her son\u2019s legal fees had reached $10,600. She said she had been advised not to comment publicly on the murder case in which her son has been accused of battering Mrs Wiese-Mack to death and stuffing her body in a suitcase, with the help of his girlfriend Heather. Accused couple: Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer, from Chicago, Illinois, (pictured in court on March 12) are being tried for the murder of Mack's mother last August. \u2018I spent the weekend practicing self-care,\u2019 she wrote at the time, adding: \u2018I\u2019ve accomplished a great deal by staying home and being surrounded by my friends and chosen family.\u2019 But now she is in Bali - and at the bedside of Heather Mack while her son paces up and down his cell in Kerobokan prison, reportedly frustrated because he has been unable to set eyes on his baby daughter. The accused couple are scheduled to appear in court again next week but legal sources suggested the case might be adjourned to allow Miss Mack more time to recover from the birth.", "abstract": "Kia Walker, the grandmother of Heather Mack's newborn daughter, has flown to Bali to discuss the future of the baby girl who is set to spend the first two years of her life behind bars in Kerobokan Prison with her mother.

{"article": "If you don't possess Piers Morgan's interrogation skills, making someone laugh may encourage them to spill their secrets. Researchers claim that sharing a few chuckles makes people more willing to tell others something personal about themselves, without necessarily being aware that they are doing so. The act of verbally opening up to someone is a crucial building block that helps to form new relationships and intensify social bonds. Laughing with a stranger (illustrated with a stock image) makes us more likely to open up and tell others something\u00a0personal about ourselves, which encourages bonds of friendship, a new study claims. Such self-disclosure can be of a highly sensitive nature - like sharing one's religious convictions or personal fears - or a superficial scrap of information such as a favourite type of food. Alan Gray of University College London (UCL) set out to investigate the role and influence of laughter in this disclosure process. Together with his colleagues, he observed the behaviour of 112 students from Oxford University, who did not known each other and were divided into groups of four. They watched a 10-minute video together, without chatting to one another. The videos were designed to invoke different amounts of laughter as well as the amount of positive feelings or emotions they elicited. Participants watched different videos including a clip of comedian Michael MacIntyre (pictured) to encourage them to laugh. One, for example, featured a stand-up comedy routine by Michael McIntyre, while another was a golf instruction video and a third, an excerpt from a nature documentary. After the volunteers watched the chosen video, the levels of laughter and their emotional state was measured. Each group member also had to write a message to another participant to help them get to know each other better. The researchers found that participants who had a good laugh together shared significantly more intimate information than the groups who did not watch the comedy routine. Mr Gray suggests this is not merely because it is a positive experience, but because of the physiology behind laughter, which triggers the release of the so-called \u2018happy hormone\u2019 endorphin. The findings, published in Springer's journal Human Nature, support the idea that laughter encourages people to make more intimate disclosures to strangers. Scientists believe that the person who disclosed information, was seldom aware of what they had done, and it was only the listener who realised it had happened. \u2018This seems to be in line with the notion that laughter is linked specifically to fostering behaviors that encourage relationship development, since observer ratings of disclosure may be more important for relationship development than how much one feels one is disclosing,\u2019 Mr Gray said. \u2018These results suggest that laughter should be a serious topic for those interested in the development of social relationships.\u2019 A recent study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a long-term partner. Experts say that a sense of fun is more important to many people than whether someone has a degree or is religious. Research by the University of Zurich revealed that playfulness is important to both sexes \u2013 just behind friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour. Play to win hearts: A new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a partner (illustrated with a stock image) - just behind\u00a0friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour. They also found that naturally playful people deem humour, a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers. They described playful adults as those having a love of wordplay who enjoy teasing, people who are spontaneous and will take on a challenge lightheartedly and those who play the fool, for example. Reserachers asked asked 327 young adults from Germany, Switzerland and Austria to examine a list of 16 characteristics and indicate whether or not they found them desirable in a potential long-term partner. The results showed that men and women largely agreed in their orders of preference, although there were differences in individual ratings. For example, women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women. Friendliness, intelligence, humour and a fun tendency came at the top of the list. Playfulness ranked mid-table, although not all that far behind the favourites. \u2018Therefore, this personality trait also seems important for the choice of partner \u2013 at least more so that the partner having a degree, good genes or being religious,\u2019 said Dr Ren\u00e9 Proyer.", "abstract": "A new study has found that laughing with a stranger can encourage people to open up and share personal information about themselves, which can help to form new relationships and intensify social bonds.

{"article": "It could be football's greatest ever dynasty \u2013 Zinedine Zidane as Real Madrid's head coach and his four sons out on the pitch in the famous white shirts playing for him. It sounds far-fetched, but then so does the idea that Zidane could be Real's B-team coach and that his offspring would be at various levels of the club's youth system \u2013 which is already a reality. Sportsmail looks at the chances of things going to the next level. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Theo prove he's a chip off the old block. Zinedine Zidane is currently Real Madrid's B-team coach and could replace Carlo Ancelotti at the Bernabeu. Zidane enjoyed a glittering career as a player at Real and his sons are all currently at the academy. The coach. Zinedine Zidane has spent three days in Munich this week under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola and Real Madrid are hoping that what the teacher did for Barcelona the pupil will one day do for them. Club president Florentino Perez has decided he wants the former player to lead the side one day and Zidane is preparing for the possibility that it could come as soon as next season. He is one of seven French coaches spending this week at Bayern Munich's training facilities where along with former Real Madrid team-mate Claude Makelele he is seeing first hand how Guardiola works. Next season he could be in the same position Guardiola was in 2008 \u2013 having graduated from his club's youth system to take charge of the first team. He will cut the same sharp-suited imposing figure on the touchline and he will command the same respect among rivals, players and media, but will he be as prolifically successful? Zidane visited Bayern's training ground with Bernard Diomede (left) and Claude Makelele (right) this week. Real hope Zidane can emulate Pep Guardiola's transition from a player to boss with Barcelona and Bayern. Zidane currently coaches Real Madrid's second team, Castilla, in one of Spain's four regional third-tier divisions. If Castilla win their division they will go into a play-off for a place in the second division next season. But by then Carlo Ancelotti may have moved on and Zidane may have stepped up to replace him. There is no question a career as a coach is what the former Ballon d'Or and World Cup winner wants. As well as this week's masterclass with Guardiola he has also been to Marseille to watch Marcelo Bielsa work. He wants to coach the France team one day and if their 2016 campaign on home soil were to end in tears there would be calls for him to take charge of the national side he once lead to the biggest prize in football. The Madrid job will probably come before the national team however. Those who have seen him at close quarters on the training pitch say he's inspirational and has none of that haughtiness that sometimes prevents great players from being able to improve lesser mortals. Zidane lead France to World Cup glory in 1998 and is touted as a future national team coach. With Zidane in charge, Real Madrid's Castilla team are in one of Spain's four regional third-tier divisions. Zidane fights for the ball with Manchester United's Roy Keane during a Champions League tie in 2003. He's tough and media-savvy after years of coping with the intense spotlight shone on him in France where he is adored far more than Michel Platini \u2013 his rival as the country's greatest ever player, but one who never won the World Cup. Ultimately expecting him to emulate Guardiola might be asking too much \u2013 the Bayern Munich coach's tactical brain and obsessive character make him unique. He also has the baggage of having been so good as a player. Diego Maradona and Pele never made it as managers, but Alfredo di Stefano and Johan Cruyff did, so there are precedents. Johan Cruyff was a fine player and also excelled as a manager at Barcelona. And the sons\u2026. Enzo. Star of Real Madrid C, Enzo, wears the Fernandez name on his back, the family name of the Zidane boys' mother Veronique Fernandez \u2013 a dancer who he met in 1988 playing for Cannes. It perhaps weighs less heavily on the shoulders of the young prodigies. Already a Spain Under 19 international Enzo, just like his siblings, has the choice of three countries. Playing for France would please his father; and so might playing for Algeria, which is his third possibility because of his grandfather. He is the player who most resembles his father in playing style. He plays as a No 10 and is one rung on the ladder below  Castilla. Enzo Zidane Fernandez is the star of Real Madrid C and is already a Spain Under 19 international. Enzo's style as a gifted No 10 with Real's lower ranks most resembles that of his father. Luca.

{"article": "Cabinet Office Minister Rob Wilson claimed\u00a0he received \u2018darkly veiled threats\u2019 to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son. A Tory Minister is embroiled in an explosive row with Britain\u2019s top policewoman amid claims she \u2018threatened\u2019 him over a child sex abuse case. Cabinet Office Minister Rob Wilson said Sara Thornton, the chief constable of Thames Valley Police, tried to stop him raising allegations of police errors in a \u2018sickening\u2019 paedophile scandal. Wilson claimed he received \u2018darkly veiled threats\u2019 to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son. And he said one of the \u2018threats\u2019 was made by Ms Thornton. But Ms Thornton, said to be David Cameron\u2019s favourite police leader, hit back angrily last night. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday she rejected the allegations as \u2018unfounded\u2019. \u2018I categorically deny ever making any sort of threat \u2013veiled or otherwise \u2013 to Rob Wilson MP.\u2019 And she said the claims entitled her to sue him for libel. The clash involves a woman who worked as a carer for two disabled children. She did not know their father, David Cullen, was on the Sex Offenders\u2019 Register. He was supposed to be monitored by Thames Valley Police. But the woman claims police blundered by failing to alert her to his paedophile record. Cullen was subsequently jailed for life after abusing her young son 25 times in six months. Mr Wilson, who is the woman\u2019s local MP in Reading, offered to raise her case in the Commons in 2008. But he says police tried to stop him. \u2018There were all sorts of darkly veiled threats if I went head-to-head and toe-to-toe with Thames Valley Police,\u2019 he said. \u2018I had phone calls from at least two members of the force who rang me up directly about this and tried to stop me raising it in Parliament, even though it was quite clearly the right thing to do. \u2018They said things like \u201cReally, Mr Wilson? So early on in your Parliamentary career? Do you want to make an error about getting involved in raising this issue? There may be more to this than meets the eye. You could be getting into a very difficult situation.\u201d \u2019 The Mail on Sunday has confirmed that Mr Wilson claims Ms Thornton was one of those who tried to deter him. He said he had raised the case not to attack the police but to highlight concerns about how his constituent \u2013 who cannot be named as she has a legal right to anonymity \u2013 had been dealt with. He said: \u2018I wonder whether there is something systemic within the police, that, where difficult personal cases are involved, they don\u2019t want to get involved.\u2019 But Ms Thornton, who is next month set to become the boss of the new National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said: \u2018Such allegations are unfounded and libellous. I will be writing to Mr Wilson directly to seek clarification on exactly what he has alleged. \u2018I am extremely concerned that such serious allegations, relating to alleged events over six years ago, now appear to have been made via the media and not with the force directly via any formal complaint, either at the time of the case in 2006 or at any point since.\u2019 But defiant Mr Wilson last night stood by his claims. He criticised Ms Thornton for threatening to sue him and claimed she was continuing to try to stop the matter being discussed openly. He told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018I absolutely stand by my comments. The purpose was to draw attention to the fact that mistakes had been made by Thames Valley Police in the past. 'Unfounded': Thames Valley chief constable Sara Thornton has categorically denied making any threats. \u2018It is very disappointing that Sara Thornton is making legal threats which will prevent proper open discussion. From the very beginning I have sought transparency and openness and it is a shame that the police are still seeking to close down a reasonable and honest debate. \u2018My intention is to ensure that should similar cases arise in the future, they are dealt with properly.\u2019 Mr Wilson previously led criticism of the BBC for failing to report the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Last year he was promoted to the Cabinet Office where he is responsible for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War. His differences with Ms Thornton follow criticism of Thames Valley Police over the way it handled the Oxfordshire child sex scandal in which as many as 373 children could have been targeted for sex by gangs of men over the last 16 years. Earlier this month, Ms Thornton repeated an apology to victims and their families after an official review found the force had made mistakes. Mr Wilson said he referred obliquely to the conduct of police when he defied the alleged \u2019", "abstract": "Cabinet Office Minister Rob Wilson has claimed that he received \"darkly veiled threats\" from Sara Thornton, the chief constable of Thames Valley Police, over a child sex abuse case.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic's harsh dismissal did not prove to be costly as his team-mates beat the odds to score two crucial away goals at Stamford Bridge. Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to heap praise on the Ligue 1 outfit who, including extra time, played for 89 minutes with a numerical disadvantage. Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for a lunging tackle on Chelsea's Oscar. 'That is one of the best performances I've ever seen with 10 men from PSG,' said Rooney.

{"article": "Jeremy Vine has been funnelling cash through a limited company, Jelly Vine Productions, of which his daughter, Martha, is a shareholder (both pictured) In a tongue-in-cheek guide to \u2018tax accounting for the rich\u2019, Jeremy Vine once advised the wealthy to find a \u2018tax magician with the power to bend the rules, befuddle the tax inspector and make money invisible\u2019. Now it seems that the BBC Radio 2 star has taken his own advice to heart. Mr Vine appears to have been using his ten-year-old daughter Martha to avoid tax payments. The presenter of the Jeremy Vine Show and the TV quiz Eggheads, has been funnelling cash through a limited company, Jelly Vine Productions, of which she is a shareholder. The controversial move will highlight the BBC\u2019s practice of paying some presenters off its books using money from the millions of pounds it earns in licence fee-payers\u2019 money. In 2012, it emerged that more than 140 BBC stars were funnelling cash through private firms to avoid paying millions in tax. During the resulting furore, Mr Vine ran a spoof, \u2018Jeremy\u2019s six-step guide to tax avoidance for the rich\u2019, on his radio show. Jelly Vine Productions had almost \u00a3810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 \u2013 the last accounts available, and \u00a31million in 2012. If the funds had been paid to Mr Vine through the Pay As You Earn scheme used by most firms, it would have been taxed at 40 or 45 per cent. But by channelling them through a private firm, he can declare them as company profits, subject to corporation tax of 23 or 24 per cent. It is not clear whether these were earnings for Mr Vine\u2019s BBC work or included other fees such as payments for speeches or book royalties. But by arranging his finances in this way, he ensured Jelly Vine Productions could pay dividends to its shareholders. The firm is controlled by Mr Vine, who has 51 per cent of the shares. His wife, Rachel, has 30 per cent and the remaining 19 per cent is owned by Martha, one of their two daughters. Richard Murphy, an accountant at Tax Research, said: \u2018He is obviously using the company to reduce his tax bill. It is perfectly legal, and perfectly allowed. Jelly Vine Productions had almost \u00a3810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 \u2013 the last accounts available. 'What is a little unusual is his daughter. Let\u2019s be honest, she is unlikely to have said, \u201cDaddy, I want to spend my pocket money on shares in the company\u201d.\u2019 Jelly Vine Productions\u2019 accounts do not disclose how much it has paid out or whether it has paid dividends to all three family members, or just Mr Vine himself. Mr Murphy said Mr Vine could have named his daughter as a shareholder for \u2018long-term tax-planning\u2019 purposes, reducing the tax she would pay if she inherits part of the business. Alternatively, Mr Vine may have made his wife and daughter shareholders to split the dividend payouts, keeping them just small enough to ensure they are taxed at a lower rate, rather than at 40 or 45 per cent. A spokesman for the presenter said the reason for making his daughter a shareholder was \u2018private\u2019 but \u2018perfectly legal\u2019, adding: \u2018I don\u2019t think it is cynical. What Jeremy is doing is very common. If the Government makes laws that allow people to do things that are advantageous, it is up to the Government to change the laws.\u2019 BBC contracts stipulate that presenters must pay the taxes they owe, and tells HMRC who it has paid each year.

One way to avoid crowds on the slopes, is to hire out the whole resort exclusively - something one Utah ski village offers for $10,000. Eagle Point, in Utah, can host 200 people at its resort and while its slopes are open to the public from Thursday to Sunday, from Monday to Wednesday, skiers will have the lifts and the runs to themselves. Eagle Point in Utah can be hired out completely for almost $10,000 (\u00a36,500) and can cater for 200 people. And while it sounds like the sort of thing that would only be exclusively accessed by the rich, royal or uber-famous, it's not. In theory, the whole place including accommodation and slopes with five lifts to access 600 acres of skiable powder, can be all yours for $50 (\u00a332.50). Owner Shane Gadbaw, a former banker, rents out the whole resort privately for $10,000 (\u00a36,486), which if split between 200 people works out at just $50 (\u00a332.50) each. And because it's called the 'As You Wish Package', and the resort is run privately and not by some big, faceless corporation, it's all tailored to your group's needs. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Gadbaw says that three key virtues of an authentic ski and snowboard experience, affordable first class food service and a terrain for all levels make the resort what it is. The US resort offers stunning views out over Utah, while this luxury continues to the facilities and food on offer. Executive chef Jimmie McDowell ensures his food and his staff are of the highest standard for all the guests. 'Eagle Point resembles a ski resort of the classic era before high speed detachable lifts, luxury shopping villages and amusement park-like crowds and lines. Guests have the space to enjoy the snow and the mountains without fighting crowds. As a private, family-run operation, the culture of Eagle Point and its staff is set from the top. Our goal is simple: we want you to have an amazing time at our resort. You will find the friendliest and most helpful staff in the resort industry. 'From the personal escort to your condo at check-in, to the special attention to your kids in our ski school program, you will be treated like a special guest at our resort.' Most of the lodging is ski-in/ski-out and located within a short walk through the fresh powder from the main lodge. What better thing can there be after a testing day on the slopes than relaxing in the bar with friends and an alcoholic beverage? The resort caters for all levels of skier, and has the facilities to provide for all the family. 'Eagle Point is offering the opportunity to reserve the entire resort on an exclusive basis,' says the resort\u00a0website. 'Imagine you and your friends, family, social or corporate group, enjoying exclusive access to 600 skiable acres, five lifts, the terrain park - and of course no lift lines! 'Stay in comfortable accommodations, with superb dining options and plenty of apres ski fun for everyone - all tailored to your group's priorities and interests. 'This is your chance to be king of the mountain.' The resort can be booked privately from Monday through until Wednesday, and could cost you just \u00a335. Clearly the package is most attractive to corporate groups and its convenient position 241 miles or a less than four-hour drive from Las Vegas doesn't hurt at all. By comparison, the much more famous Vail in Colorado is a three hours and 15 minute flight away. The Canyonside Lodges which includes The Outpost Grill restaurant dishing up American cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a bar, two fireplaces, and five televisions. The Lodge is also the hub at night-time with live music and dancing guaranteed on Saturdays with a host of acts coming over from Vegas. The accommodation is a step back in time to what we'd consider a classic ski resort, with a village feel and an array of suites, condos, cottages and holiday homes, along with lodgings in Beaver City, a Mormon-settled town of about 2,500 people. The heavy snowfall has mean Eagle Point has maintained a steady influx of customers to its slopes. The region boasts 40 feet of snow annually, and famously fun powder at that. Although this year hasn't been a good one for Eagle Point, it's turned around in the past week. After a brief closure in February it was planned that from February 21 the slopes would only be open on weekends due to a lack of snow fall and warm weather. However Mother Nature delivered and from yesterday regular service as resumed, albeit with a very generous free skiing for all on Sundays, as long as you sign up to the mailing list. The resort will cater for skiers as well as snowboarders and can provide all the equipment to make", "abstract": "Eagle Point, a ski resort in Utah, is offering skiers the chance to hire out the whole resort exclusively for $10,000.

{"article": "Disgraced Rolf Harris, 84 (pictured with his CBE), has seen his honour annulled at the order of the Queen following his conviction for historic sex abuse. Rolf Harris has finally been stripped of the CBE that was awarded to him by the Queen. The move came eight months after the disgraced former children\u2019s entertainer was jailed for nearly six years for a string of attacks on girls as young as seven. The paedophile, 84, had his honour annulled at the order of the Queen, days after being stripped of his Australian honours. Officials at the Cabinet Office had been accused of dragging their feet over the issue, but sources insisted they had to follow established procedures before removing the gong. An announcement in the London Gazette yesterday stated: \u2018The Queen has directed that the appointment of Rolf Harris to be a Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated 17 June 2006, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order.\u2019 Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who in January raised concerns in the Daily Mail about why Harris still had a CBE, welcomed the news. He said: \u2018I am delighted to hear that Rolf Harris has been stripped of his CBE. It is simply unacceptable convicted sex offenders like Rolf Harris should be allowed to make a mockery of our honours system.\u2019 When Harris, who was jailed in July last year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986, was stripped of his Australian honours last week, there was widespread disbelief that he still held his coveted CBE in Britain. It was awarded to him for services to entertainment and the arts, a year after he painted the Queen\u2019s 80th birthday portrait. Scroll down for video. Normal protocol sees honours forfeited where the person is considered to have brought the system into disrepute. A recommendation can be made by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a criminal offence, and the final decision must be approved by the Queen. Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006. During sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: 'Your reputation lies in ruins. You have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself.' Seven of the 12 counts related to the friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, including one incident when she was 15-years-old when he sexually assaulted her while Bindi slept in the adjacent bed. During his trial,\u00a0Harris was revealed as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character who had a dark side to his personality and used his fame to'mesmerise' underage fans before abusing them with impunity. Scotland Yard said he 'committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law.' The entertainer's conviction caused widespread revulsion in Australia and Britain, where his television programs were watched by millions of children. The decision by the Honours Forfeiture Committee, published in the London Gazette today (pictured), would have been approved by Prime Minister David Cameron and the Queen before being officially published. All public traces of the entertainer have since been removed from his home town of Bassendean in Western Australia following his convictions, while a plaque outside his childhood home has been demolished. His artworks have also been removed from the council chambers, and his status as a freeman of the city has been revoked. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, was among those who campaigned for the removal of the CBE. He has previously said: 'I find it difficult to understand why it has taken this committee so long. 'A number of paedophiles, of which Rolf Harris is one, have held significant honours, including Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith. They used their power and cloak of respectability to abuse children.' Last week, Mr Danczuk wrote to Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude asking him for an update on plans to strip Harris of his CBE. He added: 'They have come close to bringing the whole honours system into disrepute, and you would have their honours would have been removed more quickly. 'The Australians acted more quickly against Rolf Harris than we did.' Harris, whose fortune is estimated at \u00a311 million was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser. The former children's entertainer joins the likes of dictators Robert Mugabe and Nicolae Ceausescu and disgraced ex- banker Fred 'the Shred' Goodwin in being stripped of their titles. In January 2012, Mr Gooodwin had his", "abstract": "Rolf Harris, the disgraced former children's entertainer, has had his CBE annulled by the Queen following his conviction for historic sex abuse.

But before we get too down about things, there is still one Englishman standing in Europe this season. Manchester City may have crashed out to Barcelona but their on-loan defender Micah Richards is still eyeing European glory with Italian side Fiorentina. Manchester City defender Micah Richards is currently on loan at Serie A side Fiorentina. The 26-year-old helped Fiorentina to knock out Tottenham during the Europa League round of 32. Richards is the only remaining English player in the squads of the 16 teams remaining in the Champions League and the Europa League. His team produced a stunning performance to beat Serie A rivals Roma 3-0 in the Stadio Olimpico and complete a 4-1 aggregate triumph. Although Richards was not involved, he has featured in the Europa League this season and helped them knock out another Premier League club, Tottenham, in the round of 32. Richards, 26, had fallen out of favour under Manuel Pellegrini at City, making just 18 appearances in two seasons and decided to seek greater first-team opportunities in Florence. And while he has not been a mainstay of Vincenzo Montella's team, he has made 15 appearances across all competitions, almost certainly more than he would have made at City. Richards began to find first-team opportunities limited playing for Manchester City and was sent on loan. England international Richards has admitted he is uncertain where he will be playing his football next season. Richards could feature in the latter stages of the competition as La Viola bid to win their second European trophy in Warsaw on May 27. He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan at the end of the season, who are managed by his former City boss Roberto Mancini. But Richards told talkSPORT on Wednesday: 'It's difficult to say [where I will play] at the moment. Every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me, I'm still only 26 and I just want to play every game, that's what's important.' For now, however, Richards is flying the flag solo for England in European competition.

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed on Monday night that the young Tottenham star will definitely be unleashed from the start in tonight\u2019s friendly in Turin. Phil Jones is expected to operate in midfield as Hodgson tinkers with a team who have won seven out of seven this season, and Theo Walcott could return to the starting line-up. England captain Wayne Rooney has warned Harry Kane not let his full international debut be ruined by Italy. Kane celebrates after scoring his first international goal during England's 4-0 victory over Lithuania on Friday. All eyes will be on Kane, however, and Hodgson spoke of the \u2018magic touch\u2019 which has helped him score 30 goals this season, including his first for his country \u2014 within 79 seconds of his debut from the bench against Lithuania on Friday. But England captain Rooney, who is set to win his 103rd cap playing at the forward tip of a midfield diamond, warned Kane what he should expect from the likes of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci. Rooney said: \u2018With Italian defenders, they\u2019re clever defenders. They do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that, and not be frustrated. \u2018They\u2019re a passionate country who love their football and they\u2019re probably the closest in Europe to South American\u00a0teams. They\u2019ll do anything to stop you. They\u2019re tough to play against, organised, make it as difficult to play against as possible. They\u2019re the best in Europe at doing that. \u2018Harry\u2019s taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal. \u2018That\u2019s all he has to do,\u2019 insisted Rooney, who hopes to match Tommy Lawton\u2019s record of scoring in six successive England games, set in 1938-39. \u2018I\u2019m sure if he does that the way he has, he\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 Rooney insists Italy's defenders will do anything to stop the opposition and Kane must be aware. Kane will come up against Leonardo Bonucci (pictured) and Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday night. When Italy beat England at the World Cup in Brazil, no-one thought Kane anywhere near an international breakthrough - but he has made incredible progress. Hodgson said: \u2018It\u2019s great to see people like Harry Kane come on the scene and it\u2019s a fairytale for him at the moment. He\u2019s got the magic touch. Within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut. It doesn\u2019t get much better. This will be a tougher test, but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it. \u2018Our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for Lithuania, but we lost Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck, which has changed my thinking. \u2018We still have what I consider to be a very offensive line-up.

{"article": "This is the moment one of Australia's deadliest creatures found itself at the mercy of yet another of the nation's venomous killers. A Victorian farmer was astonished to find an enormous red-back spider had lifted an eastern brown snake off the ground and 'hurled it' into its web under one of the family's car at the weekend. 'It's just mindboggling,' said\u00a0Neale Postlethwaite, a farmer of 20 years from Gooroc, north of Melbourne. 'I can't believe it was actually able to stop it and then hurl it up backwards into its nest.' A Victorian farmer found this astonishing scene at the weekend, where a large red-back spider had managed to lift this baby eastern brown snake off the ground with its web and draw it up into its nest. Suspended above the ground, this eastern brown snake was caught in the spider web of a large red-back spider and lifted upwards. The snake was found dead overnight. Mr Postlethwaite found the baby snake suspended off the ground on Saturday evening, the large spider sitting on top. To his surprise, the snake was still alive at the time, with the farmer daring to place his finger nearby. 'I thought the snake was dead and went to put my finger there and the snake was still alive at the time,' Mr Postlethwaite said. The eastern brown snake is known for its potent venom, which can cause sudden death, neurotoxity, coagulation disturbances and nephrotoxicity, according to researchers. Mr Postlethwaite filmed video of the snake lolling around in its final hours. Eastern brown snakes - such as the one pictures - contain enough venom to kill 20 adults with a single bite. Australia is home to 20 out of the world's 25 most venomous snakes, including the eastern brown, which is found along the populous east coast. Redback spiders are found throughout the country and there more than 250 red-back bites each year which require the use of anti-venom, according to the Australian Museum. But this baby snake was presumably a victim of the spider's poison. The snake died overnight, with Mr Postlethwaite finding its corpse being devoured by ants in the dust the next day. Mr Postlethwaite told Daily Mail Australia his family often found redbacks on their property. This particular creature had been living under his wife's car. She is a little reticent about getting back behind the wheel, the farmer said. 'My wife doesn't want to drive her car until she can get an underbody car wash,' he joked.", "abstract": "A farmer in Victoria, Australia, witnessed a red-back spider lift an eastern brown snake off the ground and throw it into its web under one of the family's cars.

Taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent, research has shown. The cholesterol-lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly, which can trigger type 2 diabetes. The risk, which is far higher than previously believed, has prompted fresh concern about the side effects of the pills. The findings are particularly worrying as last year the NHS recommended that up to 17million adults should be on statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes. The drugs\u2019 rationing body NICE published guidance last July urging GPs to prescribe them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease in a decade. This represents around 40 per cent of adults in the UK, and academics said the advice was \u2018foolhardy\u2019 when so little was known about the side effects. In the latest study, scientists from the University of Eastern Finland studied 8,749 men aged 45 to 73 over a six-year period. Just under a quarter were taking statins when the study started. Some had only been on the pills for a few months, others for several years. Over the course of the study, the scientists found that taking statins increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 46 per cent. Their research, published in the journal Diabetologia, found that statins reduced the ability of insulin to break down blood sugar. This is known as insulin sensitivity, and was on average 24.3 per cent lower in men who were taking statins. The cholesterol-lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly, which can trigger type 2 diabetes. The researchers believe that if insulin does not break down blood sugar, and the body\u2019s sugar levels rise too high, then it can trigger type 2 diabetes. They concluded: \u2018Statin therapy was associated with a 46 per cent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 'The association of statin use with increased risk of developing diabetes is most likely directly related to statins decreasing both insulin sensitivity and secretion.\u2019 Dr Aseem Malhotra, a consultant cardiologist in London, said that contrary to the NHS guidance, healthy adults should not be taking statins, adding: \u2018I personally wouldn\u2019t take it or recommend it to friend or family member who is otherwise healthy but let them make up their own minds after giving them all the information. \u2018Eating a handful of nuts or four tablespoons of olive oil may be a more effective way at reducing risk of a heart attack, stroke or death and without the side effects.\u2019 Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said healthy patients prescribed statins to prevent heart disease should take the \u2018lowest possible dose\u2019. He went on to warn that people with existing heart conditions should not stop taking the pills, saying: \u2018It is important that people taking statins because of existing cardiovascular disease should continue to take them as the benefits will outweigh the risks.\u2019", "abstract": "Taking statins can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 46%, according to research from the University of Eastern Finland.

Cook made no attempt to hide the hurt he has felt back home on his Buckinghamshire farm while England floundered so badly under his replacement Eoin Morgan that they could not even make the last eight. 'I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to a tournament,' said Cook of his sacking on the brink of the World Cup. 'I don't know what's gone on over there, and I can only speak from watching a little bit from afar, but it did look like the lads were shell-shocked from the first two games. That's when you need real leadership to steer you through that. 'I can't speak about what's gone on in depth but you always back yourself and I would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken from me. The selectors made that decision because they thought it was best for English cricket. Hindsight has probably proved them wrong but now it's easy to say that. 'Whether I would have made a difference I don't know, but I was confident we would get out of the group. From there you just have to win three games in a row \u2014 that's how this World Cup has worked.' Ouch. What a mess England find themselves in. They made decent progress in Test cricket last summer but that has been virtually invalidated by the crushing inadequacy of the World Cup squad \u2014 and Cook knows it. Cook believes hindsight has proved the ECB wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament. 'The Test team was in a good place,' said Cook. 'I wouldn't say all the confidence has gone but a hell of a lot of it has. It's a different format but all teams are grouped under the same English umbrella and we can't be naive enough to think that they're not. 'We have a repair job to do and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and starting to win. We built that momentum a little bit after the Ashes 14 or 15 months ago with a younger side, including the likes of Joe Root and Gary Ballance. 'There was a feelgood factor about the English game in the middle of August after the Tests. Since then it's been tough going. We've got to rebuild again.' Cook (right) feels England have to rebuild the feelgood factor that followed Test success against India. Cook (left) will lead England in three Tests in the West Indies in April, before New Zealand visit in May. Cook feels the ECB have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament. Eoin Morgan's England captaincy came under particular scrutiny during the poor World Cup performance. Cook did not mention Morgan by name but there is little doubt that he proved a desperate disappointment as England's one-day replacement captain. Not only was he unable to regain the form that has largely deserted him over the past year but Morgan was not the adventurous tactician many imagined him to be. The Irishman also spoke such gibberish in public that he ended up saying he had 'no regrets' over the worst World Cup in England's history. Whether he retains the one-day leadership remains to be seen but he has done himself few favours by insisting he will miss England's", "abstract": "Former England Test captain Alastair Cook has criticised the management who sacked him before the World Cup, stating that the decision was made too close to the tournament. Cook believes that the decision was wrong and that the team needed real leadership to steer them through the first two games. Cook's comments will concern under-pressure coach Peter Moores, who must now wonder if his relationship with his Test captain is seriously damaged."}

Now Mason has been ordered to pay back \u00a317,884 over six months after he was convicted of fraud charges relating to 85 tickets used over a period of 21 months. At a proceeds of crime hearing Mason, a contract worker, was told failure to pay will result in a default sentence of 12 months in prison. Detective Constable David Williams, a financial investigator said: 'This sentence sends a clear message to anyone thinking of trying to evade payment of train fares and parking that it really isn't worth it.' A search of the fraudster's home revealed a sophisticated  set-up to make the fake train travel and parking tickets, including a software package which allowed him to design the counterfeit tickets (pictured) After raiding Mason's home, police found fake and genuine tickets, glossy photographic paper,  printers, as well as craft knives, scissors and a cutting board, which were all used in the ticket-making process. Mason, of Hatfield, Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for two years. He has also been ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and a 12-day restorative justice course at Sheffield Crown Court. The British Transport Police investigation began in autumn 2013 when East Coast Trains station support staff saw Mason's black Vauxhall Meriva car on several occasions in the Executive Car Park at Doncaster train station. Various ticket discrepancies were noted including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid. Replicating the real tickets, Mason used  software to change the details on the ticket in order to get free travel. He included the type of ticket, the date, the price, the journey and the printing date (pictured) But inspectors noticed various ticket discrepancies, including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid. Mason used the software to forge the back of the train ticket in meticulous detail (pictured). He has been ordered to pay back \u00a317,884 over six months after he was convicted of fraud charges. BTP was informed and in December an officer spotted the car and approached Mason when he returned to his vehicle later that day. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud offences and a search of the car revealed 10 further tickets believed to have been forged. Forensic examination of the computer devices found at his home revealed Mason had used the computers to produce forged travel and parking tickets. The offences were committed between March 24, 2011, and December 19, 2013. At a proceeds of crime hearing Mason, a contract worker, was told failure to pay will result in a default sentence of 12 months in prison.

Goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez gave Barcelona a 2-1 win to move four points ahead of Madrid atop La Liga with 10 games remaining but it was only Ronaldo who got his name on the scoresheet, after a quieter display by Messi's imperious standards. Messi appeared relaxed in the tunnel, dabbling in conversation with his Barcelona team-mates, his fleece zipped up to his chin. Ronaldo stood poised, staring forward. The Nou Camp was an inferno, shrouded in gold, purple and blue with the 99,000 supporters in fearsome voice as the two superpowers of global football marched out on the pitch. Cristiano Ronaldo got on the scoresheet but it was Lionel Messi who was happiest after El Clasico. Messi (left) provided the assist for Barcelona's first goal in El Clasico from Jeremy Mathieu.

Cristiano Ronaldo (left) poked Real Madrid level after 31 minutes, completing a tremendous move. Ronaldo (second left) watches on as he brings Madrid level against arch rivals Barcelona. Ronaldo's first touch of the ball after 40 seconds was met with searing jeers by the Barcelona fans. He was eventually crowded out by Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic and the dispossession of Madrid's talisman was met with emphatic cheers. Messi's start was subdued, the diminutive Argentina international lingering quietly in the centre of the pitch, exchanging the occasional pass with Andres Iniesta in the first five minutes. But he snapped into life in the sixth minute with a nutmeg on Madrid playmaker Toni Kroos. Six minutes later, the first clear chance of the game fell to Ronaldo, who escaped his defender on the back post but could only turn Karim Benzema's deft lob onto the crossbar with Claudio Bravo beaten. He should have scored and Barcelona were off the hook. Messi was still awaiting his first opportunity to get at Madrid's defence. Nutmeg aside, his first 15 was perhaps best summed up by Iniesta uncharacteristically hitting a looping pass over his team-mate, who had found space out on the right touchline. But two minutes later, Messi had the ball at his feet and he surged inside, picked out Neymar and burst into the area, where he met the cross with his head but sent it wide. Barcelona's breakthrough came on 19, and Messi had the assist. Suarez was fouled  on the left, Messi whipped a glorious ball into the area and Mathieu flicked it past Iker Casillas to give Luis Enrique's side the lead. It was Messi's 15th assist of the season and Ronaldo's miss after 12 minutes already appeared costly. The goal galvanised Barcelona and Suarez drew a foul from Pepe two minutes after the opener and Messi seized the ball again. This time he was central and 25 yards out but his effort was deflected out for a corner which came to nothing. Neymar missed a glorious chance for 2-0 on the half hour mark, meeting a ball across goal from Suarez six yards out, only to guide his effort safely into the hands of Casillas with the goal gaping.

Ronaldo hit the crossbar from close range with the scores goalless at the Nou Camp. It was a shocking miss and 30 seconds later, Madrid were level. Ronaldo led the surge forward and as Benzema collected possession on the right of the penalty area, the Portugal international continued his run through the centre. Benzema sensed his presence and picked out his run with a glorious swish of his heel. Ronaldo hit fifth gear to beat Bravo to the ball, poking it under the goalkeeper to haul Madrid level as the jeers spewed out at the Nou Camp. Eight minutes before half time, Ronaldo picked up the ball on the left and skipped past Alves but with Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique closing him down, Ronaldo went tumbling. Television replays showed that Pique momentarily left his boot dangling, perhaps to entice a Ronaldo fall but the referee's decision to book the Madrid man was correct. In the 40th minute, Ronaldo thought he had assisted a goal from Gareth Bale, who poked Ronaldo's header into the back of the net. Bale was definitely onside but Ronaldo was not and the goal was rightly ruled out. But the Madrid man was finishing the first half in scintillating form.

{"article": "(CNN)As an offensive guard for the Baltimore Ravens, John Urschel already has a lot on his plate. He regularly goes head to head with the top defensive players in the NFL and does his best to keep quarterback Joe Flacco out of harm's way. But besides his endeavors on the field, Urschel also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with NFL players: mathematical research. Not content with the respect of the locker room, he also seeks the esteem of top mathematicians around the globe. \"I have a Bachelor's and Master's in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals,\" Urschel wrote in a recent article for The Players' Tribune. His latest contribution to the mathematical realm was a paper for the Journal of Computational Mathematics with the impressively esoteric title, \"A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians.\" Urschel, 23, makes no effort to hide his unusual combination of talents: his official Twitter handle is @MathMeetsFball. As word of his double life spread on social media in recent days, users responded with fascination and admiration. \"You are my goddamn hero (football fan and aspiring complex/functional analyst here),\" tweeted Roy Cardenas, who describes himself as a math Ph.D. student. But Urschel acknowledges that he has faced questions from NFL officials, journalists, fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has \"a bright career ahead of me in mathematics.\" After every season, he says in the Players' Tribune article, his mother tries to discourage him from continuing to play football. The Penn State graduate says the reason he keeps going isn't for the money (he drives a used Nissan Versa and lives on less than $25,000 a year) or \"for some social status associated with being an elite athlete.\" It's simpler than that. \"I play because I love the game. I love hitting people,\" he writes. \"There's a rush you get when you go out on the field, lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you.\" \"This is a feeling I'm (for lack of a better word) addicted to, and I'm hard-pressed to find anywhere else,\" he explains. He shared his thoughts after San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced last week that he was retiring from professional football at age 24 because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. Urschel says he envies Borland but doesn't feel able to quit. \"When I go too long without physical contact I'm not a pleasant person to be around,\" he writes. \"This is why, every offseason, I train in kickboxing and wrestling in addition to my lifting, running and position-specific drill work.\" And as if two areas of overachievement weren't enough, there is one other thing at which Urschel excels. \"I'm also an avid chess player,\" he says. \"And I have aspirations of eventually being a titled player one day.\"", "abstract": "John Urschel, an offensive guard for the Baltimore Ravens, is also a mathematician with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals.

Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive \u2013 and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool. Scroll down for video. A new US study may make you think twice about biting a piece of lettuce.Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive \u2013 and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. 'It was no surprise that plants responded differently to having their leaves chewed by a caterpillar or sucked by an aphid,' Heidi Appel, senior research scientist University of Missouri told the Washington Post. 'What surprised us was how different plant responses were to each of the caterpillars and aphids. The plants could clearly tell insects apart - they really seem to \"know\" who's attacking.' Professor Appel exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms. She predicted that as the insects eat the plant, Arabidopsis could tell by the chewing motion and the drool whether the creature was a butterfly or a worm. Heidi Appel (left) and Rex Cocroft (right) previously conducted a study that\u00a0found plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment. She also believed that the plant could tell several different insects apart, even when they were eating the leaves simultaneously. To test her theory, she harvested the chewed up Arabidopsis, extracted the genes, and froze it in a laboratory. Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes. Researchers in Bonn, Germany, found plants give off a gas when under 'attack'. Super-sensitive microphones picked up a 'bubbling' sound from a healthy plant. But this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat. Even a tiny insect bite could have an effect. 'The more a plant is subjected to stress, the louder the signal,' said Dr Frank K\u00fchnemann. Plants do not actually scream in pain. But different sounds are heard when the gas they emit, ethylene, is bombarded with lasers. The research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer, as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound. It could then be separated from the fresher ones. Based on the gene analysis, Professor Appel found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly. There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it. Professor Appel hopes that this will allow scientists to breed plants that are naturally insect resistant rather than spraying them with pesticides. The research builds on a study last year that found plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment. In this study, caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis. Using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant, scientists measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar. Professor Appel then played back recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants, but played back only silence to the other set of plants. When caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants, the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars. 'What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defences,' co-author Rex Cocroft, said. 'This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.'", "abstract": "A new study has found that plants can feel themselves being eaten alive and can even tell what type of creature is attacking them.

The exercises also provide an operations training environment for participants such as unit-level intelligence experts, maintenance crews, and command and control elements.

{"article": "SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.\u00a0is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary, Blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance. The company has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale Tilikum to drown trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 at SeaWorld's Orlando park. The print and YouTube campaign that began on Monday also comes only a day before former SeaWorld trainer John Hargove is set to release a book detailing his experiences at the park, which could bring more negative attention to the company. However, SeaWorld senior corporate affairs officer Jill Kermes claims the timing of the campaign has nothing to do with Hargrove's book release, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Scroll down for video. SeaWorld is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary, Blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance. SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale Tilikum to drown trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 at SeaWorld's Orlando park. 'I think there's been a lot of misinformation out in the public about who we are and what we do,' said Kermes. 'It has been a one-sided conversation and this is an opportunity for us to give people the information they need so they can make up their own minds.' The campaign focuses on the marine-life theme park's efforts of caring for animals in captivity and in the wild, while'setting the record straight on false accusations by activists who oppose whales and other animals in zoological settings'. 'There's been a lot of misinformation and even lies spread about SeaWorld, and we recognize that it has caused some people to have questions about the welfare of killer whales in human care,' said David D'Alessandro, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in a memo on Monday. 'This long-term campaign will address those questions head on. We want to provide the facts, so people can make up their own minds on this important issue.' Jim Atchison (above), who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. Last week, the new President and CEO was named as Joel Manby, who will take over the role in April. The print advertisements are set to appear in publications including the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. They ads feature staff from SeaWorld such as veterinarians and researchers, who will explain how the company cares for its killer whales. The print ads began running on Monday and TV commercials will air next month, according to the\u00a0Orlando Sentinel. The marketing campaign will also  highlight the company's latest initiatives including a commitment of $10million in matching funds to study endangered killer whales in the wild. Last Monday, SeaWorld launched its  'Meet the Animals'  campaign which introduces individual animals as it gives a look into sea life. The YouTube campaign also shows videos of behind-the-scenes caring for SeaWorld's marine mammals by the company's veterinarians. Critics of that campaign said SeaWorld failed to explain that like orca whales and dolphins, sea lions fare poorly in captivity, as documented in an editorial by The Dodo. An official for the animal rights group PETA called SeaWorld's campaign 'a last-ditch effort.' PETA has led organized campaigns against SeaWorld. 'The tide has turned for SeaWorld,' said Jared Goodman, PETA's director of animal law. 'It's a last-ditch effort to sway a public that has already made up its mind.' It was reported in February that SeaWorld had a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall - due in part to Blackfish. Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers.

{"article": "The worry for England is that things could get worse before they get better. The cricket itself is bad enough. But we're thinking of events off the field: if they were handed the keys to ECB headquarters, the Borgias and the Chuckle Brothers would probably bicker less and command more gravitas than the current lot. One of the side-effects of England's horrible performance at the World Cup was to bring forward the moment when our game would have to confront itself. While they were still in the tournament, there was always the promise of a horizon to cross, an itch to scratch, a wrong to right. No longer. The most alarming development of another improbable week was Alastair Cook's outburst in Abu Dhabi. It was no coincidence that the most heartfelt press conference of his career took place beyond the grasp of the ECB (perhaps beginning the county season in the Middle East does have something to recommend it after all). England vice captain Jos Buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after their World Cup exit. England's exit at the World Cup was humiliating as they went out in Adelaide, Australia. England coach Peter Moores (left) at the end of the World Cup match between England and Bangladesh. But Cook was unhappy. More to the point, he hasn't got his head round his sacking as one-day captain. Neither fact reflects well on the English game. His cri de coeur came not long after coach Peter Moores had assured us that Cook had dealt with the disappointment of being axed only weeks before the World Cup. Thoughts returned to the days before that axing, when Moores stressed his support for Cook's leadership; once the leadership was over, Moores said it was 'the right thing to do'. Something is clearly being lost in translation. And it had better be reinterpreted fast: England are about to embark on 17 Tests in 10 months. It is a period that will define both captain and coach, assuming they emerge unscathed. Yet Cook also needs to be frank with himself. The reason he shouldn't have been sacked so soon before a World Cup was that he should have been sacked well in advance, and allowed to focus on what \u2013 until two years ago \u2013 he was good at: churning out Test runs. Instead, he has now been critical not just of the decision to sack him, but also \u2013 by implication \u2013 of Eoin Morgan's leadership. Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi. Alastair Cook trudges off the field in Abu Dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings. For more musings on matters cricketing, please follow us on Twitter: @the_topspin. Team insiders believe his words came out the wrong way. But had they been uttered by Kevin Pietersen, they would have brought howls of 'insubordination'. And Pietersen, lapping up the limelight once more, has loved every minute. Ever since Colin Graves appeared to suggest there was a way back, he has taken every opportunity to stay in the headlines. This is his prerogative, and it has at least served to expose the ECB's continued mismanagement of the saga. To hear the national selector James Whitaker dead-bat questions from the BBC last week was to wonder at the task awaiting the ECB's new head of communications, Chris Haynes. Meanwhile, confusion continues over what exactly Graves said to Pietersen. Reports vary: he's offered an olive branch, no he hasn't; he's assured Cook that Pietersen won't play for England again, no he hasn't; he's told Pietersen there are no guarantees, no he\u2026 you get the picture. And all this, remember, before Graves has even replaced Giles Clarke as chairman. In some ways, Graves deserves our sympathy: he has inherited a mess which he presumably didn't envisage while he was operating under the radar as Clarke's deputy. And his statement on Pietersen \u2013 play county cricket or there really is no hope \u2013 had the virtue of treating him like a member of civilised society. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches at the most to impress England's selectors. He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes. But the latest bout of confused messages, simmering feuds and egotistical grandstanding are a reminder that English cricket should be careful when it next mocks, say, the Pakistanis or the West Indians for presiding over complete chaos. It's over a year now since Pietersen was told to pack up his troubles in his old kit bag. Yet, in the eyes of the public, the ECB are no closer to moving on. On the contrary: the crowd watching the sideshow is threatening to outnumber those who can still be bothered with the cricket. Pietersen has played the media game with his customary flair, befriending those he once disdained. But it's up to the ECB to take charge.", "abstract": "England's cricket team is in disarray, with poor performances on the field and infighting off it.

The 34 year-old American gave her clearest indication yet that she would return before the end of her career following a 6-3 7-6 victory over Caroline Wozniacki that took her into the quarter finals. Venus has not played in March's high profile WTA event in the Californian desert since 2001 when, as has been well-documented, she made a late withdrawal from a semi-final match against her sister with a knee injury. Serena subsequently got a hostile reception when she played in the final. Venus Williams has suggested she will return to Indian Wells doe the first time since 2001. The elder Williams sibling reached the quarter finals of the Miami Open on Monday. Williams shakes hands after defeating Carloine Wozniacki in straight sets at the event in Key Biscayne. Rory McIlroy's former fiancee could not contend with Williams' game, going down\u00a06-3 7-6. The younger sibling ended the family boycott this year, and now it looks like both of them may well be back as well in 2016. Asked what she thought of Serena's warm reception at Indian Wells earlier this month Venus responded: 'It was wonderful to see. I definitely watched every moment, and it was great to see her and my family there. Next year will be a big year for us being an Olympic year. I can't exactly say what my schedule will be, but it was wonderful to see her reception.' Did that mean she had softened her own stance? 'Oh, yeah, absolutely. I have heard so much about how much the tournament has just improved in general in terms of the fans and the players. 'So it will be something to see for me.' Serena is comforted by her family after being jeered by the crowd when winning at Indian Wells in 2001. The world No 1 returned to the tournament this year where she reached the semi-finals. Williams plays a shot on the run during her fourth round victory over\u00a0Svetlana Kuznetsova in Miami. Venus said that she had not fully discussed the matter with Serena but went on:'I think really what Serena did and how she went about it was just awesome for me as a big sister to see, because I feel like usually I'm the big sister. I feel like in this instance she took the role of big sister. 'It was really nice. I love how, you know, we continue to protect each other no matter what. She did a fantastic job out there, even though she wasn't feeling her best. So like I said, I think the tournament's amazing. I also said next year is an Olympic year, so my whole focus is on trying to get to the Olympics. 'So I don't know what tournaments I'm going to play as long as I'm at the Olympics. That's my goal, to be healthy enough. So I think it would be awesome to return, but I don't know what my schedule is next year.

A con artist who told woman she was being convicted of tax fraud seemingly had an attack of guilt after finding out she was pregnant. Sarah Carr, who owns three event venue businesses in Denver, Colorado, told 9News that she received a voicemail on her cell phone from a man who claimed to be from the IRS. Ms Carr said she she rang the number back and broke down in tears at the news at 8am on Tuesday morning. The man told her there was a lien on one of her properties and Ms Carr said he was believable as he knew so many personal and private details about her business and finances. 'I just start crying,' Carr told KUSA. 'I said, 'I'm nine months pregnant...I don't know what I'm going to do.' 'And then he says, 'Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're pregnant?' and I said, 'Yes!' And he goes, 'I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, this is a scam. You're okay, we're scamming you. 'We were just trying to get money out of you. Please stop crying,'' Carr said. She said the man then hung up and ended the call. Ms Carr, who already has a young son, said her immediate relief at not owing money than turned to a mixture of anger and fear as the man had been so convincing due to his knowledge of her situation. 'I was like super happy that I wasn't' going to jail. But then I was just really freaked out,' Ms Carr said. Fake IRS agents have now targeted more than 366,000 people with harassing phone calls demanding payments and threatening jail as part of a huge nationwide tax scam that has cost taxpayers $15.5 million. More than 3,000 people have fallen for the ruse since 2013, Timothy Camus, a Treasury deputy inspector general for tax administration, said Thursday. Scroll down for video.

You're okay, we're scamming you. The scam has claimed victims in almost every state, Camus said. One unidentified victim lost more than $500,000. 'The criminals do not discriminate. They are calling people everywhere, of all income levels and backgrounds,' Camus told the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing. 'The number of complaints we have received about this scam make it the largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of our agency.' With tax season in full swing, the IRS is warning taxpayers about a huge nationwide scam in which fake IRS agents call people on the phone, demand payments and threaten them with jail if they don't pay. Some tips from the IRS to void the scam:. The IRS will never call about taxes owed without first mailing you a notice. The IRS will never demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount the agency says you owe. The IRS will never require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card. The IRS will never ask for credit card or debit card numbers over the phone.The IRS will never threaten to have you arrested for not paying. If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and asking for money, here's what the IRS says you should do:. If you think you might owe back taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. If you know you don't owe taxes, report the incident to the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, at 1-800-366-4484, or online at www.tigta.gov. The scam is so widespread that investigators believe there is more than one group of perpetrators, including some overseas. Camus said even he received a call from one of the scammers at his home on a Saturday. He said he had a stern message for the caller: 'Your day will come.' So far, Camus said, two people in Florida have been arrested. They were accused of being part of a scam that involved people in call centers in India contacting U.S. taxpayers and pretending to be IRS agents. 'These criminal acts are perpetrated by thieves hiding behind telephone lines and computers, preying on honest taxpayers and robbing the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars every year,' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 'Taxpayers must be more aware of the risks and better protected from attack and these criminals must be found and brought to justice.' The inspector general's office started warning taxpayers about the scam a year ago, but it has since ballooned. Tax scams often increase during filing season.

Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roy said: 'He is lucky to be alive and the case clearly highlights the risks for the entire community when off-road bikes are ridden in this way. 'Today's action is all about responding to the concerns of communities across Merseyside and targeting those people who we believe have been using scrambler bikes in a dangerous or anti-social way.

Henson hit headlines earlier this week by revealing in an interview that her son, Marcel Henson, was stopped in Glendale for no reason, then doing 'exactly everything the cops told him to do, including letting them illegally search his car'. 'It was bogus because they didn't give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for,' she told Interview magazine. However the just-surfaced dashcam footage, taken in October last year, shows that Henson drove through a lighted crosswalk as a pedestrian walked across.

Traffic stop: Footage has emerged of police pulling over Marcel Henson, son of actress Taraji P Henson, in Glendale, California, in October. Henson said this week her son was racially profiled during the stop. New footage: Despite Henson saying her son was pulled over for no reason, he actually ran a lighted crosswalk as a pedestrain crossed and admitted to having marijuana and Ritalin on him. Sobriety test: Marcel Henson, 20, told the officer he had smoked marijuana two hours before driving, and the officer asks him to get out of the car to see if he is under the influence, but determines he isn't. Taraji P. Henson saaid her son Marcel was racially profiled by police in Glendale and at tje University of Southern California. The mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in Hollywood last April. The knife turned out to be legal. Henson said he had a prescription for the marijuana but could not find it. He said he did not have a prescription for the Ritalin and that a friend had given it to him. However the officer, who seems very generous when dealing with Henson, lets the teen off with a citation for marijuana possession only. The dashcam footage was obtained by The Los Angeles Times, which noted that race did not seem to be a factor when Henson was first pulled over. 'I am not going to give you a citation for running that yellow because that would actually put a moving violation on your driving license, and you are going to have to go to traffic school and all that stuff, so I am helping you by not giving you a violation on it. All I am going to do is take the weed from you,' the officer can be heard saying in the video. The officer told Henson he could go to court with the citation and show proof he has a prescription for medical marijuana. Otherwise he could just pay a fine. 'It felt like this was a little better than the other one,' the officer said. 'I am giving this to you too because you smoked weed about two hours ago\u2026 and a warning if you have Ritalin on you and you're not supposed to, don't do it. 'That's a big violation and I wouldn't want to do that to you.' The boy's mother made her controversial comments to Uptown magazine earlier in the week. The Empire star said that not only was her son pulled over by police, but was stopped by cops at the University of Southern California for 'having his hands in his pocket.

Each man is forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group's location, movement and armament. All nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads. They pull the triggers without hesitation, sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground. The masked ISIS commander who introduces the latest senseless propaganda video says the men 'were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'. Scroll down for videos. Senseless: ISIS has released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists. Murder: The blindfolded and shackled men were led onto a bridge in an unknown location in the Middle East before being shot by masked extremists. Forced confessions? Before their deaths, each man claims responsibility for spying on ISIS, although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress. Doomed: The men are eventually escorted out of the building - clad with Islamic State insignia - to their deaths. Graphic footage ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood. But the scenes in which the senseless murders take place come six minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the seven minute video. It begins with a bizarre setup of a masked ISIS commander sitting in a corporate office, flanked by two other soldiers. He say that Islamic State succeeded in arresting an entire 'cell' of spies who were tasked with monitoring their locations back to their commanding officer. The unnamed militant then claims three of the men who squealed on the others, adding: 'We took the investigation to a judge and after collecting evidence, they were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah.' Each of the nine kidnapped men are then forced to give interviews before their impending doom - presumably under duress - in which they confess to being spies. Their nationalities and professions are as yet a mystery, but some of the men look visibly terrified as they speak in trembling Arabic. This is the second video of an Islamic State execution to surface this week following the equally brutal mass murder of eight 'informers'. Mastermind: The second gruesome execution video to surface this week begins with a masked fighter who says the men were'sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah' Captured: The unnamed ISIS commander also claims that three of the alleged spies squealed on their comrades. Execution: After being escorted onto what appears to be a bridge by armed fighters, the blindfolded men are instructed to kneal. Terror: The gruesome video is the second to surface this week following the footage of eight other alleged spies being killed in a similar way on Thursday. In the video which emerged on Thursday, the terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in Syria and Iraq. The gruesome propaganda video cut from scenes of the men being killed to footage of people who ISIS claims were killed during Coalition attacks on its locations. Cutaways include footage of dead children underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and body bags. As with the latest video which features interviews with the doomed captives, it featured graphics which 'profiled' each of the men about to be murdered.

The fighter jet is the centerpiece of the British Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier-based fleet, and dozens have already been ordered. Trouble in the skies:\u00a0The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load (file photo) The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. Though it's mandated that an F-35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The problem will not affect the Royal Navy's consignment of F-35Bs, however, as its aircraft are to carry different weapons. The F-35 program will reportedly cost more than \u00a32.5billion over the next decade. The F-35B is one of three variants of the F-35 program - and it's proved the most expensive and most troublesome to get off the ground. The F-35B features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings - like a helicopter. The F-35 in general - and the F-35B in particular - has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays.

The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth(pictured) and the HMS Prince of Wales. Since work began in 2007, an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete. Artists impressions of the ship's flight deck released before construction was underway. When completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program, said in an\u00a0Inside Defense\u00a0interview last week that changes are being made to the jet so it can be released on schedule. DellaVedova also said that Lockheed Martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015. 'This is not a new issue to us,' DellaVedova told Inside Defense. 'We've been working with the SDB II program office and their contractors since 2007. 'The fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support SDB II that have already been incorporated into production F-35 aircraft. 'These minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing SDB [II] developments.' Inside Defense reported that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external SDB IIs are in fact meant to go on the F-35B. An MoD spokesman said: 'The Small Diameter Bomb II is not part of the UK's planned weapon inventory for the Lightning II. The programme to integrate weapons from the UK inventory onto Lightning II is on track to deliver initial operating capability as planned in December 2018.' Bombs away:\u00a0The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, defense contractor Raytheon says. Defense contractor Raytheon is behind the SDB II bomb. The company proclaims on its website 'SDB II can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing aircrews' time in harm's way. 'The weapon's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous, larger weapons that required multiple jets. 'SDB II's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers, as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions.' The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, the company says. The SDB II weapons system is fully accommodated by both the F-35A - the Air Force version - and F-35C - the US Navy version, company executive Jeff White told Inside Defense. White told the news outlet 'I think it's just the B. When we did our fit checks on the JSF, the A and the C basically had the same bay.' 353 F-35Bs are being bought by the United States Marines Corps, Inside Defense reported.

Now scientists have proved home-grown produce is not just tastier but healthier too. A study, carried out by experts at Kew Gardens, found that tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health-improving nutrients than those that are mass-produced. Flavoursome: A Kew Gardens study found that home-grown tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health-improving nutrients than those that are mass-produced. The concentration of natural sugars, anti-oxidants and nutrient rich compounds called phenols peaked in the home-grown tomatoes, the study for a BBC show revealed. Professor Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew, claimed mass-market tomatoes are often bred for their appearance rather than quality, that herbicides are used and that they are harvested early and artificially ripened to improve shelf life. She said all these things can damage the flavour and the nutrient level in the fruit. 'Supermarkets are often looking for tomatoes that are a particular size because that's how the public want it,' she said. 'Some of these tomatoes are smaller and they don't grow in a uniform size, which makes them difficult for supermarkets to sell. It's about educating the public. People don't mind if something grown in their garden is not beautifully round but would they buy it from a supermarket?' One example is the Gardener's Delight cherry tomato, which was found to contain three times as much sugar as the shop-bought variety, giving it a far sweeter taste. While this experiment was with tomatoes, Professor Simmonds said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables.

The Blues were eliminated from the competition after a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night sent Paris Saint-Germain through to the quarter finals on away goals.

{"article": "With 60 years of managerial experience between them, Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger have more big match experience than most coaches still involved in European football. They have, as they saying goes, forgotten more about the game than many people will ever know. Games like this, however, still throw up unique questions and challenges, both before and during play, and on Monday night he two men faced one of their biggest nights of the season in a competition their respective clubs are unusually desperate to win. Here, Ian Ladyman assesses how they shaped up at Old Trafford. TEAM SELECTION. Managers are paid to make the right calls and sometimes that involves an element of risk. Wenger\u2019s decision to include Danny Welbeck ahead of Olivier Giroud seemed baffling. Giroud had scored five goals in his last five games and it was hard to think Welbeck would have anything in his repertoire that his former team-mates in the United ranks didn\u2019t know all about. For an hour here it seemed as though the Arsenal manager had blundered a little. Arsenal were familiarly quick and progressive through midfield but Welbeck seemed unable to hold of possession long enough to bring his supporting players Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain in to play. Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal jumps in the air after putting his side in the lead. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney cancelled out Nacho Monreal's opener. Ultimately, though, Wenger\u2019s decision was vindicated when Welbeck was bright enough to anticipate Antonio Valencia\u2019s back pass and calm enough to win his subsequent challenge with David de Gea and score the winner. For their part, it was surprising to see United without their best passer, Michael Carrick, but they still had a bold look about them at the start and that was indicative of the fact that this was a game Van Gaal wished to win at the first attempt. Daley Blind was selected as United\u2019s only holding player and that, in turn, released Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini to try and hurt Arsenal further up the field. Most interesting, though, was Van Gaal\u2019s decision to select Ashley Young as a traditional winger. Young has looked good going forward from left-back this season and by shunting him further up the field, Van Gaal gave him licence to trouble young Hector Bellerin. It was a plan that worked early on, as Bellerin was booked for a foul, but Young couldn\u2019t maintain the threat and spent too much time in his own half. Ashley Young celebrates with Rooney following the Manchester United and England captain's equaliser. TACTICS AND STYLE. Wenger is nothing if not brave when it comes to these games and that was reflected in his decision to pair Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil as central players. Some Arsenal supporters may have wanted their team to look rather more secure and at times the visiting team did look vulnerable when Fellaini edge forwards to impose his unique brand of physicality on to the Arsenal central defenders. Arsenal\u2019s three-man attacking formation took a while to click but the holders\u2019 full-backs Bellerin and Nacho Monreal got significant change out of their opposite numbers, forcing them back, and this allowed the visiting team to stretch the play in a fashion that made United look distinctly uncomfortable. Santi Cazorla (second left) vies for the ball with United trio Young, Daley Blind and Marouane Fellaini. When United did have the ball it was clear they had been instructed to play with more urgency. Certainly Van Gaal\u2019s team moved the ball more quickly early on and tried to deliver telling balls between two Arsenal central defenders that can be vulnerable, something that paid dividends when Wayne Rooney equalised. Unfortunately, this is not a United team that has any great confidence or belief and as soon as things started to go wrong their game plan fell apart to the extent that the final 20 minutes saw them launch a succession of long balls up towards Fellaini. That, it must be said, was startlingly unsophisticated. One final question, here: If Rooney is the man chosen to take your free-kicks from out wide, just what does that say for the abilities of Young and Angel di Maria? TECHNICAL AREA SAVVY. Wenger once got so animated here that he ended up standing on the platform behind the dug-outs after being sent from his seat. It was not a good look but then his team were on the brink of a defeat at the time so perhaps he was to be excused signs of madness. On Monday night he was visible at times and contributed a lovely 360 degree dance after the first goal. A place in Strictly Come Dancing beckons in retirement, perhaps. Van Gaal, meanwhile, rarely ventures from his seat and whether that is the right thing or not depends on whether you think footballers actually benefit from a frantic man in a suit screaming at them while they are trying to put in to", "abstract": "Arsene Wenger and Louis van Gaal faced each other in a competition their respective clubs are unusually desperate to win.

{"article": "A grandson was today accused of illegally owning a dangerous dog which killed his grandmother in a savage attack in her home. Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard Craig Greve, 23, of Cardiff, was the owner of the American bulldog which was dangerously out of control. Rhona Greve, 64, of Ely, Cardiff, suffered 16 bite wounds to her neck and face after the dog - named Solo - attacked her last Friday evening, the court was told. She later died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. Scroll down for video. Mother-of-four Rhona Greve, 64, (pictured) died after she was savaged by a dog in her own home. Mr Greve is charged with both having a dog while being banned for life from doing so, and being the owner of a dangerously out of control dog. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at the magistrates' court hearing today. Members of his family and friends were in the public gallery for the hearing which lasted nearly an hour. The case has been sent to Cardiff crown court and he was remanded in custody. Her heartbroken daughter Clare said: 'I got the call to say: \"Your mum's been savaged by a dog\". 'It all happened so quickly. When I arrived at hospital she was already gone. 'They asked me if I wanted to see her body but I didn't have the heart. I didn't want to see her like that. She added: 'She was a brilliant mum and she didn't deserve to go like that. I can only imagine what Craig is going through right now. He must be devastated. 'We're all waiting to find out more about what has happened. You just never expect something like this.' Officers were called to the home in Ely shortly after 10pm on Friday to reports that a 64-year-old woman had suffered serious injuries. The court heard how grandson Greve lived with his grandmother - and was brought up 'like her own child'. She took him in when his mother Amanda, 40, had a stroke at a'very young age'. Greve told police how he returned home to find the American bulldog standing above his grandmother in the kitchen. Mrs Greve suffered neck and face injuries after she was mauled by the out-of-control dog. Prosecutor Katy McMahon said: 'As a result of the dog being out of control, it has caused harm to Rhona Greve resulting in her death. 'She sustained significant injuries and died later in hospital.' Police were called by neighbours and the court heard officers said the dog was'snarling with blood on its teeth.' Miss McMahon said: 'Officers described the dog as going beserk.' His lawyer Trudy McBride said: 'This is an extremely tragic case. He is the grandson of the deceased. He saw what happened and was with her when she passed away.' Rhona had been a full-time carer for her husband Malcolm as he battled lung disease emphysema. After his death more than five years ago Rhona loved the American bulldog keeping her company. A friend said: 'She loved that dog and he kept her company. We can't think what happened to make Solo turn like that.' Another said: 'She was a real lover of people and their pets. She loved having people around and their pets too.' Rhona had four children - three daughters and a son who died at a young age. She also had 21 grandchildren. Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house which has now been taped off by police. Local councillor Susan Goddard said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, it's just too awful to comprehend. It's terrible.' A 17-year-old boy who was also arrested in connection with the incident has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. Supt Andy Valentine of South Wales Police's eastern division said: 'This is tragic incident, which I know will shock and upset the local community. 'The woman's family are understandably extremely distressed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.' Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house in Ely, Cardiff, which has now been taped off by police. Supt Valentine reassured local residents it was an 'isolated incident'. According to NHS data, as of 2014 there have been 4,263 admissions to hospitals in Wales from dog attacks since 1999.

{"article": "North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles more than 300 miles into the sea in what has been called an 'armed protest' against military drills in the South. A spokesman for the secretive state threatened'merciless strikes' against South Korea and its ally the U.S., which helps conduct the military drills every year and insists they are just defensive. The war between the two Koreas is still active because it ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and left a heavily armed two-and-a-half mile wide zone along the border. Making a statement: South Korean TV shows the two missile tests by the North today. The secretive state warned there would be'merciless strikes' against routine military exercises carried out south of the border. Training: South Korean soldiers begin the annual military exercises near the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas - which despite its name is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world. North Korea regularly conducts test firings of missiles, rockets and artillery, but they are often timed to express the country's dissatisfaction with actions by Washington and Seoul. The missiles were fired early this morning at the start of military drills which are due to run until the end of April. Fired from the west coast, they flew around 300 miles across the width of North Korea before landing in waters off the east coast, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. Spokesman Kim Min-seok called the launches an 'armed protest' against the South Korea-U.S. drills and a challenge to peace on the Korean Peninsula. UN resolutions prohibit any ballistic missile test by North Korea, and Mr Kim said Pyongyang appeared intent on triggering a'security crisis'. 'We will respond sternly and strongly to any provocation,' he added. A statement carried by North Korea's state-run news agency said: 'The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war. Anger: Protesters gathered today near the U.S. Embassy in the South Korean capital Seoul. Uncompromising: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has taken an aggressive stance against the West. 'The only means to cope with the aggression and war by the U.S. imperialists and their followers is neither dialogue nor peace. They should be dealt with only by merciless strikes.' Officials in the North Korean capital Pyongyang claim the drills are 'intolerable aggression' and preparation for an invasion - but South Korea says they are simply routine exercises. The largest element of the two drills that began today is Foal Eagle, an eight-week exercise involving air, ground and naval field training, with around 200,000 Korean and 3,700 US troops. The other is a week-long, largely computer-simulated joint drill called Key Resolve. Around 28,500 American soldiers are deployed in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from the North. North Korea has threatened attacks, including nuclear strikes, on the U.S. before, although it has never demonstrated its missiles could reach the U.S. mainland. During the 2013 drills, tension rose amid North Korean rhetoric that included vows of nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul. North Korea has carried out three nuclear tests - in 2006, 2009 and 2013. In January, the North offered a moratorium on further tests if this year's joint drills were cancelled - a proposal rejected by Washington as an 'implicit threat' to carry out a fourth atomic detonation. Peace talks: There were hopes of the third summit between the Koreas since 1953, but the prospect is dim. Threats: Protesters outside the embassy. People floating anti-Pyongyang flyers by balloon could be targeted. Jeung Young-Tae, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Pyongyang was unlikely to conduct a fourth test just to protest against the exercises. 'Nuclear tests carry more significance than that,' he said. 'On the other hand, there is the chance of a mid- or long-range missile test. 'I would say that a demonstration that it could deliver a nuclear warhead would be more threatening to the world than an actual nuclear test'. A new research report by U.S. experts published last week estimated that North Korea could be on track to have an arsenal of 100 nuclear weapons by 2020. In a further sign of rising tensions, North Korean state-run website Uriminzokkiri warned today of a fierce response to any attempt by South Korean activists to float anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border by balloon. 'The response might not just be a few shots of gunfire but cannons or missiles,' the website said. The two Koreas floated the possibility earlier this year of holding what would be the third summit between their leaders since the countries were divided 70 years ago. It is not certain whether the meeting will take place because the two countries disagree on terms.", "abstract": "North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles into the sea in protest against military drills in South Korea.

Writer and director Wood cut unused footage of Bela Lugosi after the horror legend died. He then used his wife's chiropractor as a stand in for other scenes using a cape to hide his face- despite his being nearly bald and significantly taller than the deceased actor. The low-budget film also featured poor special effects such as flying saucers dangling from visible strings, ropey sets and laughable dialogue. Walcott had refused the role of alien-fighting pilot Jeff Trent at first, describing the script as 'gibberish.' But he was later persuaded that his name could add a little credibility to the film and agreed to star- without his agent's knowledge. It was a decision that came back to haunt him as he was consigned to the annals of film history for that very role.

The Bangladeshi woman, from Tower Hamlets, east London, who served five years for attempted murder in 2009, has been allowed to remain in the UK after the Court of Appeal ruled it was a 'truly exceptional\u2019 case. The Government appealed but the woman, of Tower Hamlets, East London, was yesterday granted leave to remain. Court of Appeal judge Lord Justice Pitchford said the case was \u2018truly exceptional\u2019. He said: 'The circumstances of the offence, the bitter\u00a0suffering of [the mother] following the offence and the clear benefit to the\u00a0victim of the offence of continued face to face contact with her mother\u00a0rendered this case truly exceptional. 'In short, despite the generic public interest in deportation of foreign\u00a0criminals, there was no public interest in further punishing the victim of\u00a0the crime. 'In my view, the combined circumstances of the crime and its consequences were exceptional and the First-Tier Tribunal was entitled to conclude that\u00a0separation, which was likely to be permanent, would be cruel both to the\u00a0offender and to the victim.' The judge heard the appeal with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lady Justice King,\u00a0who both agreed with the decision.

{"article": "New Delhi (CNN)Thankfully, no one was wounded after crude bombs were hurled at a Tamil news station in India on Thursday. But the loud explosions injured a vital part of the world's largest democracy: free speech. Last week, when India's government and a British documentarian faced off over a film featuring a man imprisoned for a 2012 gang rape in South Delhi, a little-known channel hundreds of miles away in southern India was waging its own battle. Hardline Hindu groups were angry with broadcaster Puthiya Thalaimurai for filming a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace -- called mangalsutra in Hindi and thaali in Tamil -- worn by married Indian women. For them, the contents, as shown in the promos, were offensive to Hindu culture. The station planned to release the program Sunday, International Women's Day. But it canceled the telecast after demonstrations took place outside its office. Protesters allegedly attacked one of its cameramen. Four days later, the channel came under fire again, when four men on two motorbikes threw bombs into its compound in a predawn attack, authorities say. Six people involved in the bombing have been arrested, said S. George, the commissioner of the southern Indian city of Chennai. Their leader turned himself in separately, claiming responsibility for the attack, police said. \"The show wanted to give women a platform. We welcome all opinions and thoughts. But you cannot strangle freedom of free expression by violent means and threats,\" said Shyam Kumar, the CEO of New Generation Media Corp., which runs Puthiya Thalaimurai. \"We condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms,\" he told CNN. 'India's Daughter,' the film banned by India: What did it show? But India is no stranger to censorship imposed legally or forced by rowdy protesters. The country's constitution guarantees freedom of expression, but not without restrictions. Communities or people claiming their religious sentiments were hurt by anyone else's opinion can file a lawsuit. Authorities can seek restraining orders from local courts -- as they did to ban the recent BBC documentary \"India's Daughter\" -- by citing potential disorder. Earlier last year, Penguin India withdrew \"The Hindus: An Alternative History,\" a book by American academic Wendy Doniger, after a local advocacy group accused the writer of denigrating Hinduism. In December, a Bollywood movie, \"PK,\" came under attack over similar accusations when mobs tore apart its posters in parts of India. A satire on religious rituals, \"PK\" became a roaring success by being one of the country's highest-grossing movies. But India, home to one of the world's largest film industries, has blocked several movies from screening. At least two films were not allowed last year. One of them featured the lives of the Sikh assassins of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and the other centered on the violence in Sri Lanka in the closing months of its civil war. Hounded by protests over his novel, Perumal Murugan, a Tamil author, announced quitting writing in a dramatic post on Facebook in January. \"Perumal Murugan, the writer is dead. As he is no God, he is not going to resurrect himself. He has no faith in rebirth. As an ordinary teacher, he will live as P Murugan. Leave him alone,\" he  said on Facebook two months ago. Religious and caste-based organizations had slammed his novel \"Madhorubhagan,\" which depicted a childless wife taking part in an ancient festival allowing consensual sex between strangers. Just last week, India blocked the BBC from airing \"India's Daughter\" because it included comments from one of the men convicted of raping a young student in a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012. The reason: The inmate's views could create unrest. \"There's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion. It's a medieval mindset. What India needs is a concerted effort to move beyond it and embrace free expression in totality,\" said Kumar, the New Generation Media chief executive.", "abstract": "A Tamil news station in India, Puthiya Thalaimurai, cancelled the broadcast of a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace worn by married Indian women after hardline Hindu groups protested outside its office and attacked one of its cameramen.

In fact, at Coventry City, the midfielder found the experience of being an inferior player to a manager in his early 40s about as palatable as Strachan\u2019s famed longevity-fuelling concoction of porridge, bananas and seaweed. If O\u2019Neill\u2019s injury-scarred spell at Highfield Road was not the most notable of an otherwise successful career, the Northern Ireland manager retains a high regard for his Scotland counterpart and hopes the pair can soon share success in the international arena. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has been preparing his side to face Gordon Strachan's Scotland. Strachan's side will be hoping to go into their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar on the back of a win. Scotland have not qualified for a major tournament since France 98, while Northern Ireland have not been seen at a Finals since the days when Brazil\u2019s Josimar rocketed one of the all-time great World Cup goals past Pat Jennings. But on the road to France 2016, Scotland are third in Group D, while Northern Ireland are second in Group F. As the two nations face off in a friendly at Hampden, O\u2019Neill hopes both men can lead their respective countries out of the international wilderness. \u2018I played under Gordon at Coventry \u2014 it\u2019s always a concern when the manager is a better player than you,\u2019 quipped the 45-year-old former Dundee United and Hibs midfielder. \u2018Other than that it was fine. It was a bit unfortunate that injuries thwarted my opportunity at Coventry but it was evident back then what type of manager Gordon was going to be. \u2018He had the ability to motivate and to invigorate. He knew how to get players to respond to him. So it doesn\u2019t surprise me how well he has done with Scotland. He was a great appointment and exactly what Scotland needed at that time. Scotland national team boss Strachan, pictured in 2001, coached O'Neill during his time as Coventry manager. \u2018It\u2019s pretty evident the improvement they have made under Gordon. And having played half my career up here, it would be good to see both countries qualify for the Euros. \u2018We\u2019ve been nearly 30 years away from a major tournament. Scotland haven\u2019t quite had that to deal with - but I\u2019d love to see both countries do it.\u2019 O\u2019Neill still lives in Edinburgh and remains an avid viewer of the Scottish game, not just because it is home to several Northern Ireland internationals. He believes football in this country is in ruder health than many outsiders \u2013 and insiders \u2013\u00a0perceive amid the often unrelenting negativity that has accompanied the collapse and pained rise of Rangers. \u2018I watch Scottish football a lot,\u2019 said O\u2019Neill, who may not risk Aberdeen striker Niall McGinn\u2019s hamstring but could start with two Manchester United centre backs in Jonny Evans and debutant Paddy McNair. \u2018There are now potential internationals of the future getting their chance in first-teams in the Premiership and Championship and that can only be good for the Scotland national team. \u2018There\u2019s been too much negativity about Scottish football at times, obviously because of what\u2019s gone on at certain clubs. But the game is in a lot healthier state than people give it credit for.\u2019 Manchester United team-mates Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair are expected to start in defence.

We had a lot of success there with Rangers but my last game, the League Cup Final, stands out. Celtic were always kind of favourites before we went into any Old Firm game and they had the upper hand before that game. But I scored a goal and we won the cup that day. \u2018I was lucky to have four years at Rangers and it was disappointing how it ended. That was the hardest thing to take. But I\u2019ll always look back on it as one of the most important and enjoyable periods in my career. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis, pictured in Janaury 2012, returns to his former stomping ground. \u2018It\u2019s a bit of an impossible subject to talk about (leaving) because you\u2019re never going to please everybody with what you say.

The CEO was surprised by the reaction she caused inside the inquiry, with victims standing up and applauding her as she left. She reported the assault to NSW police in 2009 when allegations about sexual abuse at Knox were emerging. Ms Perry's school, Roseville College, and Knox Grammar had been jointly staging the musical 'Guys and Dolls'. During one rehearsal, Dr Paterson, who the show's producer, singled her out, the commission heard on Monday. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. Ms Perry, who heads Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, told the commission former headmaster Ian Paterson groped her. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and [I] felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' The now 41-year-old, who was in her teens at the time of the 1989 incident, said students cheered when he touched her bottom and genitals. Ms Perry, now 41, was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said.

{"article": "Experts have called for a 'turbocharged' campaign to rid the world of tobacco by 2040. Leading experts have called for a 'turbocharged' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040. The sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years, leading public health researchers have today said. They claim one billion deaths from smoking could be averted by the end of the century, if action is taken now. But a  global campaign will only work with the support of governments as well as with stronger evidence-based action against the tobacco industry, they warn. Professors Robert Beaglehole and Ruth Bonita, from the University of Auckland in New Zealand have called on the United Nations to lead efforts against the sale and consumption of tobacco. They warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world, tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade, notably in Africa and the Middle East. With global population rising, there could still be more than a billion people smoking in 2025 unless urgent action is taken, it is claimed. The call to arms in the fight against smoking comes in a series of articles published in the Lancet medical journal and will be launched at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Professor  Beaglehole,  said: 'The time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products. 'A world where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now, but only with full commitment from governments, international agencies, such as UN and WHO (World Health Organisation), and civil society.' Global tobacco regulation should be 'turbocharged', with the United Nations taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco. The experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the 'big four' tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle-income countries. Their alleged tactics included industrial litigation, lobbying through third-party groups, and covert maintenance of political pressure disguised as 'corporate social responsibility'. Professor Anna Gilmore, another of the authors from the University of Bath, said: 'Contrary to industry claims, tobacco marketing deliberately targets women and young people. 'The tobacco industry continues to interfere with governments' efforts to implement effective tobacco control policies. 'If the world is to become tobacco free, it's vital that the industry's appalling conduct receives far closer scrutiny and countries which stand up to the industry's bullying tactics receive better global support.' A decade on from the WHO's landmark introduction of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), just 15 per cent of the world's population have adequate access to smoking cessation services. Moreover, less than one in 10 people across the world are covered by tobacco taxation at levels recommended by the FCTC. The experts led by Professors Robert Beaglehole and Ruth Bonita, from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, said the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years. That is despite research showing that increasing the cost of tobacco to consumers through taxation is one of the most effective ways to reduce consumption. In the last 10 years 50 million people have died as a result of tobacco use, indicating the FCTC alone is insufficient to achieve substantive reductions in the use of tobacco. While the implementation of the FCTC has been successful in some countries, particularly in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, the UK and some Pacific island countries, global action must now be taken. The authors note this can be achieved by accelerating the FCTC in those countries slow on the uptake. They said up until now too much focus has been on reducing the demand for tobacco. For further progress to be made, however, attention must turn to the supply, with greater regulation and closer scrutiny of the tobacco industry. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said: 'Along with many other rich nations, we have made good progress in reducing tobacco use over the past several decades. 'However, one in five UK adults continue to smoke, not through choice but because they are addicted. 'And 100,000 die early each year as a result. 'The authors of the Lancet articles are right that we need to do more to tackle the tobacco industry and to make it pay for the damage it does. 'This is just what the tobacco levy currently being consulted on by HM Treasury could achieve. 'But it is essential that the money raised should be used to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up this deadly habit.'", "abstract": "Leading public health researchers have called for a 'turbocharged' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040.

Babs Arogundade, 28, who also owned a Bentley, lived a life of luxury and regularly splashed out thousands of pounds on champagne and expensive jewellery including diamond-encrusted Rolex watches. However, his gangster lifestyle came to light when he was caught stashing lethal weapons in the boot of 27-year-old mother Bianca Willoughby's car in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Babs Arogundade, 28, (left) stashed an\u00a0arsenal of guns and ammunition in the boot of mother Bianca Willoughby's (right) car in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in exchange for letting her friend use his\u00a0Maserati. Police found four shotguns, a loaded Smith and Wesson handgun and a Winchester rifle when they raided the vehicle during a surveillance operation focusing on Arogundade's criminal lifestyle. His crimes were outlined at the Old Bailey on Friday, where he was convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs and possession of firearms. The court heard how Arogundade often frequented expensive West End nightclubs and met Ms Willoughby two nights before he was caught in May 2013. She is said to have agreed to help him with 'a favour' after she went to his home in St John's Wood, north west London, to ask for financial support for her business. The 'favour' was to look after bags filled with the weapons in exchange for him allowing her friend to borrow his expensive Maserati for a wedding. Prosecutor Tom Wilkins told the court about the operation on May 27, 2013, which led to the conviction of the 'charismatic gangster'. He told the Old Bailey: 'Armed officers intercepted a blue Honda Civic parked in Hemel Hempstead and found Willoughby sitting in the driver's seat with her four-year-old son sitting next to her. 'Inside the boot was four shotguns, a hand gun and a rifle together with compatible ammunition.' Arogundade was standing by the boot with a sports bag, the prosecutor said. He added: 'The prosecution say he brought that bag and would have used it to take back whichever firearms he was going to select from Willoughby's car.' The cache included a Smith and Wesson revolver containing one bullet, a Winchester rifle with seven rounds, a sawn off pump-action shotgun and three other shotguns with more than 300 shells. Mr Wilkins said the stash could'really only be described as an arsenal of guns and ammunition'. Police found four shotguns, a loaded Smith and Wesson handgun (pictured), a Winchester rifle and ammunition when they raided the Honda Civic during a surveillance operation focusing on his criminal ways. A shotgun was among the items seized from Ms\u00a0Willoughby's car. The Old Bailey heard that he kept the weaponry in her Honda Civic in return for allowing her friend to borrow his expensive Maserati for a wedding. Ammunition was also discovered hidden in bags in the boot of the car, which was occupied by Ms\u00a0Willoughby and her four-year-old son in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, when police raided it in 2013. Both Willoughby and Arogundade were arrested at the scene and the young mother told police she had agreed to do the favour following a visit to his home. She claimed he let her stay the night when she asked for financial help, but spent most of the time fending off unwelcome sexual advances. She told the court:\u00a0'He said: \"Did your friend enjoy the Maserati?\", he was saying it would be a lot of money to hire'. 'He said: \"I did you a favour, and I would like you to do a favour\".' The court heard a set of keys to the Maserati were later found stashed along with diamond-encrusted jewellery and expensive watches under a sink at an address in Isleworth, west London. Mr Wilkins said it showed Arogundade was'storing items at premises under the control of women he knew.' Despite the keys being found, it is believed the Maserati was sold on to a private owner before\u00a0Arogundade was convicted. Ms Willoughby was cleared of 15 offences of possessing guns and ammunition but a jury found Arogundade guilty of the same charges following a trial. He was also found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine along with 34-year-old co-defendant Fred Jones-Lartey, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Another co-defendant, Nicole Douglas, 28, also admitted the same charge after she was caught with a kilogramme of cocaine in her car on May 7, 2013 and was handed a four-year jail term. The court heard how the Class A drug was found wrapped in pink", "abstract": "A drug dealer named Babs Arogundade has been sentenced to 27 years in prison for stashing guns and ammunition in a young mother's car in exchange for letting her friend drive his Maserati. The cache included a Smith and Wesson revolver containing one bullet, a Winchester rifle with seven rounds, a sawn-off pump-action shotgun and three other shotguns with more than 300 shells. Arogundade was also found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine along with 34-year-old co-defendant Fred Jones-Lartey, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison."}

The Blues carry a 1-1 first-leg score into the game at Stamford Bridge after Courtois pulled off a succession of impressive saves at the Parc des Princes, which included denying the Sweden striker with a late stop.

Speaking to RMC, the Belgium international said: 'No, I'm not afraid. 'I played against him three weeks ago, and I played well. I hope to stop him again on Wednesday. I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.' 'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait. 'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0. We have to play to our strengths by trying to score goals and win the game.' Chelsea team-mates congratulate Courtois after another impressive performance against West Ham. Ibrahimovic scores from the penalty spot in PSG's 4-1 victory over Lens at the weekend. Courtois added: 'As we're playing at home and we drew 1-1 in the first leg, we're slight favourites. But with the team that Paris has, they also have a lot of hope. It's going to be a very close match. The small details will decide who goes through.' The Premier League leaders required a late goal by Demba Ba to eliminate the big spending French side at the quarter-final stage last season, but are arguably a better team this term. Nonetheless, Courtois is fully aware of the threat posed by the expensively assembled Ligue 1 champions. A late Demba Ba goal eliminated the French side at the Champions League quarter-final stage last season. Ibrahimovic will be playing on the same side as former Chelsea defender David Luiz (right) this time around. 'They're a team that can reach the final. To play them in the last 16 is very early in the competition. But that's the way it is,' he said. 'It's going to be a hotly contested game. Paris are a strong team. We're going to have to be very careful because we mustn't lose. 'If you play for a team like Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or PSG, the aim is always to win the Champions League. After that, it depends on the circumstances, the opponents you are drawn against. The aim is to win, but you have to see if it's possible.

{"article": "Usually when President Obama steps out on St Patrick's day, it's his brilliant green tie which steals the show. But today another accessory won the day - the enormous new'smart watch' festooning the Commander-in-Chief's wrist. Obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a Fitbit Surge device - as he walked around D.C. and met with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, and later lunched with congressmen on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video. New accessory: Obama sported the watch at a meeting today with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland. Check it: Obama has recently said that he was considering getting a Fitbit, or its rival the Apple watch. Device: The Fitbit Surge, pictured above in publicity photos, monitors heart rate, sleep and even the location of those that wear it. The Fitbit surge is an advanced piece of wearable technology that constantly monitors the body of the person wearing it. It uses LED sensors to measure heart rate, and can function as a calorie counter and GPS device. It also tells the time. The Surge model is the largest and most sophisticated Fitbit model, and sells for around $250. Obama has previous expressed his interest in emergent 'wearable' technology. In a February interview with Re/code, he seemed torn between getting a Fitbit and an Apple watch. Testing it out: Obama. Suiting up: Obama was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed. He said: 'I don\u2019t have a Fitbit yet, but I work out hard. Word is these Apple Watches might be a good companion for my workouts. So I\u2019m gonna see, I\u2019m gonna test it out.' The testing had evidently begun by Tuesday, when Obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements. Fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep, where it collects data while the subject is unconscious, and can wake them up with silent, vibrating alarms. One feature the President may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode. Fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the President is only allowed a Blackberry because of security concerns, which is incompatible with his new toy.

{"article": "Following their easy 4-0 win against Lithuania in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier England will face a much sterner test when they travel to Turin for an international friendly against Italy on Tuesday night. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham reminds you of 10 classic matches between the two sides. Italy 1-1 England, May 1933, friendly (Stadio Nazionale del PNF, Rome) This was the first ever meeting between the two sides, most famous for Italy\u2019s fascist leader Benito Mussolini cheering from the stands and being played in a stadium which translated into English as the \u2018National Stadium of the National Fascist Party\u2019. England\u2019s squad had to travel by train, setting off from London Victoria, and boat to get to Rome for the match. Italy\u2019s Giovanni Ferrari put the home side ahead in the fourth minute, but Arsenal striker Cliff Bastin scored his first England goal to cancel it out. The England football team pictured at Victoria station as they depart for Rome to face Italy in 1933. England 3-2 Italy, November 1934, friendly (Highbury, London) This game was labelled \u2018The Battle of Highbury\u2019 afterwards. Italy defender Luis Monti broke his foot in only the second minute and it was full of ferocious challenges. Italy were perhaps spurred on by reports at the time that Mussolini had offered the players an Alpha Romeo and \u00a3150 each if they won. That incentive back-fired when England went three goals ahead in the first 12 minutes; Eric Brook scoring three minutes in, adding a second after 10 and Ted Drake getting a third. They almost managed to throw it away, allowing Guiseppe Meazza to score twice in the 58th and 62nd minute, but held on for the win. England beat Italy 3-2 'The Battle of Highbury' during the second meeting between the two teams in 1934. Italy 0-4 England, May 1948, friendly (Stadio Comunale, Turin) The Italians were still world champions, having won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 and it being cancelled on the next two occasions due to World War Two. Italy\u2019s manager was the great double World Cup winner Vittorio Pozzo, but they were rocked by Walter Winterbottom\u2019s England. Stan Mortensen gave England a fourth-minute lead, Tommy Lawton added another and Tom Finney hit two second-half strikes within two minutes of each other. Goalkeeper Frank Swift, in his first match as captain, pulled off some stunning saves to keep Italy out with the score at 2-0. The result reverberated around the football world. Tom Finney scores England's fourth goal as England beat Italy 4-0 in Turin in 1948. Italy 2-3 England, May 1961, friendly (Olympic Stadium, Rome) Goals from Omar Sivori and Gerry Hitchens put the scores level at the break, but Sergio Brighenti struck another shortly after and with only 13 minutes to play England were still trailing 2-1. That was until Hitchens netted his second of the match and with only five minutes remaining former Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves got the winner. The match was 54 years ago, but still the last time England beat Italy on their own soil. England and Italy line up at the Olympic Stadium in Rome ahead of the Three Lions' 3-2 win in 1961. England 3-2 Italy, May 1976, friendly (Yankee Stadium, New York) England\u2019s greatest comeback against the Italians came in the USA Bicentennial Cup Tournament. They were two goals behind by half-time, both strikes coming from forward Francesco Graziani. But in a devastating eight-minute spell after the restart England were in front. Former Southampton striker Mick Channon netted a minute from kick off, Liverpool defender Phil Thompson levelled the match two minutes later and in the 53rd minute Channon got the winner. England's Joe Royle watches on during England's 3-1 win against Italy in New York in 1976. Italy 2-0 England, November 1976, World Cup qualifier (Olympic Stadium, Rome) This was the game which effectively stopped England qualifying for the 1978 World Cup. By the end of the qualifiers, even a draw would have been enough to send them through, but Giancarlo Antognoni scored first and Roberto Bettega, set up by a stroke of genius from Franco Causio, sealed the win for the Azzurri. England won all of their remaining matches and both teams finished the group joint on points, Italy three ahead on goal difference. It ended the reign of England manager Don Revie. The Italy players celebrate as\u00a0Giancarlo Antognoni gives them the lead against England in 1976.

{"article": "Ronny Deila has urged his Celtic players to embrace history - rather than fear it - when their aspirations of landing the Treble are put on the line in three showdowns with Dundee United. Celtic travel to Tannadice on Saturday in the Scottish Cup quarter-final - before a Hampden clash with Jackie McNamara's men in the League Cup final seven days later is followed by a Premiership meeting with the Tangerines the following weekend. Those three games will go a long way to determining if this Celtic team have the mettle to become just the fourth in the club's history to complete a clean sweep of domestic honours. Ronny Deila has urged his Celtic players to embrace history, rather than fear it, against Dundee United. Deila says his squad are fully aware that only Jock Stein's sides of 1967 and 1969 together with Martin O'Neill's class of 2001 had previously won the league, Scottish Cup and League Cup. But the Norwegian believes they should be inspired by the prospect of matching such heady feats rather than be daunted by it. 'Everyone is aware of that,' Deila said. 'That's a positive thing - and we really want it. But we have to do it on the pitch. Celtic's Efe Ambrose leaves the field dejected as St Johnstone celebrate their midweek win at Celtic Park. 'There is nothing to fear. These are positive things. We are not talking relegation. That's a hard pressure. We have everything to win and we are really looking forward to it. 'Dundee United have done a very good job this year. They have been a good team and are going to be a tough opponent. We have to be up for the game. 'The three games between them \u2013 they are going to be really tough. But to win the championship and trophies is going to be hard. Everybody knows that. The cup is one game so we have to do everything we possibly can before the game to be ready for it.' Celtic blew a chance to extend their lead over Aberdeen to nine points on Wednesday by losing 1-0 at home to St Johnstone. St Johnstone's Steven MacLean holds off Celtic's Jason Denayer during the game at Celtic Park in midweek. Yet, Deila was reluctant to be overly critical of his players, given the game was their eighth in 26 days. 'It is not the second and the third and the fourth game that is hard when you play so many games,' he insisted. 'It is when you come to the sixth and seventh after each other and also only having three days instead of four between games. 'It is a big difference because you can't get 100 per cent rested. You lose 10 per cent against Inter Milan and then go into the game against Aberdeen and lose another 10 per cent again because you can't rest. St Johnstone's Murray Davisdon clears the ball from Celtic's Virgil van Dijk during the midweek clash. 'You saw against St Johnstone that the first 25 minutes was good, we were controlling the game, playing quick and getting chances but suddenly it was like a click and the energy was out of the boys.' However, Deila fully expects his players to be back to their best by the time they arrive on Tayside. 'This is four days (rest) and that is an important thing. It is an extra day and also it is not 12pm but 3.30pm so I am glad we play on Sunday and we are going to bounce back on Sunday \u2013 I am confident of that.' As well as the absences of cup-tied pair Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, Deila has a number of injury concerns. Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong will miss the game against Dundee United as they are cup tied. 'Adam (Matthews) got a twisted ankle so hopefully he will be okay,' he explained. 'With Kris (Commons) and John (Guidetti) we will have to see but there are possibilities for both of them. 'With Emilio (Izaguirre) we have to think about what we will do. He is a possibility but we will be taking a risk with him. It is too early for (Mikael) Lustig or (Charlie) Mulgew.' Pressed on the prognosis for Izaguirre's broken finger, Deila said: 'Emilio doesn't need an operation but it might be a bit of a risk to play him.' John Guidetti could return to the Celtic squad to take on Dundee United at the weekend.", "abstract": "Celtic manager Ronny Deila has urged his players to embrace history rather than fear it, as they prepare to take on Dundee United in three crucial games.

{"article": "Washington (CNN)The Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts. People briefed on the case say Attorney General Eric Holder has signed off on prosecutors' request to proceed with charges, CNN first reported. An announcement could come within weeks.  Prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations. Menendez told reporters Friday night he has \"always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law.\" He added: \"And I am not going anywhere.\" Menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he couldn't answer questions at the news conference, held in Newark. The case could pose a high-profile test of the Justice Department's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers, having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the Constitution's Speech and Debate clause. The FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department's public integrity section, have pursued a variety of allegations against Menendez, who has called the probe part of \"smear campaign\" against him. The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. RELATED: FBI agents search office of Florida doctor known as Senator's donor. Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back  Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \"oversight.\" Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor.  Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities \"don't want to live by.\" \"If those countries can get away with that, they will,\" the senator said. \"And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage.\" Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included  allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about \"legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.\" The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury", "abstract": "The US Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts.

The page says, 'On April 10, 2012, United States Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills of the 82nd Airborne was critically injured on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan by an IED (improvised explosive device) while on patrol, losing portions of both legs and both arms. \u00a0He is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive such extensive injuries.' Mills received extended treatment from Walter Reed Army Medical Center,\u00a0CNN\u00a0reported last year. Now, he participates in a number of physical activities, including snowboarding, according to the television station. Mills told CNN 'I'm not wounded any more. I'm just a guy living life.'

In a trailer for a\u00a0documentary\u00a0on his life, 'Travis: A Soldier's Story,' Mills said 'You know, people call me a hero, but I'm not sure what part of it makes me a hero. I just had a normal day at work that turned ugly. 'About six seconds [after the explosion] I guess later, I woke up. My medic came running up at me. And about twenty seconds he had tourniquets on both legs and both arms. And I guess the last thing that was in my head was my baby girl. Am I ever going to see her again?' 'My goal was to let them know I keep working, I keep going hard,' he also said in the trailer. 'If I give up, I'm giving up on my family.' Arden built the main house in the town of Rome as her summer estate in the 1920s and later established the Maine Chance Spa at the site. Mamie Eisenhower, Judy Garland, and Ava Gardner were among the guests. The property once covered 1,200 acres but was subdivided after Arden's 1966 death. The Kennebec Journal\u00a0reported last year that the Maine Chance Spa was primarily a weight-loss spa, but also featured a number of beauty treatments.

The 24-year-old revealed that she's taken to wearing wigs to give her natural locks a break from styling because her tresses were becoming so damaged, they started falling out at the front. Speaking to HELLO! magazine, she said: 'My hair has been so damaged with heat and styling because most hairdressers still don't know what to do with Afro hair.' Scroll down for video. Jourdan Dunn is one of the most esteemed supermodels in the world but it seems the fashion industry has been taking its toll on her hair, which she reveals became so damaged, that it started falling out. Jourdan revealed that last year, her hair stylist, Renda Attia, insisted that she needed to give her hair a break and start wearing wigs. She continued: 'I mean, I had no hair around my hairline - it was like baby hair, it was so damaged. So I've been wearing wigs and having them changed every month, having lots of conditioning treatments and, finally, my hair is growing back. Jourdan, pictured, left, in September 2014 and, right, in July 2014, revealed that last year, her hair stylist insisted that she needed to give her hair a break and start wearing wigs. Charlotte Mensah, current British Hairdressing Awards, Afro Hairdresser of the Year and owner of award-winning salon Hair Lounge (charlottemensah.com) shared her top tips for not over-processing Afro hair with FEMAIL. She said: 'If you\u2019re experiencing hair damage and loss, the only option to minimise this is to begin a strict weekly regime of deep conditioning treatments.' She also recommends following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair. 'You need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods, 6-8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well,' she said. Avoiding products heavy in mineral oils, which block pores, is essential, as is gentle combing and regular trims. Jourdan, showing off her long locks in 2013, said she had no hair around her hairline so was wearing wigs and having them changed every month. FEMAIL caught up with the Maybelline New York ambassadress recently and we discovered that an exhaustive eight-step beauty regime that takes her nearly an hour a day is behind her flawless supermodel skin. Sharing her 'hardcore' beauty regime, Jourdan told us: 'I visited Tokyo and became obsessed with their skincare, which is very advanced. Their regimes have loads more steps but I incorporated some of their techniques into mine and developed my own eight step regime. 'It takes me a good twenty minutes in the morning and then about half an hour in the evening.' The secret behind her flawless skin? An eight step skincare regime and lip balm as eyeshadow and cheek tint.

'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised. She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in. 'I like to eat healthy,' she said.

The BBC declined to say what the meeting between Mr Yentob and Mr May was about. But it comes just days after the BBC chief said he hoped Richard Hammond and May would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host Jeremy Clarkson. The pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London, where Mr May was stopped by a passer by for an autograph. Mr Yentob said that, although he hoped the pair would stay on the show, he admitted the trio were'very attached'. He also told the Media Show that it was 'perfectly natural' for the pair to have reservations about continuing Top Gear without Clarkson. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' He added: 'The question of what happens next for Top Gear is a conversation which must go on between the controller of BBC2 Kim Shillinglaw, between Andy (Wilman - producer of Top Gear) and the team.'

Detectives have since said they have a duty to investigate 'where we believe an offence might have been committed' and experts claimed the Clarkson, 54, may be charged with actual bodily harm for his punch-up earlier this month. It appears Jeremy Clarkson has decided to take it easy after what must have been a tiring few weeks, sporting a slightly unkempt look as he left his home today. The former Top Gear presenter was earlier seen looking tired and unshaven as he left his flat in west London. Clarkson, who was dramatically dropped from the BBC following an investigation into a 'fracas' with a junior producer, wore a quilted jacket, checked shirt and jeans. Onlookers said he was 'less than his cheery self' as he made his way to a waiting cab - rather than driving himself.

{"article": "They've been madly in love since they laid eyes on each other as children, but it hasn't always been a smooth ride for this couple. Kirstie and Lyle Fisher were forced to keep their feelings secret for a number of years as they battled their biggest dilemma - the fact they happened to be first cousins. The Perth couple, who  are busy raising their three children, are now unashamed of their romance after finally going public with their relationship seven years ago. 'We're happy, we aren't hurting anyone by being together and our kids are fine and healthy... We were meant to be together,' Ms Fisher told Daily Mail Australia. Lyle and Kirstie Fisher from Perth in Western Australia have been together for seven years and are raising three children together - they also happen to be first cousins. 'People are allowed their opinions but we don't care what anyone else thinks.' Kirstie, 29, says it took a long time to realise not everyone would be accepting of their partnership after they dealt with disapproving family members and friends who abandoned them. 'The worst comment I've had is that our kids will grow two heads and we should go to Tasmania,' she said. 'Even last week I had a confrontation with a woman at my children's school. She told me I should be shot and my kids taken away from us. 'If what everybody said bothered us, we wouldn't be together. The fact is without Lyle, I am not a complete person. 'I love Lyle and I won't stop loving him.' Kirstie and Lyle, whose father's are brothers and grew up in different states, first met at a family wedding in Perth when she was nine years old. 'I thought he was cute, I didn't care that he was my cousin,' she said. 'But then he had to go back to Melbourne with his family and we didn't really talk again until I was 15. He got my mobile number off my brother and we started texting and chatting over MSN.' Lyle and Kirstie whose father's are brothers\u00a0first met at a family wedding in Perth when she was nine years old because they lived in different states. The couple tried to suppress their feelings when they were teenagers and eventually kept their feelings secret from their family for a number of years. Kirstie said she constantly pushed her feelings for Lyle aside because she knew they were related. 'Growing up you're always told they are your cousins, so you automatically assume if they're family then it is illegal to be together,' she said. When Kirstie turned 17, their aunty passed away and Lyle spent a week in Perth for the funeral. 'Up until my aunt's funeral there was the occasional time where I wished we weren't cousins. But we grew closer and by then I knew he wasn't just a cousin. 'I had really strong feelings for him.' Their first kiss was in Kirstie's bedroom while they were watching TV one night. 'I'm the only girl of three boys so they were very protective, but they didn't think anything of him being in my room because he was my cousin. 'From then on when we met up there were kisses and cuddles when no one was watching.' They talked several times about becoming a couple, but Kirstie often got cold feet because she was worried what people would think. Kirstie and Lyle went their separate ways for several years and she gave birth to her daughter Matilda (right) in a different relationship. They went public with their romance in 2008 and have two children together. Apart from Kirstie's father, who called the pair disgusting and hasn't spoken to them since, the couple say most people have been understanding. 'Eventually we went our separate ways and both went through relationships. I even had my first daughter with another guy,' she said. 'That relationship ended and Lyle was just at that point where he wanted to be together. 'I took my daughter to visit him in Queensland - he'd moved there a few years before. That's when we just gave up trying to ignore everything.' Lyle's mother sensed something was going on between the pair and confronted them with a stack of papers showing it wasn't illegal for them to be together and research on whether their children would be affected. 'He bought me a ring that day and we got engaged,' Kirstie said. They then had to bravely tell their immediate and extended families and admit it was a long process before people accepted it. Kirstie's daughter Miranda (left) has a different father, but the couple have two children together -\u00a0Alex, 5, and Zachary, 2.\u00a0Their daughter Danica died from complications during birth three years ago.

{"article": "A protester has been banned from all Qantas and Jetstar flights after staging a protest to stop the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker on her flight. Jasmine Pilbrow received an email from Qantas condemning the political statement and saying her 'actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group'. Ms Pilbrow boarded the plane objecting to the transfer and deportation of Puvaneethan, a 25-year-old refugee, who she believed would face persecution upon arriving back in Sri Lanka. Scroll down for video. Ms Pilbrow boarded the flight intent on stopping a Tamil asylum seeker from being sent back to Sri Lanka. Three people have been banned from flying with Qantas after a making a political statement against the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker. 'If he is sent back to Sri Lanka, he is likely to be imprisoned and tortured,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. Upon boarding the flight Ms Pilbrow refused to take her seat until Puvaneethan was taken off the plane and returned to the Melbourne Immigration Detention Centre. Ms Pilbrow says she learnt of her ban after reading an article published by\u00a0Fairfax Media last Tuesday. Jasmine discovered she was banned from Qantas flights after reading an article in The Age. Standing by her convictions: Ms Pilbrow \u00a0makes a speech during the International Day of Peace. 'I tried to follow up on the ban but there was no number for me to call. When I called Qantas headquarters they sent me to customer service who told me to fill out a form if I had a complaint about the ban,' Ms Pilbrow said, adding that she is seeking legal advice. 'Communication at Qantas needs to be fixed up.' Ms Pilbrow is not alone as two other passengers also received ban notices after deciding they would boycott the flight. Paul Leary, 51, and his female colleague were not involved in the protest but said they felt 'uncomfortable' upon learning of Puvaneethan's deportation. Mr Leary said he and a colleague felt faced with a'moral dilemma.' After his female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane Mr Leary also decided not to fly. 'We couldn't have been politer. We were travelling for business, we've both got executive roles in the organisation we work for\u2026 we were not aggravating or inciting other people,' Mr Leary told Daily Mail Australia. When he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from Qantas informed them at that point of any kind of ban. Ms Pilbrown, Mr Leary and his colleague have also been banned from flying with Jetstar and Qantas affiliates. Flyers were handed out at Melbourne airport asking the public to save asylum seeker Puvaneethan from torture. It wasn't until Mr Leary was returning from Darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to Melbourne with Qantas and was told he was subject to a no-fly ban. 'As a result of your actions on board QF838 from MELDRW on 2nd February, we have decided to issue you a No Fly Notification - Until Further Notice while the incident is investigated,' Qantas wrote. 'I still didn't hear anything by Monday and the only response I got was to submit a customer care complaint,' he added. After Mr Leary submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on February 16 informing him of his ban. Paul Leary was issued with this 'no fly notification' after he walked off a flight from Melbourne to Darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation. While Ms Pilbrow was dissatisfied by the way Qantas communicated the ban to her, she said it was not right for the other two passengers, who were not part of the protest, to also face a ban. Mr Leary has since complained to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal's human rights division saying the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief. 'If alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and I decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill I don't think I'd be banned. 'So the only reason I can see for this ban is my political beliefs\u2026 I'm not a known activist, I never have been. I'm in my fifties, I'm not a radical.' His female colleague is also  filing a complaint. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the passengers will remain on a no fly list until the incident has been investigated by the Australian Federal Police. 'As the incident is under investigation, it is not appropriate to comment further.' Ms Pilbrow says it is unfair that the other two passengers, who were not part of the protest, also received bans.", "abstract": "Three passengers, including a protester, have been banned from all Qantas and Jetstar flights after staging a protest to stop the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker on their flight.

Jaw-dropping scenery, ancient monuments and incredible wildlife are just a few of the 1007 sites earmarked for preservation by the organisation. But while well-known destinations such as Machu Picchu and the Acropolis in Athens may feature prominently on many intrepid explorers' 'to do' list, there are a number of stunning sites that the majority of us will simply never get to see.

Scroll down for video. The UNESCO World Heritage sites you may never get to see:. Afghanistan - Minaret of Jam. The glorious Minaret of Jam has was built in the 12th century by\u00a0Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din and marks the ancient city of Firuzkuh. The Minaret - in the Ghor province in Afghanistan - is covered in intricate brickwork and blue tiles arranged in Kufic inscription. It has survived countless wars and pillaging  the but Minaret of Jam - situated in a remote spot in the Ghor province of Afghanistan - is facing its biggest challenge yet. Extensive restoration work is needed to preserve the ancient structure, which is at risk from erosion from a nearby riverbed as well as a compromising tilt, similar to the tower at Pisa. The 65 meter needle was built in 1194 by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din, and is covered in intricate geometric brickwork as well as Kufic inscription in dazzling blue tiles - yet most people will never get to see the Minaret. Not only is the monument miles away from the nearest human settlement, it lies in a dangerous Taliban stronghold making travel to the region virtually impossible. North-West Iraq - Samarra Archaeological City. The Great Mosque and spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which has yet to be excavated. The archaelogical city at Samarra in Northern Iraq marks the site of a powerful Islamic capital city that ruled the region for much of the 9th century. The Great Mosque and soaring spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which have yet to be excavated. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, this rich cultural landscape is out of bounds. The city is located in the North-West of Iraq which remains in the grip of a bitter and ongoing conflict between local militia, Isis and Kurdish forces. When, and indeed if, the remaining site will be excavated is doubtful. Ancient city of Aleppo - Syria. The city of Aleppo was named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today. The Grand Mosque in the ancient city of Aleppo is at risk due to the ongoing civil war that blights the country. Syria's rich and glorious cultural heritage is demonstrated by the sheer volume of ancient monuments and historic sites that punctuate this embattled landscape. The ancient city of Aleppo contains elaborate mosques, palaces and evidence of a Graeco-Roman street layout, and there are signs of occupation dating back as far at the 10th-century BC. Hinting at its former glory, the city was even named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today.The country is in the grip of a bloody and bitter civil war that shows no signs of abating, and the Foreign Office advises against all travel to the war-torn country. Bethlehem - Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route. The Church of the Nativity is located within the Palestine occupied West Bank, an area that holidaymakers are advised to avoid. The alleged birthplace of Jesus: Positioned in the Palestine occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' Six miles south of Jerusalem, on the site Christians have called the birthplace of Jesus since the 2nd century, is the Church of Nativity. The oldest church in daily use in the world, the original basilica  was built in 339 AD, and parts of it survive below ground. A cave, over which the first Church was built, is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. While the site sees streams of religious visitors, its positioning in the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' means it's not one for the average tourist. And even if you do get to it, the church is in danger of crumbling - with the roof structure being vulnerable to lack of maintenance and repair. And due to an increase in the number of vehicles, as well as unregulated tourism, pollution now affects its outside walls. Its preservation relies on the unlikely partnership of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, so it remains", "abstract": "The article discusses UNESCO World Heritage sites that are at risk of being lost forever due to conflict or deterioration.

I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally 'boyish' things to try to fit in. When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me. My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help. When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep. I formed a sort of a 'f*** you' attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted. So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I'm surprised I didn't kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent's disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only", "abstract": "Tom Sosnik, a 13-year-old transgender teenager from Fresno, California, came out to his entire class after reading the suicide note of Leelah Alcorn, another transgender teen who took her own life.

Jane Hawking said money from 'firms who make millions in this country and yet do not pay any tax' should go towards those who need it. But speaking at a Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) reception at Buckingham Palace, Ms Hawking said she is not optimistic that anything will change. Scroll down for video. Newlyweds Sophie Hunter and Benedict Cumberbatch joined the Princess Royal for a Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) reception at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. She was joined at the event - hosted by the Princess Royal - by Prof Hawking, Benedict Cumberbatch and his pregnant wife Sophie Hunter, Michael Ball, Victoria Wood, Greg Davies, Jon Lee from S Club 7, and the presenters from Good Morning Britain. Prof Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (MND) in 1964 at the age of 22 and given just a few years to live. Now aged 73 and despite his illness leaving him almost completely paralysed, he is celebrated as one of the most brilliant scientists of the modern age. Professor Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (MND) in 1964 at the age of 22 and given just a few years to live. Now aged 73 and despite his illness leaving him almost completely paralysed, he is celebrated as one of the most brilliant scientists of the modern age. Speaking at the event first wife of Professor Stephen Hawking has said the Government needs a 'big overhaul' of its policy towards disabled people and has also called for a'stronger tax policy' to enable more funding. Ms Hawking said: 'The Motor Neurone Disease Association is doing very valuable work, and my first husband Stephen Hawking is the patients' patron, and so we're here to support him as well as to support the Association.' Asked if enough is being done to support patients with the disease and what needs to change, she said: 'I think they're doing very well considering that there's very little support for disabled people and their families from the Government. 'I think the Government needs to do a big overhaul of its policy towards disabled people, towards people with degenerative illnesses and it needs to provide much better support and it needs to have a system for vetting carers who go into people's homes.' Asked if she sees that changing, Ms Hawking, who is played by Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything, said: 'No, not at the moment, but I do think that a stronger tax policy, taxing firms who make millions in this country and yet do not pay any tax...the money should go towards this very particular cause.' Ms Hawking said she does not think the result of the general election will change anything either. The Theory of Everything is based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, which was written by Ms Hawking. It looks back to their days as Cambridge students in the early 1960s, when the then-cosmology undergraduate was first diagnosed with motor neurone disease, which went on to rob him of most physical movements. Cumberbatch played Professor Hawking in 2003 BBC drama 'Hawking' and has been a patron of the MNDA charity for 11 years. Reflecting on how she has been thrust into the limelight following the success of the film - for which Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for playing Prof Hawking - she said: 'It's been very exciting and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity so I think I can cope with it. It has meant that life has been very, very busy, very full, not a moment to spare.' Asked if she had any concerns about the film being made, she said: 'Of course I did, but I would not allow the film to go ahead. Each time Anthony McCarten, the producer, came to see me from 2004 onwards I said no every year. No, no, no. 'Until in 2013 he said well we've got an invitation to go to Working Title, the best British film company, so I said right we go. And I was so impressed with the sensitivity that they were bringing to bear on the project that I said yes we'll go ahead. 'Previously the time wasn't right for the family, for Stephen, for me, but then the time was right.' And how did she feel the first time she watched the film? 'Overwhelmed. It was beautiful,' she said. Other guests at the event included Victoria Wood (far left) and Michael Ball. Ms Hawking greeted her ex-husband in the Palace's white drawing room where the 41 guests, including the Princess Royal, mingled before dinner. Cumberbatch, who played Prof Hawking in a 2004 BBC drama, went over to the famous scientist and bent down to speak with him, as well as posing for photographs.

But at the launch of his party's pledge card today, he was photographed in front of no fewer than seven images of himself.

Mr Farage used the event in central London to boast that Ukip is 'quite reflective of what modern Britain is' Ukip hopes to use the election to make a major breakthrough into the Commons, securing enough seats to hold the balance of power in the event of a hung Parliament. Mr Farage said a strong showing for Ukip at May's election could boost the calls for electoral reform, which in turn could make his eurosceptics a 'big party in British politics'. He said: 'I've always thought there should be election reform but that is frankly irrelevant in the next 38 days. 'Yes, this is very hard for us because you find good Ukip support in Labour constituencies and in Conservative constituencies. 'Yes, that's a challenge but what we have to do is to get over the line in enough seats in this General Election campaign and then you'll see how many seats we've actually come second in, and you'll realise as part of a longer-term strategy this really could become a big party in British politics.'

He was hidden by the media scrum for the duration of the press conference and had to fight his way into his car as he left. Mr Farage was mobbed by photographers, camera people and journalists as he arrived in Smith Square in central London to unveil the poster truck. Earlier Mr Farage played down a run of opinion polls which suggest his support is on the wane, insisting his party is'more in tune' with the British public. Although the posters include a pledge to control the UK's borders, the word immigration does not feature. The leader was joined by Ukip MP Mark Reckless and other senior Ukip figures, each other them holding an over-sized pledge card in front of the billboard. But Clacton MP Douglas Carswell, who defected from the Tories last year, did not attend the event as he was campaigning in his constituency. Last year Mr Farage warned that people would not vote for Ukip unless he broadened its appeal beyond his own profile. 'I don't think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it's a one-man band. I intend to change that over the summer,' he said in May 2014. But Mr Farage today brushed aside questions about the use of his photograph on the card. He said: 'The thing about Ukip is we have become the most eclectic, diverse political party. 'We've got all shades of opinion, we've got people from the left, people from the right, people of all ages, all classes, all races. 'We are quite reflective I think now as a party of what modern Britain is.' Mr Farage insisted that smaller parties will have major influence in an election which no party will win outright.

Plaintiff Ellen Pao told jurors the colleague, Ajit Nazre, first approached her romantically during a trip to Germany after she had been struck by a cab. She was dazed from her injuries and couldn't object to his advances, she said. In court on Tuesday: Ellen Pao(left) leaves the courthouse during a lunch break from her trial in which she claimed her former colleague Ajit Nazre (right) made sexual advances after she was in a car accident. 'I got hit by a cab and then he tried to hit on me,' Pao said. Under further questioning by Lynne Hermle, an attorney for defendant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Pao said she and the co-worker eventually had an affair and she told him she loved him. Pao claims in her lawsuit that she was denied a promotion at the firm because of gender bias and then fired after she complained. Her lawsuit has spotlighted gender imbalance at elite Silicon Valley investment companies that are stacked with some of the nation's most accomplished graduates - multiple degree holders from schools such as Stanford and Harvard who are competing aggressively to back the next Google or Amazon. Women, however, are grossly underrepresented in the venture capital and technology sectors. Pao addressed that issue under questioning by her attorney, saying her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector. 'I've tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path,' she told jurors. 'I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists.' Improper treatment: Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao is suing her former employer, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, for $16 million alleging she was sexually harassed by male officials. Pao was questioned for the first time by Hermle. Their exchanges were often tense, with Pao staring at the lawyer and pausing before responding yes or no. Hermle also showed emails to the jury in which Pao and the co-worker exchanged compliments and banter. In one email from 2006, after the affair began, Pao wrote that she was always looking out for Nazre- 'never stopped, never will.' In text messages that year, she said she didn't think he was a bad person and she wasn't mad at him for not being able to have a real relationship at the time. Pao previously testified that she began the affair after the colleague said his wife had left him. She said she broke it off several months later when she learned that was a lie. Gender equality: Ellen Pao, pictured on Tuesday, said her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector. After she ended the affair, Pao testified, the colleague retaliated by shutting her out of emails and meetings. When she raised the retaliation issue with management, a senior partner explained how he had met his wife at another company while he was married, and perhaps Pao could have the same outcome with her colleague, she testified. The firm did nothing about the retaliation, she said. When it came to Pao's application to work at Kleiner Perkins, Hermle talked about the job requirements. The position called for the candidate to have a sense of humor, be intelligent, analytical, thorough, and humble, reports Business Insider. 'You understand what humble means, Ms. Pao,' Hermle asked. 'Modest, not arrogant, someone who does not exaggerate their skills,' Pao answered. 'It would also include someone who does not think they\u2019re better than their partners?' Hermle countered. Millions in damages: Ellen Pao, pictured on March 3 and on February 26, is seeking $16 million for discrimination and retaliation in a lawsuit against the firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers. Pao also told jurors that she had sought $10 million from the firm in exchange for voluntarily leaving, saying she believed the figure would prompt the firm to change its treatment of women. Pao did not receive the money and continued working at the firm. Her lawsuit seeks $16 million in damages. Pao said she made $400,000 a year, excluding bonuses, at Kleiner Perkins, and is making $170,000 a year, with a target bonus of $80,000, as interim CEO of Reddit, her current job. Pao, 45, said Kleiner Perkins repeatedly dismissed her attempts to open a discussion about gender bias and instead hired an antagonistic investigator to look into her complaint. Kleiner Perkins has denied wrongdoing and says Pao didn't get along with her colleagues and performed poorly as a junior partner. Pao was composed on the stand under questioning by her lawyer, even while discussing potentially emotional topics such as her firing. She said Steve Hirschfeld, an investigator", "abstract": "Ellen Pao, who is suing Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for gender bias, testified that she did not reject the initial romantic advances of a male colleague and even discussed having children with him. Pao claims that she was denied a promotion at the firm because of gender bias and then fired after she complained. Her lawsuit has spotlighted gender imbalance at elite Silicon Valley investment companies that are stacked with some of the nation's most accomplished graduates."}

In a video uploaded to Vine, Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander\u00a0Terry Virts. As her short dark crop is trimmed into shape, she uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters. She also clings tightly to a rail to ensure she maintains a steady position in the microgravity environment. An 'after' photograph of the salon session shows it was a success, with no strands out of place or chunks missing. Virts, 47, of Baltimore, Maryland, joked that he could be gearing up for a'second career after astronaut'. Scroll down for video.

He and Cristoforetti are currently on a six-month mission with Expedition 43 to the International Space Station. They are set to return to Earth on May 14. To date the clip of their hairdressing antics has been watched more than 50,000 times. Many fans have thanked them for sharing the behind-the-scenes footage. It's not the first time Virts has cut\u00a0Cristoforetti's hair. On January 1 he gave the flight engineer a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter. Luckily her short hair is easy to manage but female astronauts with longer locks often find 'bad hair days' are part of the job. In 2013, Karen Nyberg revealed how it was difficult to wash her long blonde hair in space. The mechanical engineer was on board Expedition 36 to the International Space Station at the time. In a video uploaded to Twitter Ms Nyberg was seen placing water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles. Smooth hair: A head shot of Cristoforetti before her space mission.

She then worked leave-in shampoo through her hair. It was seen stood on its end as she worked a comb through it. Her tools were stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping. To finish, she towel-dried her head dry. She claimed the results left her barnet feeling'squeaky clean' For men, shaving is the same as it is on Earth. Although, again, they  use a vacuum device so that stray hairs do not to float away. Elsewhere on the grooming front, astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers as\u00a0water clings to the body instead of running down it in microgravity,. There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS) \u00a0- no more than 4 liters per wash - so taking sponge baths also saves water. In microgravity, water clings to the body instead of running down it, so astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers. There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS) so taking sponge baths also saves water. In space, astronauts use a no-rinse shampoo to wash their hair, and apply the shampoo using a towel, vigorously rub their hair and scalp. They then use a towel to wipe their hair clean. The reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs don't float around the station. 'Astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts' eyes,' explained the Canadian Space Agency. 'Loose hair can also clog filters and affect air circulation and filtration.' Shaving in space is similar to shaving on Earth; astronauts just have to be careful not to let stray whiskers escape into the air, like with a haircut. Astronauts shave with foam or an electric razor, but most are said to prefer the latter, because it doesn't require water and automatically collects hair. And, no water is wasted, because as it dries on a person's head, it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water. Space woman: It's not the first time Virts has cut Cristoforetti's hair - on January 1 he gave a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter.

{"article": "James Heathcote, 26, was jailed for five months after admitting inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity whilst in a position of trust. A supply teacher tried to pester two teenager schoolgirls into a threesome despite being warned about his flirty behaviour by colleagues, a court heard. James Heathcote, 26, a former sports coach, was employed by St Helena School in Colchester, Essex, after being sacked from his previous job when a female colleague accused him of sexually harassment. While there he groomed two besotted pupils and pestered them to fulfill his fantasy of having a threesome. The supply teacher even exposed himself to the pair over a webcam as he traded explicit messages referring to bondage and strip tease fantasies. He was only caught when a fellow pupil reported the explicit messages before he could convince the impressionable girls to go through with his plan. Heathcote, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, fought back tears in the dock at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday\u00a0as he was jailed for five months. He was also ordered to sign the sexual offenders register for seven years. Heathcote admitted two charges of inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity whilst in a position of trust  but denied a third charge of sexual touching, involving allegedly kissing a pupil, which will now lie on file. As he passed sentence Judge David Turner QC said: 'Young women in school are entitled to be protected - even from themselves. 'You were the subject of some attention from female pupils and you may have found that flattering, but you should not have acted on it. 'You exchanged messages that were plainly, openly and explicitly sexual. 'You made references to bed, sex, intercourse, tying up and 'banging'. 'The sexual nature of these messages is unmistakable. 'You had asked for a 'threesome' with the young women, which they refused. 'It needs to be understood that people in a school setting owe a duty of care to the young people in their charge. 'You have fallen far short in that duty.' Heathcote joined the school as a part-time supply teacher in Spring 2013 before taking up a full time role in September 2013 and moving into a house on school property. His flirty nature with pupils was noted by colleagues who warned him to discourage his young female admirers. He ignored the advice before swapping phone numbers with two female schoolgirls in October 2013 when they complained about struggling with exam stress. A judge said Heathcote had 'fallen far short' of his duty  when he groomed the two besotted teenagers. The messages soon spread onto social media sites, including Instagram and Facebook, where the exchanges became sexual in nature as he begged the girls to share intimate pictures. On one occasion he even exposed himself to both girls  whilst chatting to them on FaceTime as they sat in their nightwear. Allan Compton, prosecuting, said: 'Police went through some of the Facebook messages to one girl which did contain significant sexual content. 'The messages described fantasies about being tied up, strip tease, as well as fantasies about having a threesome.' By January 2014, Heathcote had suggested a threesome to both girls and bombarded one with a staggering 242 text messages over a seven day period. Both had admitted during the exchanges that they would have sex with him separately but refused his request of a threesome. The explicit messaging only ended when a fellow pupil reported her suspicions and police were called in. Heathcote joined St Helena School, Chelmsford, pictured, as a part-time supply teacher in Spring 2013. Heathcote was arrested and contacted both girls asking them to delete all messages in a failed bid to cover his tracks. Mr Compton added: 'The aggravating features of this offending include the use of grooming behaviour and the soliciting of sexual images from the girls. 'There is, within the last text, an element of cover up when he invites them to delete text messages. 'It would appear that arrangements had been put in place to escalate to full sexual activity but, thankfully, it did not.' The court heard how Heathcote had been dismissed from a previous role as a school sports coach in October 2012 following an allegation of sexual harassment from an adult female work colleague. Peter Barlex, mitigating, said his client had been working as a cover supervisor at the school full-time since September 2013. He said: 'This was a situation that got out of hand. 'It is something he bitterly regrets ever getting involved in. 'This was a profession he had really set his sights upon but which has now gone.' Heathcote was jailed for five months and was made to sign onto the sex offenders register for seven years. He was also made the subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order banning him from unsupervised contact with under 18s without a guardian's consent. St Helena School is a secondary school in Colchester, Essex, with more than 1,000 pupils.

{"article": "A retired Wisconsin sheriff's deputy accused of murdering his wife and her sister appeared in court and plead not guilty to the crime, blaming it on the side effects from ALS. Andrew Steele, 40, of Fitchburg, claims that the terminal disease - which he was diagnosed with in June - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affected his brain making him unable to obey the law. Steele argued that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses, according to TwinCities.com. ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, was wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Case: Steele argued that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses. Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. The former cop spoke in court, briefly, for the first time since he was charged with first-degree intentional homicide for the murders of his wife, Ashlee Steele, 39, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, 38, of Lake Elmo, at the Steele home in Fitchburg on August 22, 2014. Tollefsbol called 911 and told a dispatcher that her brother-in-law had shot her before she died. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. However, the motive for the slayings remains a mystery. The sisters have left six children behind. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them. In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account. Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years. His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 percent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.

{"article": "Apology: David Duckenfield says he never had the chance to say sorry over the Hillsborough disaster. The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today said that he had never previously apologised for lying to officials because he had 'never found an opportunity' to do so. David Duckenfield told the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 that he had not spoken out because was worried about being misrepresented. The former officer also admitted he was 'possibly in denial' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans, leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the Sheffield stadium. He told the jury he was a Freemason at the time of the accident, but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent. And he denied taking part in a 'cover-up' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to Liverpool fans' bad behaviour. Yesterday, Mr Duckenfield said he 'apologised unreservedly' to the families of the victims who were killed in the opening minutes of the game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Shortly before kick-off the officer - who had never previously overseen a major football match - ordered a gate to be opened in order to ease overcrowding outside the ground, but this allowed fans to rush into to already packed terraces. When fans started dying, Mr Duckenfield told Football Association officials that'some fans have got in through a gate', which he now admits was a 'terrible lie'. Rajiv Menon QC, lawyer for the victims' families, asked him why it took him 26 years to 'come clean' over his 'critical mistakes'. Mr Duckenfield, 70, replied: 'I was possibly in denial and I never found a venue or an opportunity where I could meet with someone and speak to them honestly and openly and ensure that my thought and my feelings would be reported fairly. 'Yesterday this court gave me the opportunity to sit here and apologise fully for the first time without fear of anybody misrepresenting what I was saying.' Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pushed up against barriers on the overcrowded terrace. He denied saying anything inaccurate to FA officials Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton, but confessed he had told a 'lie by omission' for failing to mention that he gave the order to open the gate, and added that it was his family who told him what he had done. He said: 'I have spoken to my family, who are genuine people, and I have said I am troubled by this situation and they said to me, \"Well you obviously lied because you didn't tell the whole truth.\"' Mr Duckenfield, who was promoted to be an area commander at South Yorkshire Police two weeks before the semi-final, told the jury that he was not a'reasonably competent match commander' due to his lack of experience. Asked if he was a member of the Freemasons at the time of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield said, 'I was,' adding that he had joined the organisation in 1975 and was made Worshipful Master of his local lodge in 1990. He said he did not know whether the chief constable of his force or other senior officers were in the Masons because it was not seen as 'acceptable' to be a senior policeman and a Freemason. Mr Menon asked if Mr Duckenfield's promotion to chief superintendent in March 1989 was anything to do with his membership of the Masons. He replied: 'I would not know but I would hope not. Nobody ever spoke to me about it.' At one point Mr Menon put it to Mr Duckenfield that there had been a 'false narrative' after the disaster which sought to blame Liverpool fans for what had happened and conceal the truth about police failings. After pausing to consider his answer, Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I disagree. There was no conspiracy as far as I am concerned.' Rejecting claims that he suspected there were fatalities by the time he spoke to Mr Kelly, Mr Duckenfield added: 'I don't think I was involved in any cover-up whatsoever. 'My main objective was a rescue operation and to do the very best I could for all concerned. It was chaotic, hectic, stressful.' Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster. After claiming that no one in the court room would understand the position he found himself in, Mr Duckenfield was asked why he had concealed the truth from Mr Kelly. 'Sir, I said yesterday, I don't know,' Mr Duckenfield responded. Mr Menon then said to the former officer: 'That's not the way that a competent match commander behaves, is it Mr Duckenfield, lying to the chief executive of the Football Association when people are dying on the pitch feet away?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'Sir, under normal circumstances, as I have said, outside in the street or in an", "abstract": "David Duckenfield, the police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster, has apologised for lying to officials about the tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989.

Drug addict Nicholas Lovell was speeding in his Citroen Picasso when he ploughed into\u00a0Ross, 34, and Clare Simons, 30. The couple, who had been riding the bike on the way to visit friends in Hanham, Bristol, were pronounced dead at the scene. This shocking picture reveals the mangled wreck of a tandem bike which belonged to 'perfect couple' Ross, 34, and Clare Simons, 30, who were tragically killed by a banned driver. Mr and Mrs Simons were killed almost instantly when drug addict Nicholas Lovell's speeding Citroen Picasso ploughed into them. Lovell - who has 69 previous convictions - was later jailed for just ten-and-a-half years for causing their deaths. Now relatives of the Simons have released the dramatic picture of the aftermath of the crash as part of their campaign for tougher sentences for banned drivers. It shows how the car snapped the bike clean in half, with the front half getting lodged in the grille. Heroin addict Lovell, 38, had crashed into the couple as he tried to outrun police - with a 16 month old baby and 12-year-old in his vehicle. A court hearing in May 2013 heard that he then left them dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'. The couple's tandem bike, which they had been riding at the time of the crash, was snapped clean in half by the force of the crash. Jailing Lovell at Bristol Crown Court in May 2013, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'This is the worst example one could imagine of this sort of offence. 'You have a serious drug problem but your deep selfishness and disregard for others is breathtaking.' His partner Louise Cox, 35, was jailed for twelve months for trying to cover up the fact he was illegally driving her Citroen Picasso. Lovell - who has 69 previous convictions - was later jailed for just ten-and-a-half years for causing their deaths. Lovell pleaded guilty to two counts of death by dangerous driving and was given the maximum possible sentence under current guidelines. But Ross and Clare's family reckon he will be released after five years - meaning he will serve just two-and-a-half years for each life he took. On Thursday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling visited the site with local Kingswood MP Chris Skidmore and the family to discuss further changes and lay flowers. One potential change includes making sure sentences for multiple deaths are served one after the other, instead of at the same time. Mr Grayling said: 'I don't like the idea of people like this coming out half way through the sentence. 'It is shocking to walk here in a normal suburban street and see what can happen. I can only imagine the trauma and turmoil the family must have been through.' Kelly Woodruff, 33, Ross's sister, said the family would continue to fight for tougher laws in the hope of preventing future deaths. She thanked Mr Skidmore, who has supported the Justice for Ross and Clare campaign from the start. Mr Skidmore said: 'We have fought the campaign to get laws changed, which could already prevent future deaths but we want to go further. 'We want to keep this at the top of the agenda for whoever is in government to increase maximum sentences further.' The crash happened in Hanham, Bristol, near the couple's home in January 2013. In the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised Lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned. The scene in Bristol where tandem cyclists Ross and Clare Simons died after they were hit by Lovell - who has 69 previous convictions. Lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light, disappearing from view. Witnesses had described Lovell driving as 'exceptionally erratic, fast and dangerous'- with the speedo hitting 60mph- before they heard a 'loud, horrendous bang.' The court heard that Lovell was seen getting out of the steaming wreckage, followed by Cox who was cradling her baby. But the force of the impact instantly killed Ross and Clare, from Staple Hill, Bristol and left their new tandem bike in three pieces. Lovell fled the scene and left lying Cox to tell police a mystery man in a red sweater had been driving, leading detectives on a wild goose chase before Lovell handed himself in the next day when traces of drugs were found in his body. Despite finally pleading guilty, Lovell has never apologised for causing the couple's death. He also admitted driving while disqualified. Fifteen years ago Lovell warned he would either kill or be killed through his reckless driving. Piles of tributes were left to the popular couple and now their family have been campaigning for tougher sentences for banned drivers.

Around\u00a030 crates of feminine hygiene products were seized Friday at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut after electronic scanners detected radioactivity in the shipment. Tests revealed the shipment, which weighed 554 kilograms, had more than 35 times the safe levels of radioactivity. Around 30 crates of feminine hygiene products were seized Friday at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut after electronic scanners detected radioactivity in the shipment. The sanitary pads had originated in China, and arrived at the airport Friday from Dubai, officials said. After  failing to pass the radioactivity scanner test at the airport, the shipment's contents were examined at the Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission. The\u00a0Lebanon\u00a0Minister for Finance, the department which is responsible for customs, told Al-Joumhouriya newspaper:\u00a0'As a result of the examination of a number of boxes that contained sanitary pads, it appeared that the rate of radioactivity inside them was 35 times more than is permitted.' A half ton shipment of radioactive sanitary products, which were more than 35 times the safe level of radiation, was discovered by customs officials at a Lebanon airport. The sanitary towels were manufactured by Anion\u00a0which\u00a0purports the health benefits of anions- groups of\u00a0negatively charged ionized atoms. It is not known, but it may be possible the source of the radiation came from the production process. Ionization happens when atoms are given high-energy ionizing radiation, electrical voltage or high temperature. Atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles and are also radioactive. On the company website, Anions claim their pads and pantyliners contain an anion layer which 'emits intensive anion stream beneficial to human health in amount up to 5800 for cm3.' They go onto claims that anions are 'air vitamins' and'significantly benefit to human health and daily routine' boosting the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. A specialized judiciary launched an investigation into the case. The discovery was the latest in a series of radioactive finds at Beirut's airport and sea port amid an ongoing crackdown on radioactive imports. Last month, the Khalil ordered the Customs Department at the same airport to send back a shipment of 98 mobile phone covers from China that were revealed to be radioactive.", "abstract": "Customs officials at a Lebanon airport discovered a half ton shipment of radioactive sanitary products, which were more than 35 times the safe level of radiation.

{"article": "Hannah Green's 30th birthday is a day she will never forget but not for the reasons you might expect. At 20 weeks pregnant, it was also the day Hannah, now 31, discovered her unborn daughter Lola had a congenital heart disease and would need open heart surgery as soon as she was born. With no history of the condition in the family the unexpected news left Hannah and her partner Gerard Bradley, 30, from Gosport, Hampshire, devastated, and Hannah vowed to do everything she could to ensure her daughter had the best start in life. Scroll down for video. Hannah Green with daughter Lola, now a happy and healthy eight months old. Hannah said: 'It was my routine 20-week scan and they couldn't see the valve coming off the left hand side of the baby's heart. 'None of this affected the baby while it was inside me but once the baby was delivered they wouldn't be able to get enough oxygen.' Hannah and Gerard's baby had transposition of the great arteries, a rare heart defect in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed. Because of the shock diagnosis the couple decided to find out the sex of their unborn baby, which they had planned to keep a surprise. 'I felt like we needed to know her sex. I needed to feel something positive and connect with her. We didn't need any more surprises,' first time mum said. The diagnosis meant that Lola would need open heart surgery to switch the arteries back to their correct position as soon as she was born. Lola had open heart surgery when she was just ten days old in an eight-hour operation to swap arteries. Newborn Lola with proud parents Hannah and dad Gerard Bradley, a tattoo artist. 'It's so easy to take it for granted when you have a healthy baby. When you find out there's a problem with your baby that will require medical intervention you want to do anything you can to make it better.' So when Hannah attended London ExCel's Baby Show in February 2014 and came across stem cell banking company Precious Cells, she realised the procedure could prove priceless. Stem cells are found in the cord blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord, which are usually thrown away, after a baby is born. The stem cells are an exact DNA match to the baby and can help cure many life threatening diseases, such as leukaemia and sickle cell disease. Although stem cell banking is popular in America there are currently only four NHS hospitals in the UK offering the service. New parents \u2013 including Sky Sports presenter Natalie Pinkham who gave birth to her first child Wilfred in January - are using private stem cell banking companies instead. Hannah said: 'We were going to look for a crib and a pram and came away with information about stem cell banking.' Hannah feels comforted by knowing her daughter's precious stem cells will be there for her until she's 30. The family poses for a snap, with Lola, who wears a pacemaker to regulate her heart, grinning at the camera. 'There are so many different things that can be done with stem cells. Doctors are creating better and new ways of doing things all the time, and we realised this could help our baby when she's older. It could also protect any future children we have.' But with a price tag of more than \u00a32,000 the procedure was way out of Hannah and tattoo artist Gerard's price range. Luckily for Hannah Precious Cells was running a competition offering parents-to-be the chance to win free banking by explaining what the prize would mean to their family on the company's Facebook page. So Hannah \u2013 who until then had never won anything in her life - relayed her story and was stunned when she was chosen as the winner. The couple were given a box containing a special bag in which the cord blood could be stored, and the number of a phlebotomist who would come to the hospital and harvest the blood as soon as Lola was delivered. 'We had to call the number as soon as I went into labour and keep them updated on progress,' said Hannah, who was two weeks overdue when she finally went into labour in June last year. But because Lola's heart rate kept dropping she was born by emergency caesarean at Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton after a 36-hour labour, weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz. 'The phlebotomist was in the delivery room with us and she collected the cord blood and placenta straight away. She went into a separate room, took everything she needed and put it into a special bag. Then I was given the box back with the bag inside, and we had to call a courier to come and collect it.' Hannah Green says of Lola: 'We don't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future' Hannah Green had her daughter's stem cells harvested through Precious Cells. The courier arrived within hours of Lola's birth to collect the stem cells,", "abstract": "Hannah Green discovered her unborn daughter Lola had a congenital heart disease at her 20-week scan and would need open heart surgery as soon as she was born.

Ireland and Wales, who travel to Edinburgh and Rome respectively, are also in contention for the crown on a thrilling day of staggered kick-offs with points difference set to determine the winners. France stand before England and their dream of improving on a trio of successive runners-up finishes and given they are playing at Twickenham, top the table by a cushion of four points and will know their victory target, the Red Rose are in the driving seat. England captain Chris Robshaw in training this week as the Red Rose prepare to take on France. Robshaw carries England forward during their 25-13 home win over Scotland last weekend. Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup after England's triumph over Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday. 'All the guys are extremely excited and desperate to get that bit of silverware at the end, that significant trophy that we haven't managed to get,' Robshaw said. 'We've picked up little bits here and there, but of course we want to get the big prize at the end. 'Having gone so close in recent years has been tough for myself and the other guys involved. As a player you want to be picking up silverware. 'Unfortunately that's eluded us a couple of times. We've collected the odd bit here and there, but to finally pick up the main trophy would be great.' VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win. England trio James Haskell, Mike Brown and Robshaw sing the national anthem ahead of the Scotland game. Robshaw hopes England will be able to claim an even bigger prize this weekend in the Six Nations finale. Ireland prop Mike Ross admits that despite the frustration of seeing the Grand Slam dream end in Cardiff last Saturday, claiming back-to-back titles for the first time since 1949 would still provide a 'huge lift' ahead of the World Cup. 'It would be huge, it would be a huge one for us,' said Ross on the chance of retaining the title. 'It would certainly give us a huge lift going into the World Cup. It is something we really want as a squad.

Wales face a lunchtime appointment with Italy and could then endure the best part of a five-hour wait for the Ireland and England games to unfold before discovering if it is they who are champions.

Pakistan batted first at Eden Park and, after their innings was twice interrupted by rain, they lost their last five wickets for 25 runs to slump to 222 all out with a top score of 56 from Misbah-ul-Haq from their 46 overs. In reply, a score of 77 from 58 balls by AB de Villiers steadied the ship but South Africa failed to meet their victory target as they were bowled out for 202 after Mohammad Irfan, Rahat Ali and Wahab Riaz claimed three wickets apiece. The Pakistan team celebrate their 29-run victory over South Africa at the Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. Pakistan captain Mibah Ul-Haq (left) and team-mate Shahid Afridi smile as they leave the field. Pakistan openers Ahmed Shehzad and Sarfraz Ahmed had made a collective 30 when Shehzad was dismissed thanks to an exquisite catch from Dale Steyn off Kyle Abbott's bowling in the ninth over. The fast bowler, fielding at mid on, had to back-pedal considerably but made up enough ground before diving and snaffling a two-handed catch a mere inches from the ground. The Eden Park crowd roared excitedly when Sarfraz clubbed JP Duminy for successive sixes early in 16th over before adding a third maximum with the final ball of the over. AB de Villiers gave South Africa some hope but they were unable to record the required total against Pakistan. Wahab Riaz (left) celebrates with Ahmad Shahzad after claiming the last wicket of Imran Tahir (right) Pakistan has reached to 90 for one at the start of the 17th over, but a moment of madness saw Sarfraz run out attempting a second run to depart one run short of his fifty. Skipper De Villiers brought himself into the attack and was celebrating in his third over when Younus, having looked extremely comfortable, tamely chipped to cover to depart for 37 in the 27th over. Sohaib Maqsood (eight) lasted just 15 balls before he clipped Abbott to point as Pakistan's innings stalled somewhat at 156 for four at the end of the 32nd over. Umar Akmal (13) was undone by the bounce of Morne Morkel, top-edging to mid-wicket, to restrict Pakistan for 175 for five before rain delayed play for half an hour or so. Pakistan bowler Muhammad Irfan (left) and Sohaib Maqsood celebrate their win against South Africa. Francois du Plessis of South Africa crashes into the wickets during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match. Misbah collected his 42nd ODI half-century when play resumed before the players were forced from the field once again as the showers returned. The second interruption did Pakistan no favours as they lost their last five wickets for just 25 runs, crumbling from 195 for five in the 41st over to 222 all out in their allotted 47 overs. Shahid Afridi edged Dale Steyn to deep-backward square-leg to depart for 22 in the 42nd over and, three balls later, they were seven down when Riaz was pinned leg before by Imran Tahir. Steyn removed Misbah in the next over for a team-high 56 and Ali and Sohail Khan fell shortly after as Pakistan collapsed spectacularly.

South Afrcia's innings was only two balls old when they lost Quinton de Kock, caught behind off Irfan, without scoring and they were two down in the 10th over when Ali tricked Faf du Plessis (27) into edging behind. Pakistan wicketkeeper Sarfraz picked up his and Pakistan's third dismissal in the very next over when Riaz forced Hashim Amla into a leading edge to depart for 38 from 27 deliveries. Riaz accounted for Rilee Rossouw (six) in the 13th over to leave South Africa four down with just 74 runs on the board and things went from bad to worse when they lost David Miller (nought) moments later.
