In Neolithic times, trepanation was thought to be a cure for epilepsy, migraines, and even emergency surgery for battle wounds, and the implement often used was made from obsidian. Obsidian is one of the sharpest substances found in nature and can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels, rivaling diamond in the fineness of its edge. Even today, surgeons are using obsidian scalpels to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring, and incisions made with these blades heal faster.

She teamed up with the Havre university in France, where researchers have developed a technique to reproduce the human smell, and is offering families a small box containing a vial of the departed's odour that they would have extracted from a piece of material provided by them.

Scientists from the University of Michigan have found that the hypothalamus, a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells, is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin. The research focused on POMC neurons, which send and receive signals to regulate appetite, and found that when these neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The researchers looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene, regulating how often and when the cells use the gene to create signal molecules that then go out to the body.

This comes in the wake of Nico Rosberg's moaning over the team radio during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix about how slow team-mate Lewis Hamilton was driving.

An incredible video created by filmmaker Michael König from Cologne, Germany, shows the beauty of the solar surface as it bursts with energy, including plasma raining down on the sun, an extreme solar eruption and even a comet breezing through the sun’s atmosphere. The video was made by stitching together footage from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft over five years, and features excerpts of 4K full-disk pictures in extreme ultraviolet channels. By watching the sun in different wavelengths, scientists can watch how material courses through the corona, which holds clues to what causes eruptions and why the sun's magnetic fields are constantly on the move.
