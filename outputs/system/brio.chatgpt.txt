In Neolithic times, trepanation was thought to be a cure for epilepsy, migraines, and even emergency surgery for battle wounds. The implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from obsidian, a type of volcanic glass. Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels, and incisions made with these blades heal faster and with less scarring.

Steven Gerrard's Liverpool career will end in Stoke rather than Wembley as he had hoped. Gerrard had hoped to end his 25-year association with Liverpool by lifting the FA Cup on his 35th birthday before starting his new adventure with LA Galaxy. However, Liverpool's defeat to Aston Villa in Sunday's semi-final will take time to get over, and with the injured Lucas Leiva facing two weeks out, it is inconceivable to think Gerrard will not start Liverpool's next two games.

Her product will provide 'olfactory comfort' to customers and will be priced at around 560 euros (£400). The process involves taking a person's clothes and extracting the odour, which represents about a hundred molecules, and reconstructing it in the form of a perfume in four days.
Scientists have found that POMC neurons, which regulate appetite, are a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells that act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. When these neurons are absent or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The research was done on fish and mice and could lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume.
Thieves have stolen hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash from a safe deposit company in Hatton Garden, London. The robbery is believed to have taken place over the Easter weekend, and police are carrying out a "slow and painstaking" forensic examination to establish the identities of those affected.

The agency started off with just five models and now has 40 including Noreen Carr.

ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory, but the east was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit.

A majority of the British public do not want Camilla to become Queen if Prince Charles succeeds to the throne, according to a poll for the Daily Mail. The poll also shows that the nation is completely split on whether Charles should become king at all, with 43% of the public backing him to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as Britain’s next monarch. William and Prince Harry are the most popular members of the Royal Family, closely followed by the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge.

The plan includes two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool, and will include a sophisticated filtration system to turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido. The lido will be run as a social enterprise rather than a company dictated by profit and will benefit the local community while also creating a haven for wildlife.

Businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to serve same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers, even if they have religious objections, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. The poll found that 57% of Americans believe businesses such as caterers or florists should serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. The survey also found that age differences hold across party lines, but the generation gap among Republicans and Republican-leaners is larger than that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.

Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson has said that Hernandez is a master manipulator who knows how to use his charm and manipulate better than anyone he has ever seen.

The UK over-the-counter medicines market, which includes painkillers and anti-fungal creams, is worth £2.5bn, with brands vying for attention with brightly coloured packaging and promises that are questionable under scrutiny.

The Suzy Lamplugh Trust (SLT) has criticised online retailers for selling T-shirts with slogans such as "I heart my stalker" and "Some people call it stalking. I call it love!" The SLT argues that these slogans play into people's fear of being laughed at, which prevents victims from seeking help to deal with stalkers and puts them at a higher risk of being attacked. According to the SLT, stalking is a serious crime that affects one in six women and can include disturbing emails, non-stop phone calls, creepy letters and social media abuse.
